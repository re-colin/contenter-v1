@matthewanipen2418:
I learned more in 15 minutes than I have in 40 years regarding this topic. I understand how college is designed to extract the best of the best to go into the business world, but it really leaves the general public behind by not starting out teaching in the way your video did. (dog might not be 100% necessary) Not that I would become a programmer, but to quickly get that this isnt something that only geniuses can manage to contemplate makes me want to give a big middle finger to the elitist education system. Anyway, thank you for this!


@cooloak8096:
7:57 Is this why so much of the color space on computers is almost-indistinguishable shades of green at full value and saturation? Because they're secretly standing in for turquoise that the screen can't display? I've wondered about this my whole life! I thought maybe I was minorly colorblind in green, or something.


@CharlieCGofficial:
0:42 am I the only one who noticed that “abstraction” is missing the c


@Johnny_Franco-12_Scratch:
10:19 a cosmic ray flips a bit


@HanzCastroyearsago:
i love how at the start you can also get a feel of how compression works, if your question gives you a final answer without having to ask all the questions, you can move on to the next set of questions to get the next answer


@johnwitt:
0:42 you mispelled "abstraction"


@m4rt_:
Though, do note that with the more abstraction you introduce, you do make things easier to do without having to think a lot about it, but you also limit the performance gains you are able to do, because you then have limited yourself to only doing what that abstraction allows for.  Also, it introduces overhead to do the abstraction, that in some cases aren't needed.  So if you can, try to fit the abstraction around the data it will be operating on, rather than trying to fit it around every possible input.  Also, you should be willing to use a different abstraction, or no abstraction at all if your data differs enough from the intended data for the abstraction.  This way you still get the ease of use from using abstractions, while limiting the performance impact that might have.  Also, not everything needs to be abstracted, sometimes it's just easier to just do it manually, as introducing abstractions can make it harder to do what you want to do, especially if the intended goal for the abstraction has changed over time.


@dafoex:
Another interesting thought: We didn't always do it this way.  The Harwell Dekatron computer (also called the W.I.T.C.H) used dekatron tubes which store a decimal number.


@siz1700:
8:07 I see what you did there


@RadioactiveBluePlatypus:
10:05 idk if you took a recording of your YouTube page or if you chose these videos manually but if it was manual, DAMN THOSE ARE BASED VIDEO CHOICES. 

"Art, Furries, God" by Patricia Taxxon,
Tantacrul's video on corporate music,
That one guy whose name escapes me but it's the second to last thumbnail (the one where it says "concept albums" on it

Ok I'm gonna be honest there's less videos I recognize than I thought at first glance but I MUST REHITERATE, "Art, Furries, God" BY PATRICIA TAXXON. ULTRA BASED ALERT.


@gumballegal:
I'm gonna store my data in As and Bs


@proboiz_50:
You're understanding binary because you have binary device


@santacloudy:
i both understood and did not understand  parts of this video, and i work as a software engineer


@dabid999:
10:06 I really fell for this


@louminisalouminios9559:
I'm more confused than before
