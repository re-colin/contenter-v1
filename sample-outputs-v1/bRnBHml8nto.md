Description: 
 We can find charlatans peddling snake oil in a wide variety of spheres, but there are quite a lot of lies that are told specifically about water. It's such a ubiquitous substance, everywhere around us, and inside of us, and since we need it to survive, it's fertile grounds for pseudoscience. What kinds of lies do people tell about water? There are many colorful examples we will cover, but this first part will focus on the main conspiracy surrounding water, and that is the fluoridation of tap water. From government mind control to neurotoxic effects, there is no shortage of misinformation associated with this incredible achievement of modern society, so let's run through the most common talking points and see what they're all about, shall we?

 This dude needs to do better homework. No level of fluoride is good for you and it does have side effects even in lower doses over time

 Poor video and poor form going down the conspiracy theory narrative.   The science is not settled on this and the fluoride in water isn&#39;t the same as what you&#39;d find in toothpaste.  Many conspiracy theories have come true over the years, it&#39;s just a way to smear people who can identify bullshit.

 Calcium fluoride helps teeth, sodium fluoride is a chemical waste that causes cancer and other serious illnesses. 

 	Replies: ['Future World X', 'So where is your evidence for that claim? Also is there a significant difference between Calcium Fluoride and Sodium Fluoride?', 'Paul Mahoney', 'The result of dissolving sodium fluoride in water is sodium anions and fluoride cations.

You basically just said that sodium ions cause cancer when in fact they are an essential mineral. Get an education, moron.']

 Do not trust this guy. You are bathing in it, watering your plants with it, giving it to your livestock. It is a neurotoxin. Look into the history of fluoride. Give this guy and his family all the fluoride that he wants. Drop it off at his house for free. However, he will need a hazmat suite to handle it.

 The only real problem with fluoride is that most insurance companies don’t cover it so the patient has to pay out of pocket for it.<br><br>To be fair, it’s less science-focused and more so how our healthcare system is set up.

 Hmm? This is the first time I’ve ever came across this fluoride/water minor conspiracy. I guess that is what you would call it.   After hear this whole story for first time Doesn’t common sense make you ask the question… Why REALLY is the government putting fluoride in the water? I know you just explained it, but really?  Just cause the government decided one day they wanted to help out parents with there kids teeth health?? At no extra cost? Why stop there, why not add some vitamins? Or any thing else we can mix with our water that’s healthy?

 Skeletal fluorosis? No one is arguing that fluoride displaces calcium in your teeth and stands up to acids better but to say it has no negative effects on the body is pseudoscience my friend. Brittle bone disease, it’s not just discolored teeth. Why not fix our diets instead of a bandaid. 

 	Replies: ['3nd1ess', '\u200b@Midlife Reset If you actually watched the video, you&#39;d learn that fluoride in our water is MINISCULE compared to how much is needed to even make you feeling ill, let alone kill you. Also the video you linked misrepresents the paper. The paper&#39;s suggest that the concentration of fluoride should be lowered, not removed completely. Also, keep in mind, this is 2 papers made by the same group. Has there been anyone else that can replicate the findings that fluoride can lower the IQ of fetuses inside a pregnant woman&#39;s womb? Are we sure the fluoride is the cause of the issue? Or is it set to another incredible set of factors that you&#39;d have to run thousands of tests on to verify?

 The only possible conspiracy I&#39;ve heard about fluoride in water is that it was a convenient way to get rid of a fluoride as a waste product for gypsum or something.  Which says nothing about it being harmful, but would hint that maybe it isn&#39;t as helpful as claimed. <br>I pretty much brush it off

 Flouride causes cancer and brain damage--that&#39;s why the NAZIs fluoridated the water in occupied Poland; they hoped these adverse side effects would help to pacify the Poles, making them less willing to rebel against NAZI tyranny/evil.  It is the toxic waste from uranium mining; rather than pay a fortune to safely dispose of it, they conned us into adding it to our water for the false claim it prevented cavities.

 When you drive, you can’t control wether or not somebody else is going to crash into you or put you in a situation where you need a seatbelt to save your life.<br><br>If you are brushing your teeth daily and avoiding the sugary American diet, you wouldn’t need fluoride in your water. If you miss a day of brushing your teeth, as even very health concerned people occasionally do, having fluoride in your water is not going to save your life or your oral hygiene in any way that is comparable to what a seatbelt can do if you get in a terrible car crash.<br><br>This is a really poor comparison. Somebody who never has an off day when it comes to oral hygiene is never going to need extra fluoride in their water, but somebody who is never distracted and follows all of the rules of the road at all times will need a seat belt as a safety precaution against other dangerous drivers.<br><br>Where is the equivalent drunk driver causing an unpreventable crash for oral hygiene? 

 	Replies: ['Jonathan Chow', '@Xavier Dimoff A few takeaway I can take from your more cohesive response.<br><br>Yes, I see the validity of your criticism here, about the bad fallacy  of fluoride being wrongfully correlated to Heath problem rather than bad Plumbing materials.<br><br>The biggest problem is your analogies being, to be honest awful at proving your point and also the lack of clarity in your comment, from everyone&#39;s perspective you sound like a science denier for bringing a seemingly irrelevant idea to the table.<br><br>Now that you had clarity your thoughts,  the ideas you gave are reasonable and is connected to the question at hand.<br><br>As for Dave&#39;s mean spirited response, well that&#39;s par for the course when he deals with apologists, people in denial, and or trolls, you may not like the hammer of descent it shows and that&#39;s ok.<br><br>But the movement of anti-science is growing and the allowance of it to flourish is poisonous to society and needs to be fought tooth and nail.<br><br>Thank you for the comments and I enjoyed this conversation we had.', 'Xavier Dimoff', '@Professor Dave Explains Please don’t reply unless you are willing to read everything I have to say without taking any offense you may have out on me. I know it’s a long comment, but I am simply being thorough in my thoughts because I respect you and your efforts, even if I disagree with the way you act sometimes.<br><br><br>You call yourself Professor Dave and the primary purpose of this channel is to make a public record of your lectures. This channel is as close as you can get to your classroom when you taught university and your replies to comments is as close to office hours as a subscriber can get. <br><br>You remind me of a few other content creators I’ve encountered across other subjects. The two that come to mind are very intelligent people, but they both have such negative instinctual reactions to any form of dissent, that they have mostly driven away all opposing viewpoints, no matter how minor.<br><br>Anytime anybody has a mild critique or criticism, the initial reaction is to mock and belittle that person in the same manner as the most absurdly brainwashed commenters.<br><br>Mr. Dave, you literally called your own analogy inane and irrelevant. I don’t expect you to have every line of your video memorized, but your own initial negative attitude and reaction to my comment made you insult yourself.<br><br>I know you have a lot of brainwashed conspiracy nuts in your comment sections and it seems that you get some sort enjoyment from mocking them and treating them like shit, but it has bled into disrespecting and demeaning me for trying to point out a flaw in your analogy. When the only times you give any sort of detailed response to comments is to act like a vindictive asshole, it does nothing to help educate people and instead pushes people away from listening.<br><br>I was not intentionally trying to miss your point as I pointed out to another commenter here, but I am willing to admit that I did miss the point of your analogy and overanalyze it. I can’t say what would have happened had I put it into better context of issues concerning water and the supply of it to the people living in the US. I haven’t personally seen you reply to any comments that can’t be construed in a negative way in a substantial manner. I do hope that is just a result of not having seen enough of your comment threads.<br><br>In case you are still reading, I am now going to make a criticism of something you said unrelated to the analogy.<br><br>In theory, adding fluoride to tap water should help those who are the most vulnerable to dental issues. The biggest issue is that the people who are at the highest risk for developing dental issues are also the people who are at the highest risk for lead poisoning.  <br><br>I don’t remember if it was this video or in part 2 where you cover that, but you mentioned it as if it isn’t prevalent enough of an issue to be concerned about or give any more thought and time to than mentioning it in passing. The fact is that millions of Americans all across the country are exposed to lead in their drinking water through lead pipes. Many low income families are affected by this and as we both know, education and low income households is not a good match. <br><br>The craze and panic over fluoride is stupid, but the reason why so many gullible people reach these conclusions is not. What should be anger at the lead pipes is misdirected to fluoride. There may be a lot of ignorant people, but their fears are very often real and simply mocking and berating them for being less informed and educated than you helps nobody. People’s minds are not changed through force, but instead with care and understanding. If the point of fluoridating water is to help those who are most vulnerable, then there should be a concerted effort to address issues such as being able to go to the dentist being tied to employment or wealth. If we want the vulnerable to be protected, then we need to address the issue of lead pipes running through nearly 10 million American homes. If tap water was 100% guaranteed to have no chance of lead in it, then trust in tap water would slowly grow.<br><br>The least educated people that watch your videos are at the highest risk for lead poisoning and in one of these videos you told them that not wanting to drink very likely contaminated tap water is a slap in the face to their ancestors. For somebody who is ignorant, they may respond by saying that you are an idiot and implying you are a government agent and not take what you say seriously. Other people might react by unknowingly drinking tap water with lead in it.', 'Xavier Dimoff', '@Jonathan Chow If the government is doing this because of how it helps people who are most vulnerable of dental disasters, then it would also seem to reasonably follow that they should make going to the dentist affordable for the most vulnerable people. <br><br>This is to help the most vulnerable people, right? Low income families are much more vulnerable due to the low income and these kind of families also happen to be at the highest risk for lead poisoning. <br><br>Putting fluoride in the water to help the most vulnerable, who happen to be the most vulnerable to having lead in their water is somewhat similar to giving loans to poor people who need them, but ripping them off with interest.<br><br>I wan’t intentionally trying to misread anything with his analogy. I don’t think that it is fair to say that I was strawmanning Dave’s analogy as I wasn’t trying to say that he believed the way in which I analyzed it. I feel like it is very fundamental to the analogy to recognize the difference between a precautionary measure and a preventative measure. <br><br>I may have gotten a little too caught up into it and missed the point. Considering Dave’s immediate reaction as well as his tendency to only give more than a sentence reply to people if he thinks they are conspiracy nuts or idiots I don’t get the feeling that he would have replied to me at all or if he did, it would have been somewhere along the lines of the same disrespect that he mostly shows in the comments.', 'Jonathan Chow', 'This I say is a poor analogy.<br><br>First of all if put into this context yes, your statement is technically true it misses the point altogether.<br><br>Fluoride is a big part of dental hygiene for those who refuse or do not diligently brush their teeth. And while following all the rules of the road still require you to wear a seatbelt for your and everyone elses safety, the same goes for fluoride, it&#39;s added into water to assist those most vulnerable of dental disasters so while you may not need it, someone else does.<br><br>Before you say oh why not they do it for their own good? This is the problem you can&#39;t always tell people what to do, people do as they please, and someone has to do this for their and your own interests whatever it is the government or your parents.<br><br>This is why I feel that your statement is deceptively dishonest, you, in my opinion made a strawman analogy and called it a day.', 'Professor Dave Explains', '@Xavier Dimoff It&#39;s not an &quot;echo chamber&quot; to mock people who regurgitate the same bullshit I debunk in videos they&#39;re too afraid to watch, as is the case with the overwhelming majority of detractors on any of my debunks, of any variety.

 if adding fluoride to public water is &quot;cutting edge&quot; medical progress, you should just go ahead and take every &quot;vaccine&quot; from BIG PHARMA and believe you are being protected by its products.  and why not also wear an N95 mask that cannot filter viruses, but do so because the STATE and its sponsors say it&#39;s &quot;safe &amp; effective&quot;, while it both cannot filter viruses (according to the manufacturer, 3M) and deprives you of oxygen that your brain needs, AND causes CO2 poisoning.  the most reasonable question is how anyone would consider it &quot;safe&quot; to put ANY such drug or other material into our public water systems without being able to control dose.  you also conveniently forgot to include the fact that many products which use public water for the products ALSO adds to one&#39;s regular fluoride intake.  you have much more research to do, especially if you believe the official narratives of the CDC, AMA, and FDA.  next you&#39;ll be promoting the use of sugar substitutes because the STATE says they&#39;re &quot;safe &amp; effective&quot;! 🤣🤣🤣  you are certainly not someone to be trusted in these matters, especially if you&#39;re going to cite Alex Jones as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; nutball as does the very FAKE MSM.  no, Jones isn&#39;t always accurate, but MSM &quot;news&quot; networks is almost NEVER accurate.  do you also believe the lie that &quot;America&quot; has been a Capitalist nation, while there no real free markets in existence whatsoever???

 One cannot talk about water fluoridation excluding its chlorination.

 Some of your arguments and comparisons are numerically meaningless.

 I think you miss a scientific point. Yes, nuts say wrong and extreme things. But quoting 1940s and 1950s beliefs and science can miss 2022 thoughts. It IS an element that is poisonous. Like iron and males giving blood monthly is associated with living longer. Also, a trickle of this poison over a lifetime is cumulative. Also, making the bones more prone to osteoporosis in old age is not good. Breaking bones in old age leads to pneumonia 6-18 months later and the death certificate does not note that it was the broken bone. Fluoridation DOES help the teeth. But treating the symptom is error. Before sugar, anthropologists note that skulls have good teeth. Sugar and refined carbs should be reduced, not treating a symptom with a known poison. Thank you.

 What about this saying fluoride added to water. Our water where I live naturally has it in the water. Dentist usually don’t  or shoulnt do fluoride treatments here. Too much fluoride causes moddling. White spots. But it naturally occurred in a lot of places. Actually most minerals in tap water are better for us than supplements or prescribed meds, and definitely better than all the different, supposedly better, store bought water. But as usual the government fear people freaked out over usual bogus junk science or models. It’s honestly ridiculous. Yes some of the things like fluoride, things that are naturally occurring, can be bad, but a person would have to literally drinks gallons a day to maybe have issues from it.

 Growing up in the 60s and 70s tooth decay was common for all of us kids.

 I usually agree with what you say, but seatbelts and airbags can NOT be compared to each other.  Wear a seatbelt if you want to survive a serious crash.  If you want your face ripped open because you hit a bump too hard, then make sure you&#39;re in a car with airbags.  You should ALWAYS use your seatbelt no matter what, but airbags should be illegal.  They have caused many times more injuries than they have prevented.  I&#39;m not saying they haven&#39;t helped in a few cases, but overall you are much better off with just a seatbelt and NO airbag.  Too many of my friends have been seriously injured by airbags in very minor accidents where they wouldn&#39;t have otherwise had a scratch or bruise anywhere.  I will never understand how airbags were allowed to become standard equipment in cars, but I would pay more for a car without them.

Seat belts and air bags work together to provide the best protection for you and your unborn child.&quot;<br><br>Now, on regard of air bag page:<br><br>&quot;Because air bags deploy very rapidly, serious or sometimes fatal injuries can occur if the driver or passenger is too close to - or comes in direct contact with - the air bags when it first deploy.&quot;<br><br>On-off switch air bags:<br><br>&quot;There are few circumstances under which the risk of sitting in front of an active air bag outweigh the safety benefits. Under these circumstances, NHTSA will authorize the installation of an air bag ON-OFF switch. Authorization will be granted under the following circumstances:&quot;<br><br>1 - a rear-facing infant restraint must be placed in the front seat of a vehicle because there is no rear seat or the rear seat is too small for the child restraint.<br>2 - a child under 13 years of age must ride in the front seat because the child has a condition that requires medical monitoring in the front seat.<br>3 - an individual with a medical condition is safer if the air bag is turned off. A written statement must acompany each requedt based on the medical condition unless the request is based on a medical condition which the National Conference on medical indications for air baf deactivation reccomends deactivation.<br>4 - a driver must sit within a few inches of the air bag, typically because she or he is of extremely small stature (4 feet 6 inches or less).<br><br>Personal notes:<br>While indeed air bags are design for extra protection and are effective at their job when paired correctly with the seat belt, they must be used in said combination to avoid injuries both minor and severe, there are potential concern of fatal injuries when drivers do not follow said rules due to the necessary violent nature of the air bag. However, it is undeniable that when used accordingly to the guidelines, air bags add a much needed additional protection for the safety of the driver and the passenger, with only minor cases where such a protection would be considered undesirable, according to the examples presented before.<br><br>In sum, while indeed potentially dangerous when used incorrectly, when under the appropriated usage, it is one potent protection.<br><br>&quot;From 1987 to 2017, frontal air bags saved 50,457 lives.

 You mean to tell me that we put an additive to something everyone drinks all the time, to protect our teeth? You could see why someone might be skeptical. I mean, what other ailments endemic to human populations could be prevented by adding something to the water? Could we put appetite suppressants in the water to deal with the obesity and heart disease epidemic? Maybe we could put an antifungal in the water so we don&#39;t have to deal with athletes foot anymore? What if we add some vitamins and protein to the water to make sure children are able to grow up strong and healthy? Ahh I got it can we add antidepressants to the water to make everyone happy? Why teeth? And why not just sell or give away fluoride powder for people to put in their own water if they want. Good ideas don&#39;t need to be forced down peoples throats.

 Dave I see you are responding to comments so I&#39;m hoping you see this one. First I&#39;d like to say I really enjoyed your flat earth related videos. I&#39;m not a flat earther myself, nor ever have been I just thought they were informative and a treat to watch. That being said I have in the past been skeptical/concerned about the need for fluoride to be in the water supply. However that concern has only ever been that, a passing concern. I have always drank and still drink tap water on a daily basis. That being said I was excited to see this video as I thought it would no doubt put my mind at ease about the issue. However coming to the end of the video I only find myself more concerned. There are several things I would like you to acknowledge/address.<br><br>The foundation of almost all fluoride related studies and research was  a (1940s?) experiment in Grand rapids Michigan where they added an unknown amount of fluoride to the water supply of this guinea pig city. The evidence showed that over the span of 11 years it was clear that there was an improvement in the amount cavities/tooth decay observed in children. I cannot find any numeric amount to this improvement but it leads me to my first major point of concern.<br><br>#1:<br>Could this study not be flawed? You say in your video that studies and research done on fluoride relating to IQ were &quot;of poor quality&quot; &quot;limited&quot; &quot;shaky&quot;, &quot;things weren&#39;t controlled for&quot;, (all totally valid concerns). Why don&#39;t you apply the same standard to the research done in the 1940s? Don&#39;t you think there were things that they didn&#39;t control for? Possibly the fact that during that same time toothbrushing was becoming much more common in the United states, so maybe that had an effect on children developing cavities? Again, I don&#39;t know how significant the findings were OR if they were significant enough to force the adoption of these measures all across America. It would be great if there was something like &quot;~30% decrease in cavities in children was observed&quot;. I can&#39;t find anything like that, maybe you can help.<br><br>#2:<br>How exactly does fluoride aid in the remineralization of tooth enamel? And where do you get the fact that it remineralizes at (roughly) the same frequency that it mineralizes? Using what metrics? Referring to what study/research? In your flat earth videos you would go out of your way to prove beyond a sane doubt that what you were saying was true. You don&#39;t really do that in this instance.<br><br>#3:<br>It is argued in the video that systemic ingestion of fluoride also helps along with topical. And that is why, to the dismay of conspiracy theorists, it is in the water. However, in the first study you list in the description I find an alarming statement: &quot;The level of fluoride incorporated into dental mineral by systemic ingestion is insufficient to play a significant role in caries prevention.&quot; This statement kinda blows apart the systemic ingestion narrative so I&#39;m hoping you can help here.<br><br>omission<br><br>As of right now my opinion: there is not enough sufficient scientific evidence supporting positive effects that outweigh any potential negative effects(short or long term) to allow the forced adoption of ingested fluoride for citizens who wish to use public water. do you disagree?

 Personally, I love water! I love MY water! I live out in the country with a really big mountain in front of me. My well is 325&#39; (feet that is) deep and my well has tapped in to an underground river that flows through the mountain. The water is pure and probably the best tasting water I have ever had. I have been drinking this water for over 30 years now and because of that I will NOT drink city water. My teeth are fine, even at my age I have all but one that got knocked out when I was about 50 years old, there is not even a good story behind it, just me being stupid. They put so much shit in the city water I can&#39;t drink it. I can smell the chlorine as soon as the water comes out of the spigot!! As for fluoride, I get enough of that I guess, brushing my teeth. It is what the city does to the water I don&#39;t like. Maybe water just wasn&#39;t meant to be messed with. Living creatures all over the world swear by it!

 The only worry I ever even thought about Fluoride in water. Was just how much the Aluminum industries lobbied for it. They were the main drivers of the idea and not the Dentists. And since it was not hard back then to falsify research then convince many Doctors to back it up, just check out the Tabacco industry. Plus the huge amount of industrial waste that was building up at the time from the Aluminum processing. Then suddenly there is a way to not have to pay to get rid of the waste but now they get paid by the government to pure it in the water is alittle too convenient. But I guess time has proven it was not that bad of solution.

 I love this video, but I want to comment on one thing.  Berkey filtration is not a scam despite being shown here nor does it even filter out fluoride from the water.

But their main thing is filtering out bacteria and viruses, and it&#39;s been shown that they are actually quite awesome when it comes to that.

 Fun Fact: The Mormon prophet Ezra Taft Benson, who served under Eisenhower, spread the fluoride conspiracy, preached it, and wrote on it for 50 years. Fluoride, the civil rights movement (particularly Dr. King), and environmentalists (especially the women) were all agents of a Satanic communist plot to take over the US. With Fluoride specifically as a mind control agent. Rich irony coming from the leader who mind controlled his people. He was a close associate with the John Birch Society, and tried to get &quot;The Church&quot; to officially embrace the Birchers and their views. And yeah, you guessed it! He was also &quot;close&quot; to J Edgar Hoover! Around 77, after the rumors of Hoover&#39;s peccadillos came out, EZT &quot;Bore his Testimony&quot; at BYU about Hoover, saying that through innuendo, lesser men with questionable motives, were trying to malign his character.

 One thing you missed about recommendations to not swallow toothpaste is that there are other ingredients in toothpaste besides fluoride that could be harmful if one ingests a large amount, including sodium dodecyl sulfate, the same anionic detergent used in shampoos and other liquid detergents--at the very least that would give you one hell of a belly ache.

 What about the environmental concerns?  One thing I&#39;ve heard is that the government will award private contracts to provide water fluoridation to companies which produce chemical waste that has a high (but not pure) concentration of fluoride, essentially paying them to dump their waste in or near water supplies, wreaking havoc with the local flora and fauna.  <br><br>I believe this is the actual origin of the &quot;turning the frogs gay&quot; meme - one company that was doing this was found to be dumping waste that contained atrazine, a chemical which a study showed caused amphibians to spontaneously change genders when exposed to it, and the prevalence of the chemical in water fluoridation sources could potentially be linked to dwindling frog populations.

Fluorine is in the top right corner of the periodic table and it is the most electronegative element. Exact opposite of a metal.<br>Next, think back to general biology.

So you see all that matters is the chemical (molecular) make up. Shape/chemistry matters. Source does not matter. In any situation where the body absorbs a nutrient better from a food than from a supplement, this is for a chemical reason.

 This one is something I have never heard anybody discuss, doubt, criticize or in any other way show any kind of healthy skepticism:<br><br>I think most people have heard the spiel, in one form or another: You must drink such-and-such amount of water every day. People drink too little water and get &quot;dehydrated&quot;. If you ever feel thirsty, it&#39;s too late: You are already dehydrated. Dehydration, dehydration, dehydration.<br><br>Dehydration schmehydration. Have you ever heard of the supposed negative side effects of not drinking &quot;enough&quot; water. Of becoming &quot;dehydrated&quot;, which you already are if you feel thirsty? Because I haven&#39;t. I have only heard the spiel, in several forms, numerous times, but I have never heard what exactly is it supposed to prevent.<br><br>The main reason why I think this is mostly a BS claim is that humanity lived millions of years before all this &quot;you must drink at least such-and-such amount of water every day, else it&#39;s very bad&quot; thing. Have you ever heard of any sort of common ailment that plagued humanity before we found out about this water thing?

However, this is not a condition that normal people suffer in their normal everyday lives even if they aren&#39;t constantly drinking water.<br><br>One could ask &quot;what&#39;s the harm?&quot; Even if this wisdom is false, there&#39;s no harm in it. Indeed, luckily drinking excess water, in moderation, isn&#39;t very dangerous, and in fact can have some slight benefits. However, there&#39;s another indirect way in which this claim can be harmful. More particularly, it&#39;s harmful to the environment.<br><br>You see, people, especially in some countries, have been so inculcated with this belief that they will always carry with them water bottles.

 We don&#39;t drink flouridated tap water in my house only because our local water utility has a bad habit of the sewage pipes bursting and we end up having boil water warnings almost every other week. They also have a bad habit of not always announcing to the public when the water is contaminated. The last time we regularly used tap water, we were having chronic intestinal issues and the only thing we could think of causing it was the water as stomach upset would happen not long after drinking. We finally called the local water utility and found out they had, once again, neglected to make a public announcement that the water had been contaminated. We now have a water cooler and refill two five gallon jugs of water every other week at $1.50/five gallons.

 I drink a ton of water (other than black coffee it is all I drink) and I use a reverse osmosis filtration system I installed user my kitchen sink. Not because of fluoride but because the tap water in my area tastes terrible and because I am concerned about the possibility of heavy metals and other such contamination that could occur due to unscrupulous officials and industries (fracking is a big thing in Pennsylvania).

 No one is eating 1 liter of tooth paste, most people are using less than 1 gram of toothpaste per brushing. Therefore, if I eat 1 gram of toothpaste, that is the same fluoride as drinking 2 liters of water. Claiming water is safe because it has less parts per million is misleading because a typical human drinks 2000 to 8000 times as much water as they consume toothpaste (by volume). <br>Your video would suggest that 2 grams is not toxic, only that entire tubes would be. I just felt it should be noted that with respect to topic #3 you cannot state densities in a vacuum and have it mean anything, you have to be aware of the volumes consumed.

 The thing is, this would be way more believable if fluoride in water would be more common than it is, only 25 countries do it and in 11 of them less than 20% of the population actually consume it. If it only had upsides and EVERYTHING is known about longterm use, why is it not implemented on more first world countries?<br><br>I have no idea if such studies exist that examine longterm fluoride consumption through drinking water namely because i live in a country which does not add it so i have no reason to look for it but i also would be heavily sceptical about adding something to drinking water that i could get with regular hygene, im not saying its bad but that so little amount of countries are doing it when apparently it has been known for a long time that it is good for you makes me question if those countries that use it have truly looked if there are longterm issues.<br><br>basically i dont know but i am not a fan of putting something in our drinking water that could be gotten through other means.

That doesn&#39;t fit well with the notion being objective &amp; fair.<br>I know plenty of anti-fluoride people. In most cases, it is due to a:<br><br>(A) lack of trust in Authorities like the FDA. Scientific process &amp; esp the politics of the FDA does mean trusting the process is free ENOUGH of commercial interference &amp; egos of scientists, unless you are an expert in all the tiny details, which I&#39;m not, or you trust someone else who says they have.

Say what you want about that, it but it is very different from the personal attacks &amp; sneering attiude of Dave in this video.<br>(C) Concern about too much flouride. This video didn&#39;t address how much is too much, if you brush x2 daily and drink 6 liters a day (so 6 or so mg per day + in toothpaste). Dave didn&#39;t even mention the maximum or recommended daily intake, which is odd.<br><br>(2) constant seering personal attacks of his advesaries &amp; (3) &quot;guilt by association&quot; of Scientists is unprofessional and gives the impression he has a things emotionally at stake on this, and thus comits the other points i made.<br>It also a is a constant attack on anyone who has any scepticism at all, so an anti-science attiude.

 I appreciate how you don&#39;t insult people who believe these things, admit that questioning it is perfectly OK, and admit when there is logic to certain lines of questioning.  However, anyone who speaks about the dangers of Fluoride in water you assume they are acting in bad faith... why is that?  Why assume malevolence?  Isn&#39;t it entirely possible that the overwhelming majority of them actually believe what they say they do?  <br><br>Typically, when you ask a question like this, you get two reactions from people.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe simply ridicules the person asking and doesn&#39;t have their questions answered.  Anyone who does shares the information they have... even if it might be inaccurate, incomplete, or missing the big picture.  So from the perspective of someone asking a question, which do you think they would be more likely to believe?  This seems obvious, and probably why you take this approach; it is MUCH more effective.  Videos like this are the exception and most people will not find them.  <br><br>However, couldn&#39;t the same be said about anyone who talks about it publicly and tries to warn others of what they perceive as a danger?  The key difference between someone asking the question, and someone who talks about it publicly, is the latter got information from those who already believed... there is not much at all separating them.  As for a researcher, unless they can be shown to be purposefully disingenuous, is likely going off of the available information they had and is taking a huge risk to their career to do so.  Anyone in this latter category has even more to lose if they later admit they were wrong... so wouldn&#39;t this same approach be even more useful?  <br><br>I feel in general, with any of these sorts of topics, we do a disservice when we insult and belittle people... there is nothing wrong with asking any question and trying to learn about any topic, no matter where that takes you.  If people would simply be kinder, and help people to find good information, a lot of this could be avoided.  We also put far too much emphasis on shaming people when they are wrong... if you are not finding yourself wrong about something you are NOT learning and growing.  It&#39;s like a competition where no one wins.  <br><br>Look at the state of &quot;debate&quot; we have now... even the most &quot;civil&quot; is a performance with no substance.  I believe the best thing we can do to combat this is to stop acting like someone is &quot;owned&quot; when they are proven wrong... EVERYONE is wrong about something!  It should be celebrated when someone is found to be proven wrong, and has the courage to admit it.  It is the only way to grow, and we stagnate under the weight of our egos.  A humble fool will eventually stumble across the truth, while an arrogant intellectual will never take the first step of that journey. 

 	Replies: ['naejimba', '@Professor Dave Explains &quot;The people who create the propaganda are.&quot;  To be fair, that is an assumption.  Again, isn&#39;t it entirely possible these people believe what they say they do?  I was raised religious but am now an Atheist.  I&#39;m reminded of religious fundamentalists who try to convert others... I believe they are completely wrong, and have no solid case to make.  However, I can also acknowledge that they believe what they say they do, and that (from their perspective) they are trying to help others.  For all of their faults it is out of concern for others that they act.  <br><br>Now, if you&#39;ve ever tried to interact with people like this, note the reaction you get if someone claims that they are acting in bad faith and actively trying to deceive others.  You get NOWHERE and they immediately become defensive (they might even claim the person they are talking to is possessed or deceived by the devil; the conspiracy theorist equivalent of being brainwashed or working for some government agency).  It is the end of any productive discussion.  I&#39;ve found a much better approach is to first let them know you think they are being genuine, and thank them for their concern for others.  As strange as it sounds, first making that human connection with them makes all of the difference.  Typically that would be the end of the first conversation, and I just let them know that I&#39;m passionate about the truth and helping others, but that I disagree and am not looking to argue with them... and if they&#39;d like, at some point we can talk about it because I believe these views do cause some very real harm.  Then I shake their hand or hug their neck.  <br><br>You would be surprised at how many people are willing to sit down at a later time after processing this.  At the very least, they will be willing to hear you out, and are exposed to a new point of view and arguments they otherwise would not be.  It&#39;s about planting a seed and making it so THEY want to dive deeper on their own, at their own pace.  I don&#39;t think someone has EVER changed another person&#39;s mind... but people change their own minds every day.

 Modern science indicates that ingested fluoride, neither a nutrient nor essential, is ineffective at reducing tooth decay and harmful to health, especially to baby&#39;s developing brain.

 Highly informative video, reveals historical data that even I, aged as I am, did not know. The fact that people in Grand Rapids way back in 1945 were complaining that their teeth were falling out due to water that had not yet been fluoridated  says a lot about the kind of collective paranoia behind most conspiracy theories. Pure bedlam is unleashed. It also reveals how difficult it is to debunk groundless conspiracy theories. When rumors, hearsay and folk tales suffice to convince many people of the &#39;reality&#39; of a conspiracy, real evidence is thrown out the window. <br><br>I&#39;m glad the video mentioned Dr. Strangelove, a timeless classic that shows the audience in hilarious fashion, the irrationality of the paranoid mind. Kubrick understood very well the dangers of runaway conspiracy theories, it makes for an extremely paranoid mindset and paranoia does not lead to rational decision making. It can lead to pointless and highly destructive wars that humanity may never recover from.  I&#39;m glad to see that younger people today still watch this landmark movie.

 If adding fluoride to the drinking water is for medical purposes, don&#39;t people have the right to choose whether or not to be medicated? There are dozens of medications that could be applied to the average person that could improve their lives even just slightly. From mental and physical health, to fitness, energy, anything and everything you could think of. Caffeine, though addictive, doesn&#39;t really have any negative effects. Why not artificially add Caffeine to the water supply to boost productivity?<br><br>At the end of the day, it&#39;s about whether or not you believe you have the right to force something on someone. Even if they have the reasonable means to work around that something. Even if they don&#39;t care. Even if they want it. Do you have the right to say &quot;You will do X&quot; to an individual? What gives you that right? How would a violation of that right be compensated? <br><br>Fluoride does have medical benefits. Of course it does. However, so does walking. We don&#39;t force people to walk just so they can get in their daily exercise. Why would we force a medication, then? 

 	Replies: ['Galileo G', '@Some Guy I did not answer some (or most) of your questions because, frankly, I do not understand your points. The Kulaks? We were talking about water fluoridation…. However, I did not insult anyone, neither you nor your country. I simply remarked that I have met many people in the US who speak like you, and I found rational discussions impossible with them. I think the reason is that I approach the problem of civility from the standpoint of a society, whereas many Americans are only concerned about their “individual freedoms”, revealing a frontier mentality no longer justified by the presence of any discernible frontier. These are ways of thinking which are deeply rooted in your culture and education, and become extremely dangerous when applied to foreign policy without any attempt to actually understand foreigners. The frontier in Europe has disappeared centuries ago, we have fought each other for millennia and we are now concerned with good communal life. When I talk about this in the US, the question from the other side is always the same: “Are you a socialist?”. And this dumb label ends any possibility of a constructive discussion, as it does with you, although you go a lot farther by comparing me to Mussolini or Stalin (forgot Hitler?). This is what I was trying to explain to you. I just do not understand you: I lived in the US quite well for a long time, so the US was not a bad country to me. Ultimately though, there are a lot of people like you in it, people I perceive as undesirable to live with, and in Europe I find myself surrounded by people with whom I do not always agree, but who share with me a common education, culture, values. That is all. Don’t get offended if I say I do not like you. I just cannot follow your reasoning, and everything you seem to hold dear is meaningless to me. I am a slave, you say. Let me make an example: a doctor is a slave in a society where affordable (or free) health care. Why? People are free to choose their occupation, free to open a business, and then, being doctors, they try to help people get better, which I assume is the goal of the medical profession. They are compensated for their services, and whether the patient pays or an insurance scheme pays (indirectly with taxpayer money) makes no difference to a doctor. Where does slavery come in? The doctor can make his own hours, his own rates, can refuse to treat patients when he is too busy, earns good money and can take vacations when he wants. If it is slavery, then slavery is not so bad, and for me beats living in the woods, in a wooden shack full of weapons to protect oneself from the government.', 'Some Guy', '@Galileo G <br>Yes, forcing people to perform a laborious task is literally the definition of slavery. You don&#39;t need whips and cotton fields for enslavement to occur. Simply telling someone that you are entitled to their labor, and then backing that entitlement up with governmental enforcement, is enough to justify calling doctors, nurses, and other medical staff &quot;Slaves,&quot; in some European countries. <br><br>You ignored what I said about the Kulaks. I find that interesting. A lack of response in any debate is the same as agreeing, or at the very least giving ground.<br><br>You didn&#39;t deny being a socialist, which is an immoral ideology. <br><br>Let&#39;s talk about the difference between a duty and a right, and maybe throw in some understanding about privileges too. <br><br>In America, voting is not a right. (It gets complicated with men Vs. women, but we&#39;ll just pretend that women share the same civic responsibility as men). Voting is a privilege given to those who sign up for the selective service. Voting also comes with the understanding of other civic responsibilities, such as Jury Duty. In America no one has the overt right to vote. You cannot vote without first giving up some form of freedom, whether that be the freedom to decide your career path or the freedom of how to spend your Thursday afternoon. <br><br>Civic duties are typically things we must do to earn said privileges. Like I said earlier, Selective Service, Jury Duty, paying property tax, etc. These are all duties that enable you to enjoy a privilege.<br><br>I have no obligation to speak to the police. I cannot be forced to, in fact. There is no civic duty that can compel me to speak with any member of the Government. That right is laid out in the fifth amendment.<br><br>You also seem to misunderstand what the US Constitution is. It does not give me my rights. It spells them out to the government. It isn&#39;t to let me know what my rights are, but to remind the government where it can and cannot tread.<br><br>Finally, you didn&#39;t really say anything about how I don&#39;t have an obligation to be nice to the greater society, again giving ground and distracting by saying I should live in the forest. You also seem to enjoy telling me how my country should be run. You yourself have admitted to being European, and said that you never felt kinship with America, nor her Culture. That&#39;s your problem. You insult my people, my country, my person, my culture, and my very way of life. Then you have the audacity to tell me how it should be run. How I should live. You tell me you don&#39;t understand the American people, then tell me you know how they should be medicated? What a horrifying ego. I couldn&#39;t possibly imagine someone more similar to Stalin or Mussolini.', 'Galileo G', '@Some Guy So the fundamental rights are those you have in a forest, all the rest is tyranny. But I suppose you do not live in a forest, so you take advantage of the convenience of an organized society, of a social contract, yet you want no obligations. Mind boggling. If you think advocating health care for all is enslavement and genocide (?) you do not belong in a civilized society. Then go live in the forest.', 'Some Guy', '@Galileo G <br>Ah. You don&#39;t understand the difference between negative and positive rights. And you&#39;re a socialist. Got ya. <br><br>Negative rights are rights that you have via the inaction of others. The only way they can be violated is by the action of others. So, the right to own firearms is a negative right. People need to physically take your weapons to violate your right to own firearms. Speaking freely is a negative right. People need to actively silence you. <br><br>Healthcare and education are positive rights. They&#39;re rights that you can only have through the actions of another. To have the right to healthcare, you need to violate the rights of medical professionals. To have the right to education, you need to violate the rights of teachers. Doctors and teachers can&#39;t deny you services, and thus choose who to serve, if it&#39;s you&#39;re right to have them. These rights enslave specific classes of people, and thus hurt society. Same with the right to food. It&#39;s the enslavement of farmers. If you disagree, ask the Kulaks how the Soviets felt about the right to food. <br><br>Take a man, place him in the forest, and you will quickly find what his fundamental rights really are. He is secured in his possessions, able to make and hold weapons, he may say what he wants when he wants, and he can defend himself from nature and others. If his leg breaks there is no doctor that will appear to heal it. If he has a question about an algae or mushroom there is no teacher who will appear to educate him.<br><br>Moving on to &quot;Democratic civilized society.&quot; Democracy is tyranny. That is all. <br><br>Social Darwinism is also tyranny. <br><br>Again, you sit there and tell me that I&#39;m wrong while advocating for slavery and genocide. Not directly, but through the enforcement of government action against people. I&#39;m sure you support the Dutch government&#39;s actions against their farmers, much like I&#39;m sure you supported the Soviets in their actions against those naughty Kulaks. How dare they think they have the right to their own personal property, the right to barter for the worth of their goods, and the right to feed themselves above others. Right? <br><br>Again, you take a moral argument and apply it to a non-moral issue, only to show your immorality. Worse, your ignorance of some of the most basic philosophical understandings of what is and is not a right. You do not know, so you demand to get what you want. Like a child. <br><br>See? I can insult you too.', 'Galileo G', '@Some Guy There are very few really “fundamental rights” for mankind. What many Americans call their “fundamental rights”, like carrying weapons or not wearing a mask when requested, are simple whims, allegedly justified by a personal interpretation of some outdated documents. Here in Europe the majority of people consider the right to a free (or affordable) education and free healthcare as the main “fundamental rights” of mankind, at least in a democratic civilized society, yet the majority in the US would not accept this definition, and indeed these are things you do not have. It is just up to the social contract of a specific state, and it is not up to any sacred principle, to decide what one’s rights are, because nothing is fundamental. You can rally in support of non-fluoridated water, it is your right, but there is no fundamental violation of your “fundamental rights” in fluoridating your water. How can you not understand this? How can you not understand that a social contract comes with BOTH rights and duties? By not focusing on social duties, you seem not to understand how a modern democratic society MUST function. I lived in the US for a long time, but I never felt like an American, the reason being that the average American, of which you seem to be the stereotype, is basically a self-centered, aggressive social Darwinist with whom I never felt any affinity.']

 This is contrary to my previous &quot;research&quot;, but I believe him. I didn&#39;t know the fluoride conspiracy coincided with the anti-vaxxer crowd. Anyway, I know this is just my own anecdotal evidence, but since my &quot;research&quot; 5 years ago I have been drinking reverse osmosis water and using non-fluoridated toothpaste. Since then, I&#39;ve only been to the dentist twice for cleaning (no cavities) and no longer have sensitive teeth (I used to go a lot with lots of cavities and had very sensitive teeth).  I will add that I have been great at brushing my teeth since then as well and brush my teeth for at least 2 minutes every night which no doubt plays a key role.  So, I am not saying at all that removing fluoride from your regime will help your teeth, but I am saying that fluoride is absolutely unnecessary in drinking water and in toothpaste (at least from my own personal experience). Brushing your teeth consistently for at least 2 minutes a night I would say is far more important.  So, take of it what you will, but I will still choose to be fluoride free, and I recommend trying it out.  I promise, your teeth won&#39;t fall out and your enamel won&#39;t peel off :)

Effects observed in animals include changes in organ weight, morphological changes in tissues, increased mitotic activity, decreased concentrations of pituitary hormones, depressed glucose utilization, elevated serum glucose, and elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Effects reported in humans include “endocrine disturbances,” impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated concentrations of pituitary hormones. Studies of the effects of fluoride on glucose metabolism and in diabetic animals are discussed below; information on other effects is extremely limited.<br><br>Fluoride exposure in humans is associated with elevated TSH concentrations, increased goiter prevalence, and altered T4 and T3 concentrations; similar effects on T4 and T3 are reported in experimental animals, but TSH has not been measured in most studies.

 Look.  Brush your teeth.  Swish with a fluoride solution if you want more treatment.<br><br>At the bottom of all the arguments, there is equally no basis for putting it in the water as everything that is described as an ailment is either very special case or the base issues are always linked back to poverty causing bad habits and nutritional deficits which fluoridated water somehow cures - that&#39;s literally the last stand argument of every single person voting to add impurities and cost to the public water system.  It&#39;s also MY water system too, so maybe government funded fluoridation units at the end point, right in with your water purifiers if you want to have it in your water all the time no matter what.<br><br>The only thing that&#39;s in our water is some chlorine which outgasses/evaporates off overnight if you don&#39;t like it but is less chlorine in a year exposure than you get in a day at a public pool, both internal and external.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that with proper nutrition and hygiene, you&#39;ll keep your adult teeth till you die.  Unless you have a medical condition, then treatments and remedies are necessary.<br><br>But we don&#39;t all need them, and I don&#39;t really want to pay extra in my property tax to have it implemented in a public utility and maintained indefinitely.  it seems like there are many more less costly, safer overall, simpler, and completely accessible options for those who need it.  Use my taxes to implement accessibility to oral/dental care and supplies as well as dental/orthodontic support for the at risk in the population - it was going to cost $35M year USD to maintain the program here and who knows what actual setup costs because our city is gravity fed from mountain range freshwater protected aquifers, there aren&#39;t even any pumps on the pipeline until it gets to local distribution.

 I have a question not specifically related to this but I’ve recently learned of a conspiracy that the government is paying farmers to destroy their crops to cause a good famine under the guise of “it’s to lower CO2 levels.”<br><br>Whether or not this is true I don’t really care but the fact that destroying crops is to lower CO2 seems impossibly wrong, plants produce oxygen and how could CO2 lower by destroying specifically crops when CO2 is produced by things such as burning fuel. <br><br>I only ask this because I figure you or someone here can give me a scientific explanation that either proves or disproves this and because I want a valid argument for the next time I come across this conspiracy because I’m getting sick of hearing conspiracies where I live.

 Fluoridation is likely the main reason I still have teeth. From the time I was 20 till about 30 I did not brush at all. I then decided &quot;you know, I should really brush, don&#39;t want to lose my teeth&quot;. I have always been a big water drinker, averaging between 1-2 gallons a day. So now I brush at least once a day and still drink nearly 2 gallons of water a day. Odd thing is, my family members that are most against Fluoridation are also the ones with bad teeth.

 The reason not to swallow toothpaste is not because of the fluparide, but because of the diatomaceous earth often added as a polishing agent. Diatomaceous earth is often used as a physical insecticide, because diatoms have silica &quot;shells&quot; that, when crushed, are more or less like microscopic glass shards. They are great for scraping tartar off teeth, but are not recommended for swallowing for obvious reasons.

I was advised to find a brand of vegan toothpaste which is &#39;full of chemicals&#39;. I found one which fitted the bill - and it was about 75% cheaper than its &#39;all natural, snake oil counter part&#39;. My teeth are back in good health and mostly everything else I kept constant so I am chalking it up to chemicals being &#39;good for teeth&#39; :)

 Hey Dave I’m a big fan of your videos and I just have a question. In your video you mentioned hypocalcemia (hopefully I spelt that right) as a effect of toddlers eating excessive amounts of tooth paste, but then you refer to the calcification of the pineal gland as a non starter because calcium ≠ fluoride. Based on what you said in the video levels of calcium in the blood could be impacted by fluoride intake, what’s happening to this calcium? I apologize if I come across as rude as I don’t mean to. I have been drinking fluoridated water all my life and have recently become worried about because of various figures online. A response would be much appreciated, thanks.

 I emigrated from the US to the Czech Republic several years ago, and I just assumed everyone fluoridated their water everywhere. After watching this video, I looked it up and it seems that Czechia stopped fluoridating water in 2008. (We certainly use fluoride toothpaste, though). From what I&#39;m reading, it appears that European countries rely on their robust health sectors to provide fluoridation as medicinally necessary, and don&#39;t consider using it preventatively in the water supply at large to be a necessity. This approach has seem similar if not identical results in the decline of tooth decay in the general population as fluoridation has in the US and elsewhere. (There does appear to be genuine debate on this topic amongst experts, however.)<br><br>Every day is indeed a school day. 

 	Replies: ['Joshua Pray', '@Emily Firman I don&#39;t think necessary ubiquitousness or political pressure is the reason so much of Europe chooses not to fluoridate the water supply. European countries have serious and highly accessible healthcare systems (something the United States lacks). Therefore, if fluoride is necessary in an individual&#39;s diet or other fluoride protocols are necessary in order to halt or prevent tooth decay in that individual, then doctors are free (or mostly free) and available to provide this information and medication as soon as it is needed.<br><br>And as I mentioned above, studies conducted on the continent have shown that this difference in approach (automatic preventative measures in the water supply or needs medicinally provided for) has had little or no difference in result in citizens&#39; oral health. So no pressure needed; this is simply what works in Europe while it might not in the States (because it could very possibly be cost-prohibitive for much of the population).', 'Emily Firman', 'Some folks decide against using the optimal public health tools due to political pressure, some countries have it naturally in their water supplies, some water systems are so complicated it makes sense to use salt or other methods - Europe is a tapestry of regulation and water fluoridation works best when it is ubiquitous']

 I know this isn&#39;t about fluoride. But it deals with misinformation and people just believing what someone tells them or what they read w/o checking the facts. I was talking to a guy that I hadn&#39;t seen in maybe 5 years. But the conversation came up about getting the vaccine. First thing out of his mouth was &quot;Well, I&#39;m not gettń tha shot cawse it has baby fetus in the vaccine. And metallic substances that mixes wit yore iron in your blood and crates this mini electric charge that when they amp up the 5g. It&#39;s gonna make you have blackouts like you doo when ya drunk. It&#39;s all right hare on this facebook post frum my girlfriends pastors page.&quot; Of course my face was like 🤨.........🤔.......🤭.....☺.....🤣 and I went through a few of @Professor Dave uploads on vaccines, also @Sci Man Dan and his info on the vaccine. I even showed him where you guys got your information. And believe it or not, the dude was like &quot;Hell I just figred a pastor wasn&#39;t gonna feed no line of bullshit to the people. Why would a christian do that?&quot; I simply said &quot;There ain&#39;t enough time to show you all the harm religion has done over thousands of years. Just trust me when I say that religion is the biggest con or manipulative system ever created by human beings. (I know that isn&#39;t exactly the case but...🤷‍♂️) I got a kick outta the last thing he said though &quot;I never really understood the bible no how. I would read some of it. And when it&#39;s all thou, art, cometh, whatevereth the fucketh. Never made sense.&quot; Next time I see him I plan on having some scriptures for him to let soak in. Which dude is a redneck through and through. Well, I am too. But the difference is he is racist, and not affraid to sling the N word like saying Nike. Something this ol&#39; redneck don&#39;t listen to or want to deal with. So I know what he will say when I mention Exodus 21 and beyond.  Anyway, I apologize for being off the topic of this video.

I&#39;ve heard it a few times in relation to fluoride and wondered what their deal was.', 'Thomas Neal', 'the idea is that the pineal gland tends to concentrate fluoride ions (no evidence that it does, and ionic fluorine would cause damage if not eliminated), and that since uncombined fluorine ions (or weakly combined?) would attract Calcium ions, you would get crystalized calcium fluoride forming.  but here are the problems with that:<br><br>1.  as mentioned, Fluorine ions are VERY reactive, and would simply not sit around in a gland waiting for a casual calcium molecule to float on by, they will quickly react with ANYTHING nearby that can donate a proton, which includes most proteins.. so it&#39;s extremely unlikely they will for Calcium ions IN the pineal gland itself.<br>2. Fluorine can also react with another common element:  magnesium.  so it&#39;s almost as likely it would form magnesium fluoride as calcium fluoride randomly, but we see none of this.<br>3. the fact that this is used by people invested in the Astral Planes and Chakra ideas makes the entire hypothesis highly suspect (see Dave&#39;s response, because that&#39;s what he is thinking most likely).<br>4.  there is literally no legitimate data on this hypothesis.  just random musings by pseudoscientists.', 'Professor Dave Explains', 'No, because that&#39;s too stupid to bother addressing.']

 As much as I loved the entirety of this video my favorite part was the end where you mentioned the Fluoride Exposed site. I know of far too many scientists who have been &quot;&quot;&quot;debunked&quot;&quot;&quot;, especially recently, despite their heart and soul being poured into their line of work. A little bit of pure f you needs to be said to these morons claiming to know something they researched online for 5 minutes and decided they were the experts on because of it. It&#39;s like that meme where the caption reads &quot;I am an empath. That means I decide how you feel and then just go with that assumption immediately even if you say you feel different.&quot; Like, no. That&#39;s not how this works. Same with conspiracies. They decide immediately what they want to believe and stick to it. This sort of thought is affecting me personally right now, and it is really pissing me off. Not just Covid but other fields of study. Your channel, though, is a place where I can go to hear about the real science and what people are really studying and I really appreciate that.

 Out of curiosity, I checked my city&#39;s website to see if we had fluoridated water. I was surprised to learn that the city had <i>stopped</i> adding fluoride to city water in 2011, when Republicans came into power. The issue was debated for the next 7 years until eventually the Republicans were voted out and fluoridated water returned in 2018. Fortunately the local water already has 0.5 ppm Fl- naturally, so it was only a deficit of 0.2 ppm to make up. With oral health being linked to more serious diseases like stomach ulcers and heart problems, it&#39;s a LOT more than just a smile that oral hygiene protects!

 I drink bottled water and never drink water out of the tap.<br><br>Most bottled water haters don&#39;t drink water themselves, so they don&#39;t know that there is a taste difference between different types of water. I live in Chicago and the tap water here tastes like it comes from a swimming pool. It&#39;s disgusting. In addition, the water is delivered via LEAD pipes so it&#39;s also dangerous. The city sends us letters in the mail telling us this, but they still have a special tax on bottled water and won&#39;t replace the lead pipes unless you pay them. It&#39;s almost like they want to deliberately poison the residents.<br><br>Of course, not everyone has city water. People with well water might want to drink bottled water due to the bad taste of well water in their area. Some well water I&#39;ve tasted is good, others were awful. It depends on where you live. Additionally, in rural areas there are dangers from pesticides used in farming getting into the water supply. Also there are supposed to be some dangers from fracking polluting the water supply.<br><br>As for flouride, well, I think by now we should all know to brush our teeth?? If someone is so stupid as to not brush their teeth then I think they SHOULD get cavities, so they&#39;ll learn their lesson and have to go to the dentist to get the problem fixed. Everyone around them will thank them since they will no longer have to smell their stinky breath! Despite my lack of flouride consumption in water for more than a decade, I still don&#39;t get cavities.

 I’m just genuinely curious and have a question. I heard that fluoride can bind to your bones and make them brittle and more likely to break, is that true? Maybe this would only happen if you ingested large quantities of fluoride? It could make sense as you mentioned in the video too much fluoride can cause low calcium levels in the blood.

 I have dental fluorosis which as you say is well known to be caused by too much fluoride consumption, so would I have reason to be upset that I grew up being unable to avoid fluoridated water as a child? How do we determine how much to limit the amount of water and toothpaste we can give our kids to prevent this? Because this doesn&#39;t seem to be a false claim at all, especially as you acknowledged it rather than debunk it.

 Question: why do you put such a focus on consensus? Isn&#39;t the point of science that knowledge is based on repeatability and factual accuracy?

 I&#39;ve been an opponent of water fluoridation for a while now, and I&#39;ve got a couple questions. Hopefully someone here can set me straight and I can admit that I was wrong and get on with my new life of drinking the peasant water haha.<br><br>It&#39;s my understanding that excess fluoride in the system can cause calcification of soft tissues in the body like veins, arteries, and parts of the brain and heart. Calcification is associated with an array of health issues.<br><br>My main question is: are the claims that fluoride causes the calcification of soft tissues, specifically the pineal gland, false?<br><br>Here&#39;s my psudoscience brain at work: In the tooth example Fluoride replaces the hydroxide to bind to the calcium making a more secure structure. Calcium fluoride (CaF2) is an insoluble salt that forms a crystaline structure that is difficult to break down. Is it crazy to think that adding more fluoride to our system could lead to the unwanted buildup of harmful mineral deposits that we have no way of ridding ourselves of in the future?<br><br>I would love for nothing more than for someone to explain why this is psudoscience!<br><br>Thanks in advance for any answers

It is also worth noting that pineal glands in the study\rby Tharnpanich et al. [53] were collected from deceased persons aged 33 to 91 years (mean 67 years),\rwho had inhabited an area with low fluoride contamination, which is a strong argument for the idea\rthat a smaller or larger accumulation of fluoride in the gland occurs even when the organism is not\rexposed to particularly large amounts of fluorine compounds in the environment.&quot; Applied Sciences article on flouride and pineal calcification', 'Navonila Sinharay', '@Ryan Swartwout  I also checked the Web MD page from which you have quoted the above experiment.

 Funny how you relate this conspiracy theory to the right wing in your country<br>In my country the people I know who support these ideas are mostly far left of the previous generation<br>My aunt, declared communist, says they put these things on water to control us, and making us less aware or concious. Same goes for a friend of my mom, somewhat of a hippie and also communist. she&#39;s the kind of person who goes to courses of Bach Flowers, homeopathy, etc.<br><br>Then two of my close friends who also happen to be communists (please don&#39;t judge them) are nothing like that. There&#39;s no way they&#39;d believe something like that.<br>What&#39;s the difference? it&#39;s a generational difference and also an educational difference. My friends education is science related so I&#39;d say there&#39;s no possibility they&#39;d believe that, but then I remembered there&#39;re some exceptions, as I remembered I had another classmate in university who said she believed in &quot;energies&quot; and many other pseudoscience related stuff in spite of her scientific education.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this conspiracy theory was exported to other countries from the United States, or it&#39;s the other way around, however it&#39;s amazing how it adapts depending on where you&#39;re.<br>There&#39;s always a small group who believes this bullcrap, but I&#39;d say the target is always groups who doubt science not a specific area of the political spectrum. Also I&#39;d say it mostly affects older people for the same reason. As scientific knowledge spreads, I&#39;d like to believe most of these conspiracy theories will be forgotten in 20 years from now, and pseudoscience will be a thing from the past.

 Love your channel. however please refrain from cheap ad hominem argumentation (this author did what). The data of Green et al. and follow-up studies is hard to discard. The case is closed on Flouride additives being good against tooth dexay. However the scientific precautionary principle has been fogotten by many, and the case is far from clear regarding neutotoxicity. There is still a good chance it is neurotoxic, and data does not lie so easily and likely was not fabricated by Green et al. in a otherwise actually well conducted study. The study by Broadbent et al. has much more limitations in that it cannot look at direct influnces. So it is overclaim to say scientific consensus is reached on the neurotoxicant part, thus precaution would suggest to avoid Fouride intake in pregnant women and young children.

 Hello, I&#39;m aware that water fluoridation is perfectly fine and has benefits to us - but I am a bit concerned about recent articles that talk about Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that have seeped into the groundwater of certain cities.

Should I be concerned about this?

 My understanding of the origin of the “communists trying to poison our communities” myth is that it arose from the common use of hydrogen hexafluorosilicate to perform the fluoridation of water in public water supplies. This compound carries a legitimate toxicity risk because it can release toxic hydrogen fluoride vapor, a dangerously strong acid that can etch glass. The original argument, that storing this potential source of a toxic gas in municipal water treatment plants could allow it to be diverted by communist cells for gas warfare (unlikely, but not intrinsically antiscientific), got transformed in the minds of anti-fluoridation activists into the concept that fluoride ion itself is highly toxic.

 I do use a good gravity filter for my drinking water, but it&#39;s not because of fluoride propaganda.  I grew up with a safe (tested) deep well for our water.  I moved to a house on &quot;city&quot; water when I was 38.  I just can&#39;t drink it.  It tastes worse than chlorinated water to me.  It&#39;s so bad that any drink made with it is instantly detectable, and ruins it for me.  It doesn&#39;t help that the filters look like I ran used motor oil through them, within two weeks of filtering our tap water.  I completely understand that someone who grew up drinking it might not mind or even notice the taste of their tap water, but it&#39;s not something I can just be ok with at this point in my life.  I actually only drink water, so it does matter to me if I can stand the taste of it.  The easiest way to say it is the filtered water, expensive bottled water, and well water all tasted close to the same, and my current tap water tastes worse than a chlorinated pool.  We will use it when cooking some of our foods, but that&#39;s about as far as it goes.  I realize that public water quality is different in different areas, and it&#39;s possible that ours is just particularly awful, so I&#39;m not claiming anything about public water, other than what comes through our area&#39;s taps tastes terrible.

 My wife and I were worried about fluoride for our baby due to much of the misinformation spread about it. We don&#39;t have fluoride in the drinking water where I live, and we chose to brush with non-fluoridated toothpaste. Our son developed a small amount of bottle rot because of this terrible misinformation, as we thought we were doing what&#39;s best for our son. Luckily we were on top of things, and switched to a baby fluoride toothpaste, and his teeth immediately improved. He now has perfectly healthy teeth per the dentist thanks to fluoride.

You really have to look for the exceptions, and no I&#39;m not talking about &quot;all natural&quot; or &quot;non gmo&quot; type stuff. Flouride in toothpaste is a lot like fortified milk, orange juice or cereal. In America it&#39;s very common or in some cases mandated to include certain vitamins or minerals within staple foods to curb very preventable nutritional deficiencies like scurvy (your teeth fall out!). The general practice is called fortification and in some cases dramatically increases the health of a population. Vitamin D is added to milk all the time because Vitamin D and Calcium have a bit of a codependent effect in the human body. I&#39;m no expert, but it is what it is. Considering all of this, it&#39;s very very safe to say that if you live in a developed country there&#39;s lots of added goodies in your food. The same thing goes for toothpaste.<br><br>I agree that if the government wanted to enact chemical warfare on its citizens it would be trivial, however calling flouridation chemical warfare is shockingly stupid (no offense). For one, this is happening with multiple governments so unless you propose some sort of world order then there goes that theory. Then of course, there&#39;s the small fact that there&#39;s no discernable motive for doing this. Democratic governments depend on the welfare of their citizens, that&#39;s the reason why you get services like, oh I don&#39;t know, the American Dental Association. For a government to poison its own citizens is like shooting yourself in the foot. It&#39;s called chemical warfare because its WAR- the thing that happens between two DIFFERENT nations? Another point; if flouride did have enough of an effect on the human body to be useful to the orwellian world order, wouldn&#39;t these effects be measurable and easily exposed? And finally, there&#39;s the fact that flouridation is not being hidden AT ALL. If the chinese government were aware that the FBI was giving their citizens crack then I really don&#39;t think they&#39;d be too stoked about it.

 When I was in college my physiology professor gave us an article from Scientific American that suggested that fluoridation could have some negative effects after long term exposure. I think that it was called &quot;Second Thoughts About Fluoride.&quot; For this reason, I have felt a bit unsure about fluoride. Not losing sleep over it, I still use fluoride toothpaste and even fluoride mouth rinse once in awhile, but I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if there could be some slight long term effects. Like, what if fluoride water makes people feel less energetic or have low thyroid hormone, but its a small enough effect to not be very noticeable in a study. Years later, I suppose that that article in Scientific American might have been too sensational though. These are just my musings, I&#39;m actually very pro-science.

 I was working at an IOP science fayre a couple of years ago when I unfortunately had to deal with a water-based conspiracy theorist. I was using tin cans and string to explain to some kid how sound travels along string and a middle aged man interrupted us (bear in mind this event was literally made for children aged 12 and under) and told me if I think I know so much about how waves travel, how do dousing rods work? I was kinda dumbfounded and, because I didn&#39;t think anyone actually believed that stuff, I thought he was joking. When I realised he wasn&#39;t, after he started lecturing about a tour he went on where some guide found underground water with a wooden stick, I decided it wasn&#39;t in my job description and called my supervisor over so he could deal with him instead. I don&#39;t think he appreciated that.<br><br>Anyway thanks for the informative video, Dave.

For the same reason, sensationalist headlines are all the rage even if the story itself isn&#39;t that attention-worthy. <br><br>But as soon as pepper spray or, better yet, tasers are legalised here; I&#39;ll be first in line. The knife crime is so ridiculously high here that it will probably be a worthwhile investment all round.', 'Duck', '@EdwardHowton Yeah I understand the temptation to believe that the &#39;truth&#39; lies between two extremes but overall I think arguments to moderation are very unhelpful and proponents of them are rarely at all knowledgeable on the given subject. I think the position likely comes out of ignorance or an unwillingness to offend (although ironically it does seem to offend quite a lot). Personally sometimes I do find myself taking a middle ground on very polarising issues when asked just so I can avoid conflict on a subject I likely don&#39;t know enough about to argue well on; something I often kick myself for doing. It&#39;s definitely infuriating though when you&#39;re trying to explain something very objective and factual to someone but they&#39;re so aggressively moderate you might as well be talking to a brick wall.', 'Duck', '@EdwardHowton hahaha yeah if only pepper spray was legal in the UK all my problems would be solved. And yeah it was pretty strange, I think types like him enjoy going to science events in general so they can act superior to actual scientists for a day.']

 We buy water for prep-storage, and I always try and get the store brand because it&#39;s almost always the cheaper purchase. If you&#39;re buying Dasani or Nestle water, you&#39;re being scammed and paying for that label purely for &quot;flexing&quot; to friends.
