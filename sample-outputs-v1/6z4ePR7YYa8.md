Covering dynamic programming, top down vs bottom up approaches. What is memoization and tabulation. Will also answer a few quick problems like the Fibonacci series, Coin Change, Min Path Sum, 0-1 Knapsack, Subset Sum, and the Staircase problem.

 The word &quot;dynamic&quot; usually implies that time is an element of the problem (as opposed to static). However, as far as I can tell, the only role time plays here is that it takes time to run the programs.  I&#39;m glad you are here to explain this to us.

 why call it &quot;dynamic&quot; if it&#39;s something you pretty much chisel down in stone? If AI/AGI would understand it&#39;s own code completely and continually rewrite itself from &quot;scratch&quot; and rewrite it&#39;s own compiler to run as efficiently as possible on the hardware it&#39;s on, I&#39;d call that &quot;dynamic&quot;. This seems like the exact opposite, aka &quot;static&quot;

 Well for file based &quot;memory&quot;, one could just hash the problem, pop the state of the solution in a file in a directory with that hash, and then if another problem generates the same hash you can just check all the files in that directory to see if it the solution was already started before, sure a few extra details will be needed to identify if the solution is for the same/similar problem but that&#39;s relatively easy to add

 Good video on dynamic programming, but mentioning the Simpsons here seems kind of forced to get some extra attention (and its just for top down/bottom up while dynamic programming is also about memoization). 

 	Replies: ['SimonDev', 'I mention memoization in the video.<br><br>As for names, yeah, naming is hard. I&#39;m still learning the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of making a good one. I&#39;ve been getting some help with them, and this was a part of a change of 4-5 titles. This was a bit of a &quot;try it and see&quot; type of name. It&#39;s doing substantially better than the previous, boring title, but could still be much better.<br><br>You kinda have to try them out, see how they do for a week or 2, whether or not they improve views, and then try to brainstorm another. It&#39;s pretty crazy, but just subtle naming changes can bring you from obscure to large numbers of views.

 As you have shown, the first step is to find a recursive solution; then you cache the sub-solutions (memoization); then you get rid of the recursion and compute it bottom-up just to flex (dynamic programming.)<br>In my experience as a TA, CS students that struggle to learn dynamic programming actually just struggle to understand recursion, so they can&#39;t even get the first step done. 

 	Replies: ['VulpeculaJoy', 'In order to understand recursion, unless there is nothing left to understand, you must fist understand recursion a little bit less.', 'SimonDev', '@dkosmari Hah, harsh', 'dkosmari', '@SimonDev I encouraged them to change majors.', 'SimonDev', 'Recursion is definitely one of those slightly weird ways of thinking, got any tips on how you help those students out?']

 I&#39;ve written DP algorithms multiple times for comparing discrete sequences which is the min path sum problem you described. Or finding the minimum cost path through a 2D matrix from the bottom-left to the top-right. There are a few different ways to write it depending on how general you need it to be. It easy to lose sight of the generality of DP but you described it really well. Thanks

 	Replies: ['Jeff Wells', 'Yeah, at it&#39;s core it&#39;s just keeping a record of what you&#39;ve already done so you don&#39;t have to do it again. For repetitive problems this can lead to some crazy efficiency gains. I think Fibonacci is so popular as an example because the difference between a memoized and non-memoized recursive Fibonacci algorithm is so stark, it really drives the benefits home. Like, a modern PC will struggle building out Fibonacci trees past 50 for the non-memoized version, but numbers in the millions aren&#39;t a problem for the memoized version.<br><br>The real struggle for dynamic programing is understanding the pieces so you can adequately memoize the problem.
