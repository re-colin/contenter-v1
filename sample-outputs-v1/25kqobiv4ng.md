Correction to what I say at 11:53  -- I was referring to Milgram's famous experiments in which people administered electroshocks to others when ordered so. It had nothing to do with prisons. The prison experiment was from Philip Zimbardo, not Milgram. Sorry about that. 

When we come together in groups we can be so much more than the sum of the parts. But sometimes groups are just much more stupid. Collective stupidity is the flipside of collective intelligence, and we see it a lot on social media. Why are groups sometimes collectively stupid and sometimes not? What can we do to be more intelligent in groups? In this video I explain the most important points.

 Sabine- you are talking more about Intelligence and lack of,  not stupidity. There are several simple reasons for ‚Äò stupidity‚Äô - lack of education, lack of worldliness, inability to comprehension, inability to think critically. Also herd mentality. Lack of individualism. Lack of an adventurist attitude. A willingness to NOT rock the boat and follow.   Not to mention misinformation, disinformation, lack of information. Then, and I mean this kindly, some are plain stupid. Their mental capacity of deficient.

 Excellent. This confirms my belief that we need to add Critical Thinking to the educational curriculum in UK schools. Not sure our politicians would agree though.  I was lucky enough to have parents who encouraged me to analyse the data from multiple sources and make up my own mind. Not that I have always followed the rule. Like most people I guess, I have felt social or physical pressure to agree with the views of others, even if I disagreed with them but not about anything really important I hope.

 I used to think I was immune to this phenomenon. I was once a self identified ‚Äòoutlier‚Äô. Then I leant more about critical thinking, statistics, psychological processes and sociology. Then I realised I wasn&#39;t special, that I was, in fact, just as susceptible to faulty rationale in many spheres of thought. The more I studied the more I was able to identify, within myself, the errors. The only thing I realised is that it&#39;s a never ending process of self reflection and inquiry. That the moment you truly believe that you&#39;re ‚Äònot one of them‚Äô, you probably are.

 James and his friend are truly in a world known only to them. Here you see them pass a cigarette to each other, only there is no cigarette. James friend later smokes it and actually flicks the ashes, again there was nothing in his hand. James Styles his hair with an imaginary comb. He beckons to friends in the room that only he can see. There is fear in the eyes of both boys and major anxiety. Motor coordination skills are almost completely gone.

 May I humbly request the champion of theoretical physics, in this matter of collective sanity, to also consider the phenomenon of symmetry in the respective emergent systems, especially the brain and the whole society.<br>Already the emergent system of water waves is still bound to the conservation laws which are (as Emmy Noether has shown) symmetry laws. So if you throw a stone in the water you will see, with your very eyes, as many waves going down as there are waves going up. If you touch a string, however, you will not see anything. But another measurement instrument will tell you about the space waves you have generated in the air. According to Indian or Vedic empirical knowledge even the intellect (‚ÄúBuddhi‚Äù) is a measurement instrument (both on an individual and a cosmic level). That may explain the existence of theoretical physicist who when looking at void nothingness, i.e. the quantum vacuum, find innumerable waves and particles in it, and perhaps a whole universe, or nowadays many of them.<br>On another level, the level of (emergent) biological systems you have symmetries that come along as circuits, cycles, circular flow, circulation, closed loops, homeostasis, etc. For instance, in cells you have the citric acid cycle which is a series of chemical reactions to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. In the bodies of animals and human beings you have the blood circulatory system (which feeds the citric acid cycle on the cellular level). Circular structures are closely related to waves as you can see when your cardiogram is recorded. In the first lesson on waves at school, sine waves are shown to be derivable from circular motions. <br>Another type of symmetry on the level of physiology is laterality. Your body seems to possess a mirror symmetry between left and right. This, however, too leads finally to circular interactions, as you can see with regard to your hands. One of them, usually the left one is weaker and holds, while the other one, usually the right one, acts. Especially important (and here we are coming to the topic of Sabine‚Äôs video) is the laterality of the brain. Both symmetry and broken symmetry of the hemispheres of the human cortex are extensively discussed in a very important book written by a Scottish brain researcher: ‚ÄúThe Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World‚Äù by Iain McGilchrist. I have written a review on the book here: <a href="https://www.academia.edu/40638740/Review_of_a_Brain_Researcher_s_Book_on_the_Hemispheres">https://www.academia.edu/40638740/Review_of_a_Brain_Researcher_s_Book_on_the_Hemispheres</a>. The author‚Äôs conclusion is that since Luther‚Äôs Reformation and since the Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, the circular flow between the two hemispheres is greatly disturbed. The left hemisphere in which the center of speech is found has empowered itself as the dominant hemisphere. Speech (or language), however, measures and therefore always lies ‚Äì as quantum measurement does. (David Tong, theoretical physicist at Oxford, says in a very delightful lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVQfWC_evg&amp;t=1180s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVQfWC_evg&amp;t=1180s</a> on the question what we are made of ‚ÄúAtoms are a lie, we are the field‚Äù). <br>(Perhaps to be continued)

 When I take the time to evaluate a situation or point of view, I try to understand the levels of greed, tribalism and stupidity involved. Your presentation suggests the first two contribute significantly to the third, but stupidity seems capable of spontaneous generation in any collection of humans.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25kqobiv4ng&amp;t=11m49s">11:49</a> Slight correction: Milgrim did a different social conformity experiment, which preceded the Stanford Prison Study (which was &quot;performed&quot; by Philip Zimbardo. Not an experiment either, as there was no control group and no random assignment). Milgrim&#39;s study was on social conformity to authority, and he was seeing how far people would go in shocking (he was not actually shocking) another person.

 Certain (perhaps all) politicians know this very well. If you say something (a lie) with enough confidence, loudly enough and perhaps most importantly often enough, the people will start believing it! No matter how far from the truth it may be! Note: certain politicians repeat the same words 3 or more times in a row, to convince those listening to believe them. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

 One solution: encouraging diversity: &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot; (fable).<br><br>I am somewhat neurodiverse - and (especially when younger) would often disrupt what I saw as stupid convergent, prejudiced (in broadest sense) and blinkered group-think in presentations and discussions.  <br><br>Those present would typically understand and agree - though (oddly) only for a month or two, over which the point would decay in their minds (as they &quot;defaulted to type&quot;). Even for higher education type people. Even some (thankfully not all) PhD people (eg who preferred continuity to disruption, for various self-beneficial reasons).<br><br>From my POV, especially when younger, I achieved a good reputation in &quot;lateral thinking&quot;.  Thereby feeding my ego - encouraging future such contributions to &quot;the crowd&quot;.<br><br>I think this is nature&#39;s &quot;point&quot; in producing diversely thinking people.  A tool by which society can help mitigate its own stupidity.  Provided it desires that outcome and knows how to to use such tools.<br><br>The fundamental &quot;loose end&quot; to all this though is differing philosophies hence value systems. Some would want us to mess the world up more because we are &quot;having it too easy&quot;.

 Hi. A good theory always bears repeating, especially when Sabine adds her weight to the hypothesis first proposed by Victorian intellectual Charles McKay. In his book &quot;Extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds&quot;, (1841), McKay wrote: &quot;men go mad in crowds, and only slowly regain their senses, one by one&quot;.  If Sabine has &quot;seen further, it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot; (Second quote by Sir Isaac Newton.) Cheers, P.R.

 My Mom used to work with a child abuse agency. She said that there is a special way to question kids so you don&#39;t influence what they say. Kids often say what they think you want to hear instead of their personal observations, so you have to avoid asking leading questions. For example, if you are asking about if a door was open or closed, you ask &quot;how was the door?&quot;

 Advice I&#39;ve long given to people when working with boys and young men:  &quot;The average IQ of a group of boys goes down with every boy you add to the group.&quot;  1 or 2 boys unsupervised are not as likely to do something stupid.  A group of 5 boys are almost guaranteed to do something stupid if left unsupervised for very long.  Grown men are not immune to this phenomenon - they&#39;re just better at not getting caught.

There are two sides of this.  The first is Social Acceptance.  The second is Trolls/Pranksters.  My small group of friends just loved to troll.  Like one time I figured out how to get into the School District Account List.  Figured out you can shift select 1000 people at a time and send everyone a message.  I got suspended for a month for that.  Another time we stole like 50 vibrators from a store and turned them on and put them everywhere around the school.<br><br>Another time guys on the Baseball team were trying to get me to fight someone.  I punched one them right in the face instead.  As I had bullied quite a bit and was a very angry person due to my Father dying.  So I just decked this kid pressuring me to fight.  And that is one of the reasons I never ever would hang out with anyone of any of the sports teams.  They always try to pull some macho nonsense.  Baseball coach was pissed at first when I told exactly what happened he kinda chuckled.  Instant Karma right don&#39;t try to bully kids into fighting for respect or whatever.    <br><br>If I had hung out with the Sports kids.  And not the Troll/Stoner/Skater/Video Gamer kids.  I probably would have done more Hazing type nonsense.  Instead I was bullied and an outsider for a large part of my life.  And became very angry and just never took crap from anyone.  If I was accepted into Social Circles more readily I probably would have went along with whatever nonsense.  That is also another key thing.  Acceptance.  Guys will do many thing to feel accepted.  I was over that by age of 14.  Luckily that is when I found my one true friend.  If a young guy doesn&#39;t have a best friend that is a very bad thing.  Every man needs one true best friend.']

 I think in previous days, the stupidity of an individual would be contained within the safety bubble of their friends, family and perhaps a few silly opinions down in their local pub. Nowadays, the internet has provided a method for the individual to broadcast their stupidity worldwide, often attracting other stupid people they wouldn&#39;t have otherwise met. This appears to create a &#39;stupidity snowball&#39;, which rolls down the hill of illogical nonsense, where more and more stupid people stick to it, until there are so many stupid people it starts to form a stupidity iceberg, where the plausible part sticks out and the much larger hidden world of illogical insanity and idiocy is hidden below the surface.

 Maybe we could use a table to define stupidity. We can define any action as being beneficial or harmful. If it is beneficial to yourself and others it is sensible.  If it is beneficial to yourself but harmful to someone else it is selfish. If it is harmful to yourself but beneficial to others it is charitable or sacrificial. If it is harmful to yourself and harmful to others it is stupid. For example, is failure to act on climate change stupid in the long run?

 Psychotics believe something that is manifestly untrue and although they cannot be argued out of their erroneous views  it is not to their benefit to agree with them.  Collective psychosis occurs  when groups  believe manifest untruths (&quot;tear him for his bad verses&quot; as Shakespeare&#39;s rioters yell.). It is not to your benefit to agree but it could be very dangerous and require courage to disagree. The most vocal supporters of (for example) the two American parties are psychotic. The strange behaviour of crowds has been noted and written about for a long time. It doesn&#39;t seem to have had a lot of influence on the frequency of collective psychosis.

I knew it was coming when the I sat in a room filled with relations of all ages being asked what they were going to vote. I was the only one voting Stay and I hid behind an answer that my vote was between me and the ballot box. This was answered by the leader saying he thought he knew which way I was going to vote. By that I think he meant the same as the rest of the family. I never told him he was wrong both on what I would vote and the fact he was voting to Leave. I bet that now they would all vote Stay In when they see all the bad things happening to UK and the world looks on at our Continued Stupidity.

 Even a box of rocks is smart enough to retain its own properties.  By doing so, it does not even need any intelligence, it just needs to be what it is.<br>I&#39;ve always found that you are as dumb as a &quot;insert your favorite here&quot;, is just condescending to that object or objects.  No need to compare, to be stupid is quite far below an inanimate object.  For an inanimate object will still remain that way, it doesn&#39;t need to think to do so.<br><br>Now collective stupidity is even more obnoxious than just one person.  If you have a room of stupid people, the dumbest person wins.  So they will try to out dumb each other, usually to a standard that reality just doesn&#39;t support.  So you get a collective IQ of -17 when the 3 people in the room are just functioning at 21, 13, and 7.<br><br>Now if you could just do the formula on that for collective stupidity, well no one would pay attention anyway.

 Regarding the experiment with 800 people guessing the weight of the bull, I wonder what would happen if you then removed 200 outliers, i.e. 100 people from either end of the range of weight guessed who were most inaccurate. If the remaining 600 people were then asked to guess the weight of another bull, would their answer be more or less accurate? How many people could you remove before the answer became wildly inaccurate? Are the people guessing closest to the correct weight better at guessing or simply better at guessing in this one instance? So it them becomes a question of whether the outliers could guess something on another topic more accurately or if the core group of people guessing accurately would always have better guesses. <br><br>TLDR: Does manipulation of a crowd post-guess improve the accuracy of the crowd&#39;s wisdom?

 Ironically, I just got here after watching a video about Elong Musk being interviewed about twitter - his question seems applicable here; &quot;Who is the arbiter for misinformation?&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a fair question; when we have a collective, we don&#39;t have any regulatory mechanism in that when we use humans to draw an opinion, we don&#39;t have anything left to check this - no arbiter.<br>Similarly; your comment about not correcting Wikipedia; with respect, how do you know you are correct? How much of our collective intelligence regulation is a function of the individual&#39;s willingness to conform to the system? If you don&#39;t make that correction, another physicist will no longer have the opportunity to point out to you that you are incorrect...<br>(not saying you are but my point stands I think)<br><br>We are essentially trying to refine our own decisions using strength in numbers but simultaneously are left with only one option of self-regulation which is not efficient.<br>A practical illustration of this is pair programming in Agile software development methodologies - 2 heads are said to be better than one, but these pitfalls you mention crop up time after time; interestingly the effects of these pitfalls is lessened in this case when you enforce separation every now and then; I find individuality is important and should be peppered about among teams, pairs should split up every few days etc.; it arrests the &#39;cascade&#39; and gives sense a chance to prevail.

 &quot;Systemic bias&quot;. I have difficulty with &#39;collective stupidity&#39; being applied to the most successful species on the planet. Not a defense of capitalism, but the super organism would see these events much like a capitalist&#39;s &quot;cost of doing business&quot;. The ants &quot;use&quot; intelligence in this scenario in much that same way that water &quot;uses&quot; gravity to travel down stream... in that they aren&#39;t using it at all, and merely &quot;going with the flow&quot; as it were. One must possess some level of individual intelligence in order to be part of a collective intelligence, and many of these super organism only show individual intelligence very rarely. When a super organism shows intelligence, it is almost never based on &quot;choices&quot; of individuals within the collective, but rather preprogrammed responses to certain stimuli as a species. Honey bees do not become docile around smoke because they choose to do so. Differing breeds of ants don&#39;t declare colony wide war at first contact because they choose to, but because they can&#39;t choose not to.

 The presence of, or lack of, conscious, directed, deliberate, intentional, volitional: thought. People who actually devote mental energy, and time, to intentionally <b>think</b> about topics and issues, and question available resources and common answers - are what differentiates smart from stupid. Therefore, if you have a group of people who either do think and question or do not think and simply accept the consensus you will observe either collective intelligence or collective stupidity. I&#39;m not one of those people who claims that the census is always wrong - but the two rabbit experiment shows that a <b>consensus can easily be wrong.</b>

 I&#39;ve never heard such a bunch of claptrap in my life. The situation on the ground is that the high-functioning no longer want to carry the neurotypical mob. By being change-resistant, they squelch the brightest, as seen in the recent BBC2 Newsnight Program on Simon Baron-Cohen&#39;s failure to recruit enough neurodivergents to do a genetic study on them. We remember Hans Asperger&#39;s studies only too well, and Baron-Cohen&#39;s work is about tearing us down.<br>The reason we have self-defined as divergent is the stupidity of the mob. I am &quot;probably&quot; a genius, as I took the concepts the Head of Yale&#39;s new Genius School, applied them to work I had done which extends sideways one of his own studies (in his previous post as Professor of the History of Music) by adding a similar work in Art, and then attaching the birth of the Windesheim School to them as a capstone, finding an academic case compliant with the norms of the day, which sparked the Renaissance. I&#39;m now attached at post-doctoral level to the Warburg Institute.<br>That&#39;s not savant skills: I&#39;ve done serious work in psychology, diplomacy, energy supply, and much more.<br>The typical experience is Alan Turing&#39;s. Despite being a genius in number theory, he was driven to suicide for non-conformity. In your own presentation, you presume we&#39;re part of humanity. If being termed a weirdo and misfit by a government adviser is inclusive, bring back the witch-hunts.

 Very good presentation, and well deserving of its popularity. Like many good ideas, however, this one relies on the false premise that ‚Äúwe‚Äù can decide on a course of action that ‚Äúwe‚Äù conclude is best for everyone. This is the principle upon which democracies are built, but even democracies have occasion to succumb to collective stupidity. Powers are separated for this reason, and measures are taken to reduce the electoral influence of stupid collectives bent on undermining democracy and handing everything over to a demagogue. The disruptive influence of demagoguery inspired Socrates to doubt the viability of democracy, and to prefer instead a Republic overseen by an educated elite. The founders of the US knew all about Socrates and about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and tried their best to protect their creation from demagogues. It always remains to be seen whether they will have succeeded in doing so in the long run. This is due in large part to those whom Socrates understood favored demagogues and whom the founders of the US knew as loyalists. They represent today (and probably always have) about a third of the electorate. Read about Babiak &amp; Hare‚Äôs ‚Äúone-thirds rule‚Äù in ‚ÄúSnakes in Suits‚Äù (2006 et.seq,).

 The English spelling system and the spell-shamers (esp. on social media such as Twitter) are the epitome of this stupidity. As a linguistics major &amp; retired teacher I remind them that the system has 10&#39;s of 1000&#39;s of errors, if WE extrapolate on Masha Bell&#39;s research, that they don&#39;t care to correct or reform. I tell them the research says it causes years of delays in reading acquisition. (Seymour, 2003) I tell them that if there were a reform, they would not have to learn a new system (See French Reform). I tell them Einstein struggled learning to spell in English. The research shows no link between IQ and spelling ability. I tell them Orwell asked for a reform saying how impressive it is. I tell them the brightest minds tried to reform it; there should be some merit to the idea. They quadruple down, don&#39;t sign my petition, and keep on spell-shaming, often misspelling in the process. Prove me wrong and ask for my petition! ;)

 I&#39;ts not confidence that should be criticized (risk of weeding out/misinterpreting confident people who know what they&#39;re talking about) rather THE MORE SOMEBODY TRIES TO CONVINCE YOU OF SOMETHING the more you should question their intentions/motivations.  Nearly nobody is AS interested in convincing you of some truth verses trying to convince you of a lie, right?  You know, there is actually a DIRECT CORRELATION between the intensity with which somebody tries to convince you of something and the likeliness that they actually have the same trait or issue.  People betray themselves through a pattern that their behavior creates. Like, when you&#39;re driving by an accident and start rubbernecking only to find that the longer you look the more you drift to that side of the road.  We go where we look.  So eventually that behavior will collect into a pattern that is soooooo easily to read.  I&#39;ts like if everybody were unable to lie, how helpful would that be?  As much as it&#39;s helped it&#39;s also been mindbogglingly frustrating.  Ya know, like watching middle class, middle America Trump supporters slowly being drug along with such ridiculous and OBVIOUS lies, ones that slowly cut their own legs off....... losing union benefits, wages, epa deregulation resulting in toxic &quot;whatever&quot; that&#39;s dumped into their watershed/neighborhoods, economic deregulation resulting in the loss of their retirements &amp; maybe foreclosure of their subprime home loan.  Anyhow, recognizing this pattern had been truly priceless when dealing with people, it works with groups pretty well too.  Wish I knew it when I was a child, all the primary and metadata that&#39;s imprinted on us in those early years that turns out to be total BS......

 Your presentation touches upon the idea that individual contributions to an issue can come to a fairly true evaluation of the reality. One of the conditions for this to be true is that the result of the other participants is not known to the person participating to avoid their decision or perspective influencing their private perspective. In government elections however, opinions are broadcast widely on media, numerous polls are taking how people are responding to these opinions, and these polls also are published; in the end people may be swept up in this cascade rather than remain true to their own opinions. Aside from this technical issue having first past the post elections instead of proportional representation is a more fundamental factor influencing possible election outcomes.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25kqobiv4ng&amp;t=14m00s">14:00</a> about the finance crisis in 2008, I strongly disagree. The issue was never that banks gave high risk loans, that&#39;s a myth spread to protect the real culprits: the repacking of those low grade assess into high grade &quot;financial instruments&quot;, that through corrupt credit rating institutes then could be further repacked into AAA-assets, sold, resold and be used as security for other loans. In short, it was the Wall Street fraud of selling polished turds as 24k gold bars that caused the collapse.

 &quot;Group think&quot; at work meetings is a very real problem, especially with projects with very aggressive üìÖ schedules.<br><br> When group think appeared to be happening, some of the better managers I&#39;ve worked with would pose the question, &quot;Before we move on, what things have we not yet considered?&quot; That was a good mechanism to prevent us sleepwalking into a bad decision.<br><br>Another mechanism to counter group think, according to World War Z, is the &quot;10th man&quot; doctrine. This is where, if it appears that a consensus is being converged on too quickly on a complex question, one individual in the group is tasked with taking on a contradictory position on the problem.<br> <br>This forces the &quot;other 9&quot; team members to defend the majority/consensus view against the 10th man&#39;s questions.

 We are all cheese crackers with emergence. Dually noted. I always thought it takes anti-social personality disorder to truly appreciate this video. If a psychologist makes  a determination based upon social interface... well, look at our culture. My social interface is a gag reflex. More and more people are identifying as &quot;sigma&quot;, a think for yourself attitude. That would mean we grudgingly subordinate to corporate culture&#39;s need for type A followers. A fear of thinking for yourself and expressing ideas in the workplace, questioning our education system and government, etc. I don&#39;t watch the news, I disseminate the bias and information warfare. It&#39;s that bad, but I think our societal intelligence is evolving, while sector based intelligence is not going anywhere unless leaders project/promote change. Have you ever had a moment where you said, &quot;wow, they finally get it&quot;? That&#39;s because somebody in power took note of the end-user reaction. It&#39;s all about the venue, different kinds of group intelligence, power/leader base versus passive acceptance. People turn off their brains.

 Dear Sabine,  asch&#39;s experiments expose the desire to be accepted by a group. This evolutionarily favored survival and possibility of social status, over difference of opinion, EVEN WHEN IT DIFFERS WITH OBSERVABLE FACT.<br><br>It is related to the diminution of molecular sense - smell is truth, while the kazoo-like vocalizations of humans are uttered or scrawled for that social acceptance/dominance.<br><br>We tend to herding, as together we can defeat the largest individual. The behavior drives both error and deception, our species&#39; greatest and most often used skill.<br>See how adults weave fables, lies, to the young?<br><br>Outgrouping someone is among the most memorable and resentment-filled experiences they will ever have, outside physical trauma and death, when analogous experiences arise.<br><br>We prize honesty in others, while defecting from it when superior self-interest occurs.<br>Messianic religion is sanctified self-interest group formation, disgusting as both are.<br><br>We are highly uncomfortable with uncertainty, for very good evolutionary = survival, reasons. This is perhaps far more anciently selected for. We gain hedonic hormonal and neural pleasure from pursuing knowledge, completion, answers.<br><br>Scientific communities are thus regarded as existentially dangerous to messianic religious groupies, as unprovable lies and distorted origin and ubermenschen stories are threatened by repeatedly supported hypotheses, and by statistical athematical realities.<br><br>This leads to genocidal violence by those who choose ingroup dominance as raison d&#39;etre.<br><br>So, collective violence, er, trumps, collective intelligence, and is collective stupidity&#39;s default response.<br><br>Stanley Milgram&#39;s famous electrical shock experiments, not in the video, showed willingness to be submissive to authority, abdication of ethics.<br>This illuminated herding behavior in our species when domestically confined.<br><br>With escape options, most herd species will abandon collective behavior when exterior threat singles out and takes a target. That calm response of returning to individual self interest tends to be reflected in our own defections, changes in attention, and disaffection, but i must end here.

 Our collective intelligence is a computer. Since we can&#39;t individually handle all the parts of the systemic problems we are presented with, we each search for our little part of the answer. <br>What you call &quot;stupidity&quot; is actually parts of the answer that aren&#39;t stitched together yet or are the result of intentional jamming. <br>Furthermore this collective intelligence really can achieve great results, hence it&#39;s a threat to our current system of governance. So we are being bombarded with information to jam our capacity to come together and find solutions. Elections are a great example of this; not only are we given information overload but most of it is meant to tell us to NOT explore all possibilities, which is the way in which our collective intelligence naturally works. We are also told to censor certain solutions since (according to some people) voting the wrong way could get people elected we don&#39;t want to see there (strategical vote). That&#39;s signal jamming 101. <br>So in the end I don&#39;t believe in collective stupidity. But I do believe some people unable to process information and therefore call it background noise or stupidity. <br>TLDR : It&#39;s a collective thing, you can&#39;t analyse individual answers and expect coherence!

 For many decades, in the American School System, it was believed that by placing ‚Äògifted‚Äô, or more accurately - intelligent, children into a group of average to below average students, the groups‚Äô performance on tests would increase.  In fact, in a study published in early 2000s, the opposite affect was shown to be true.  In other words, the ‚Äògifted‚Äô students soon became as ignorant as the mean of the group.  There is only one way to overcome ignorance: through disciplined study.  <br><br>Social media is garbage and is  much more than a casual distraction from studying, but is deleterious to intelligence.  If the US educators were truly committed to the field, all public schools should renounce all sources of Social Media by their deleting accounts and developing education based platforms.  Perhaps then American kids taught in the US eduction system will become on par with their European/Asian cohorts?

 @Sabine Hossenfelder ~ your use of the term ‚Äúcollective‚Äù is incorrect to begin with. <br><br>Collectives are replete in diversity, never fixed to any one individual nature, regardless the numbers involved. <br><br>We are hardly ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù when we‚Äôre composed of an infinite number of collective processes. Specific persons, yea, but not individuals. Terms like that are a result of US counter intelligence programs. It‚Äôs basically right wing linguistic eugenics, right? No. *Correct. <br><br>You see, they teach us how to speak and thus how to think whilst the original derivation/etymology of the terms tells us something else. <br><br>Mobs are not collectives when they only project one individual nature over the collective whole. That‚Äôs individualistic in nature. Group think is the same thing. <br><br>Contrary to the red, white, and brainwash, collectives offer the most inclusivity as individualism forces everyone to repeat after one individual thing, what you confuse for ‚Äúcollective‚Äù today..<br><br>It‚Äôs nuanced and only hons under scrutiny. Please give it some critical thought.<br><br>..be more than an ‚ÄúIndividual‚Äù, Sabine..<br><br>*also, every time you hear that word ‚ÄúIndividual‚Äù, you should have a shot of water.

 I disagree with your 2008 financial crash example. It was not a result of an information cascade. It was purposeful bank policy to saddle people with debt, which was then passed on to the government. Banks and not homeowners were bailed out as they, at the same time, collected from hedging their bad investments. Also.. AAA ratings have nothing to do with information cascades. Ratings are the stamp of approval supposedly derived from careful assessment not hearsay or gossip.

 In college I had a class in critical thinking. The instructor had us get into groups of 7. We read compound sentences and interpreted the sentences. We agreed on several compound sentences but then came a confusing sentence. We debated and 6 of us agreed that the sentence meant one thing but the 7th team member disagreed. One fellow just said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs wrong, move on.‚Äù I said ‚Äúlet him explain himself, because maybe he‚Äôs right.‚Äù And so we heard the lone dissenter, and it became clear to all of us, except the guy that wanted to move on quickly, that the lone dissenter was correct in his analysis. The guy that refused to listen to the lone dissenter never would change his mind. But I wonder if that wasn‚Äôt some sort of a social experiment and the disagreeable fellow was a plant to see how we would respond. I‚Äôd like to believe we passed the test, if it was a test.

Since then almost the whole industry flipped on its head into the pedantic inclusiveness; ultimately feel good and not real more like a de-facto standard operating procedure -- or you&#39;ll be fired we now have in this current era beginning with the popularization of the concept of &quot;Woke&quot; which in and of itself was a counter intelligence operation to stem the tide of people &quot;Waking up&quot; (in reference to the sleeping apathetic westerner) to a developing technocratic tyranny since the end of the second world war accelerating very palpably from the mid 2000&#39;s to, you guessed it, 2016.  Propaganda be so predictable.   The EU is a perfect example of rule by &quot;experts&quot; aka technocracy not unlike Huxley&#39;s book &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

 Prime example of collective stupidity - The Climate agenda .. but You probably aren&#39;t ready to accept this yet.<br><br>But lets take a problem that will become real &quot;soon&quot; ...

As more and more get their information from AI&#39;s (the &quot;google it&quot; problem), they will relay that same information, which the AI will then use to learn from, and relay that information again - Becomming a self enforcing feedback loop. So the obvious problem is when the data the AI learns from is incorrect or not precise, or the AI does not understand inferred meanings that a human does, or the AI does not consider non binary answers or incomplete knowledge (aka Science).<br><br>As humans the natural evolution is that we will rely more and more on AI to help us remember and know things our average brains are not capable of handling; see it as enhancing your brain with AI knowledge and decision making properties as a way to become smarter as a species. I can not see any other way human evolution can go... maybe you got other theories ?<br>Obviously, it will not come overnight .. it will come as convenience: easier access to &quot;google&quot; or other AI systems, suggestions to &quot;best practises&quot; directly to your feed, your feed becomming more integrated such as augmentations or just thinking about something instead of typing or talking to the machine, augmented systems that uses collective learning, etc.

 On the prevention of hair looking like sauerkraut question... You have a few options, but all of them start with a good hair stylist the easiest way to find a good hair stylist is to visit either London or a major asian city such as Bangkok or Tokyo. Obviously there will be good hair stylists in any country but it will be much harder to find one in the USA, for example (have you seen their TV news anchors!?). Radio in Redchurch Street in London&#39;s east-end could be a good example. They did an amazing job on my daughter&#39;s hair after she cut it by accident as a little girl and gave her a completely new look that was just fantastic. You are going to need to explain to them your feelings of ineptitude about your hair so they will be motivated to find a solution that works for you. Many hairdressers will try to just go with what you already have, so they&#39;ll need to be told explicitly if you are looking for something different, especially if you don&#39;t know what that &#39;different&#39; is. You will also need to take their recommendations on which products to buy, and to not use cheap hair products from the supermarket. Once you have a cut you are happy with and some products that work for your hair, it will be much easier for you to replicate your results with a local stylist. I feel like I want to end this comment with some kind of compliment but everything I can think of is even more patronising than the rest of this post, so I&#39;ll just leave it at that.

Once the fiscal incentives to enact various countermeasures began to be based on numbers of &#39;cases&#39;, it became actually lucrative to report more &#39;cases&#39;, as it became commensurately risky to assert that the impact of this &#39;pandemic&#39; (the belief in the  existence of which was being continually bolstered by escalating rumors and gossip) was less than popularly believed. The net effect was for everything from mask mandates to lockdown laws to &#39;vaccine&#39; requirements to take on a competitive nature: to be requiring more strict and harsh countermeasures, regardless either of their cost or their measurable effectiveness, was presented as demonstrating greater &#39;concern&#39; for public health, while to be seen undertaking less or even no countermeasures was interpreted as careless and even homicidal.<br><br>To this day, I cringe every single time I hear anyone use the phrase &#39;during the pandemic&#39;, as though this were some kind of statement of established fact, when I already know that no legitimate research had ever been done or will ever be done to determine how many of the so-called &#39;case&#39; numbers were pure fabrications aimed at funding eligibility, because the very faith in there ever having been any such thing as a &#39;pandemic&#39; (other than a purely behavioral one, propelled mainly by the far greater threat of social-media behaviors) has come to replace actual knowledge about an event which had been over-estimated in both its scope and its effects from the earliest days of the rumors and gossip which generated it.

 I am not sure if we can and here is why. Efforts that we think are countering collecting stupidity can just as much be feeding into our own bias and from that ironically feeding into collective stupidity. This means aspects of the roles we play may become affected how we perceive them. Even great scientists can be tricked by their own skepticism of an idea and buy into a misunderstanding of something that is being passed around enough to only see the misunderstanding until that concept is pushed enough and that itself can lead to its own collective stupidity. On the other hand over accepting these ideas can just as much lead to collective stupidity.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25kqobiv4ng&amp;t=14m00s">14:00</a> The 2008 had other causes, depending on the country you were in.  In the United States, the government had put laws in place that forced &quot;signature loans&quot; into being.  These were loans in which the bank could not inquire into the financial solvency of the person requesting the loan if it related to real estate; they just required a signature on the mortgage agreement, no questions asked. This was forced on the lenders under the rather spurious claim that checking for financial solvency, an income, and a means to repay was &quot;racist&quot;.  <br>The 2008 collapse was governmentally mandated, and exacerbated by lenders who realized the problem, but decided to ride the bubble for all it was worth (if they were going to be forced into it anyway).  The government then bailed out the lenders they lured into the dysfunctional cycle (but not the individuals who lost their homes).  And, in the end, no one learned anything except that the government was now politically meddling in the market (with no clue how it actually functioned) and large financial institutions could just invest stupidly.  Then those institutions could leverage their positions to get the government to print money and hand it to them when things inevitably go wrong.

 Poll results; unfortunately the &#39;habit&#39; of divulging political polls while voting is taking place over the course of a day has an adverse impact upon the democratic process because psychological studies have shown that people who haven&#39;t voted often look to polling to decide who they vote for because &quot;everyone wants to be a winner&quot; so they pick candidates based upon who they think will win. A candidates views and background too often has little to do with such choices. It&#39;s interesting to note the American founders were aware of &quot;averages&quot; when it came to public policy. They generally believed averages would work out for the better based upon the disposition of voters overall. It was the basis of which their view of democracy was built upon. Unfortunately, American history and in particular current events provide confirmation the founder&#39;s general consensus was on shaky ground. There might even be some correlation between right-wing conservative fanaticism made between current political division in the US between the rise of that fanaticism and the rise of the wealthier southern states since the 1990s when profit seeking drove historically northern liberal industries south and even over-seas. That increased wealth in the south granted to the south a broader and more powerful platform to promote their conservatism socially and politically.

 The problem with people in groups is not that they are stupid, certainly not in the sense that they lack brain power. Rather it is the very opposite: the evident abundance in brain power that results from acting in concert tends toward an increase in confidence to the point of conceit and the loss of inhibitions.  As such the group is liable to indulge in behavior that the ordinary individual would be too ashamed of or inhibited to undertake alone.  So one may deplore following the herd, but the reality is that following the herd tends to work well.  On the other hand, this can work so well that the herd easily creates for itself such a sense of its own validity, entitlement and invincibility that its path leads right over a cliff.

The big supermarkets are also at fault due to their &quot;just-in-time&quot; replenishment of shop stocks from suppliers/own warehouses.  It&#39;s easy to knock the public but nobody wants to reach for the toilet-paper and find none there.  It&#39;s no comfort to know that other folk have enough toilet-paper for their needs.

 my two cents about toilet paper. it&#39;s surprisingly poorly understood as to why exactly toilet paper was a thing, but understanding the economics in general and then applied on toilet paper makes it very, very obvious.<br><br>so, here&#39;s a quick recap: toilet paper has rather unique properties which are responsible why this was the most sought after good when the pandemic broke lose. firstly, the consumption of this product is incredibly constant. people might change all sorts of things in their life, but their toilet behavior won&#39;t be one of those. so, usage is insanely predictable to begin with. then, it&#39;s supposed to be decently cheap because people don&#39;t give shit about too high a piece and eventually settle with what&#39;s affordable in the long run. but toilet paper has very poor logistic properties: while not heavy, it&#39;s spacious; this makes storage pretty expensive. given rather low margin rates, it&#39;s best to fine tune the entire production to just about the closely predictable level of consumption and keep stock supply as low as possible. and that&#39;s exactly the reason why this product is the most sensitive of all too only very, very minor changes. and since everyone needs it, as soon as news around a shortage spread, this effect only gonna increase itself. but that it was toilet paper to make the first start wasn&#39;t like a coincidence. and since usage typically doesn&#39;t very much, it was very difficult to ramp up production (especially given that investments like new machineries won&#39;t ever pay off itself because everyone knew, everything will eventually normalize again within a very few month maximum.) that&#39;s why exactly this product is the most sensitive to extremely subtle changes in demand. 

 	Replies: ['HeRo TuRtle', '@Tony I see. yes, that surely helped pushing that first initial shift required for it to end in that death spiral. but extremely low stock for a voluminous product that doesn&#39;t sell for much money but which usage is highly predictable is also the other given factor making this possible. remember, it was a worldwide thing‚Äînot constrained to one particular country. something similar can be said about the oil piece. while the usage did drop, it was as much as people assume. but low general storage availability caused the price to dip into the negatives anyways. same-same, but different. but interesting additional input from your side‚Äîthank you!', 'Tony', 'The problem with TP is that commercial paper is different from consumer paper. Usage shifted from commercial to consumer, and the factories couldn&#39;t retool fast enough.']

 problems in the stock markets only occur when you where rised in a socialistic country and therefore got indoctrinated that you absolutely must interfere with the free market in order to get the result you want. it&#39;s kinda like a similar flaw in thinking as to why interfering with the natural process of human creation in order to produce more preferable so called, &quot;designer babies.&quot;<br><br>in reality, as soon as you introduce artificial imbalances into a perfectly self-calibrating system, you end up in an endless game of whack-a-mole.

 here&#39;s my take regarding collective intelligence among the studio audience on, &quot;who wants to be a millionaire?&quot;<br><br>when the correct answer gets voted for by a significant number is people, you&#39;d expect a somewhat evenly distribution of votes among the remaining wrong ones. if, however, this isn&#39;t the case, there&#39;s very good reasons as to why that might be. so, a, &quot;40-20-20-20‚Äú voting result means, it was a difficult question, but those that didn&#39;t know the answer to picked the wrong one evenly distributed‚Äîall good! &quot;45-35-10-10&quot; on the other hand however means, &quot;why would a wrong answer amass significantly more votes than other wrong answers?&quot; that&#39;s for a very good reason, in almost all cases!

 People with higher intelligence and education tend to have less time for raising children, resulting in a smaller proportion of them in the population over time. However, this should not be a cause for distress as it is not something that can be changed or controlled. 

 	Replies: ["Riemann's Last Theorem", '@Phil Harmer True . What I meant to convey is that within a single species, different groups of individuals may follow different reproductive strategies. These strategies involve a balance between the number of offspring produced and the amount of investment given to each offspring. However, because of the social structures and support systems in human societies, the chance of survival for the next generation is generally similar regardless of the reproductive strategy followed by their parents. This means that even if intelligent people have fewer children, their offspring are not necessarily more likely to survive than the offspring of less intelligent people who have more children. So, if some people do not have any children while others have many, this can have a significant impact on the population dynamics and the distribution of traits within the population. Please note that I do not wish for this to be the case and I hoped that it was not true. I have a problem that I‚Äôm trying to find root cause and how to solve it.', 'Phil Harmer', 'True . <br>But those couples that have the wealth , they have the time .']

 &quot;Broadly speaking, the reason large groups are better than individuals in answering simple questions is that some people in the group are knowledgeable about the topic and the rest make errors that average out.&quot;<br><br>This explanation is a bit troublesome as it suggests the need for expertise within the group. In fact, one of the key insights of the wisdom of crowds is that a diverse group of individuals with different perspectives and levels of expertise can often outperform a group of experts in certain cases. While it is true that some individuals within a large group may be more knowledgeable about a given topic, the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; is not solely reliant on these individuals to arrive at accurate predictions. Instead, it depends on the collective contributions of all members of the group, including those who may be less knowledgeable or experienced, to arrive at a more accurate and reliable result. In some cases, individuals with less knowledge or experience may be able to provide fresh perspectives or alternative solutions that more knowledgeable individuals may have overlooked.

 Securitized mortgage pools may not have been inherently illegal per se, but at least under US UCC security laws, they voided the security interests of pooled mortgages, and did so in ways amounting to criminal and civil frauds, under laws US courts and politicians helped perpetrators evade rather than honestly enforce, in order to avoid &quot;interesting&quot; issues of banks and their asset buyers owning mortgages that could not be foreclosed legitimately.  Had our courts acted honestly, the scammers playing those games, including pension funds and secondary institutional investors, should have been allowed to collapse holding invalid notes, while homeowners retained valid title that couldn&#39;t be foreclosed, but was also stuck in limbo until any process to remove invalid security interests were voided.  But, government scam systems bailed out corrupt systems, while that whole mess was too complicated for the average voter to sort out, even on the public law aspects, never mind the privately concealed details.  That raises questions of what legal competency or majority mean?  <br><br>A counterpart is debt for equity securities/credit swaps, which are not inherently illegal or fraudulent under complex US laws, so long as they&#39;re not based on fraudulent valuations as &quot;Small hands&quot; Donnie Drumpf criminal accounting and brand promotional claims were.  The recent indictments cover many issues that were known before the election where Hillary also belonged in prison, but over three sets of official crimes, where if US courts were honest, would not have reversed a laundry list of felony convictions by former VA Gov McDonnell, not on the basis that facts were not proven at trial, nor that law was invalid, but under the SCOTUS scam that if they upheld that law honestly, corrupt political systems would overload courts with messy cases of similar but less severe or well proven facts.  <br><br>When US tax or securities laws are at play, there&#39;s also the elephant behind the curtain, where Bill Benson et al have well documented how the very existence of the IRS is a fraud, while HFT and other more complex micro-timing strategies are fundamentally at odds with the idea that securities exchanges are open to visible and honest information for trades among human entities, not devious circumvention algorithms Quants can&#39;t even fully explain.  <br><br>It&#39;s one thing if reality is complex and taxes human faculties....  where our society needs more functional coping systems.  It&#39;s quite another when that reality is scammed by big institutional industries and spot players within them, in ways that are demonstrable frauds, even if complex and hard to document ones.

 Collective stupidity can be countered by each individual with several mechanisms that I can derive from history: The predominant is having a broad base of general knowledge to draw from. The next is a mindset that scrutinizes the possible solutions that are proposed to address problems - for flaws. In other words: A problem arises and solutions are considered. Then those proposed solutions are attacked logically before implementation. Those that survive a well executed &quot;what if&quot; attack are likely to be good solutions that will last. The so-called &quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot; rarely involves such scrutiny which is why mass psychosis often comes upon them. Bad information gets into the general public psyche where it gets repeated &amp; taken as fact merely due to the &quot;everyone knows&quot; phenomena.  The next thing you know, &quot;blood-letting&quot; is a thing. Ask people &quot;off the street&quot; today where money comes from &amp; most won&#39;t even be able to begin to articulate the origins for something they use regularly.

 Arrogance can give over abundance of self belief that your answer is correct and everyone else is wrong. For a scientist this is very bad. More humility is needed and the ability to acknowledge your answer may be wrong. It will be interesting to see if AI will offer levels of uncertainty with any responses it gives.

 In an episode devoted to &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;bad&quot; decision making and the factors that may impinge on the process, the ideas of indoctrination and authority figures were left out. Billions of people believe in angels, saints, gods and a plethora of things that don&#39;t exist because they have had such nutty stuff drilled into them from birth. Others find legitimacy in such beliefs, which are among the most important in anyone&#39;s life, in the fact that highly respected figures such as the Pope and the President of the United States, and even disrespected figures, but nonetheless powerful, like Putin, put their faith on display. Can your parents and all of these famous people be wrong? Yes. History is loaded with examples, one of them being the belief the earth was flat. Billions of people alive right now base their decisions on holy texts, sermons, and various testimonies, revelations and miracles. Absolutely none of it can be demonstrated or proven. None. Of. It. It would have been interesting had you confronted this phenomenon, but in today&#39;s political climate, if you say that religion is a lot of nonsense, you get labeled intolerant or worse. On the other hand, there must be people to point out that the emperor has no clothes (which is a great example of collective stupidity). If billions can believe in the extravagant absurdities of religion, as they have for millennia, the internet is not to blame, and all that goes with it (social media, likes, etc.). Instead, the root causes of this widespread stupidity is the fear of death and of the lack of meaning in life. People, humans, are so fragile that they will disregard reason in the face of a random universe and a limited life span. If the wacky beliefs they adopt are then affirmed by authoritative figures, from parents to presidents and supported by indoctrination, well, that&#39;s a powerful package to keep people stupid. As John Lennon wrote in &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;&quot; &quot;Keep you doped with religion and sex and tv; and you think you&#39;re so clever and classless and free; but you&#39;re still fucking peasants as far as I can see.&quot;

 What makes one group more intelligent and another more stupid? Ideology. If you are in a group whose collective ideology is to be governed by facts, evidence, logic, reason, and devoted to rationality, then you&#39;re in the more intelligent group. If on the other hand, your group&#39;s collective ideology is to ignore facts, evidence, logic and reason in favor of magical thinking, polar thinking, and dogma, and your group rejects rationality in favor of emotionalism, and faith-based beliefs, then you&#39;re in the stupid group. So this second category would include all Leftists and all religious people. 

 	Replies: ['Tony', '@Julian Cate\xa0 good luck out there. I&#39;m not sure what camp Sabine is in, but she didn&#39;t do here homework on the Special Relativity/time-dilation/twin paradox video. I think it boils down to the belief that atomic clocks are measuring time and that the forces that accelerate the hands of the clock are the same forces that accelerate biological processes. There is a difference in matter - animal, mineral, and vegetable. Clocks are accelerated by a constant energy source in which the applied force is affected by motion. Plants are accelerated by sunlight in which the applied force is affected by cloud cover and temperature. Animals forage for their energy source and store the excess so it is available on demand. A click in motion runs slower because it&#39;s energy constrained. Plants grow slower because of sunlight, and animals grow slower because of the plants and animals it consumes.', 'Julian Cate', '@Tony Alright. Let me look into some of the things you mentioned and I&#39;ll get back. As an aside, I share your skepticism about many claims made in Cosmology and other fields, but I&#39;m a layman. In order to have more than just skepticism, you need a basic understanding of the matter at hand. Otherwise you cannot engage is serious critical thought. For example, I remain skeptical of Dark Matter and the Inflation theory, but I lack the expe4rtise to offer any meaningful criticism other than to say that it sounds like a convenient explanation to explain a phenomena that they really don&#39;t understand. Like Ptolemy&#39;s epicycles, it appeared to explain the issue perfectly and it was perfectly wrong.', 'Tony', '@Julian Cate\xa0 at its core, what is religion? A set of beliefs shared by the community? What is relativity, time-dilation, and length contraction? A set of theories (beliefs) held by the theoretical physics community. Nobody in the applied science community shares these beliefs. They have no basis in nature. In science, what happens something created in the lab doesn&#39;t work in practice. You discard it. In religion, what happens when one of your beliefs doesn&#39;t come true? You make up excuses why it doesn&#39;t work in this particular instance. <br>What do theoretical physicists do when one of their beliefs doesn&#39;t come true. They make up excuses as to why it doesn&#39;t apply. Have you ever heard the excuse, it doesn&#39;t come into play until you reach relativistic speeds? They can measure acceleration to a fraction of a millimeter and yet time-dilation doesn&#39;t occur until you are traveling at the speed of light. Which, by the way, is an impossibility, so there is no way to prove them wrong. <br>Hafele-Keating proved time-dilation wrong when it failed to show any change in the amount of energy consumed. Proving that clocks measure acceleration, not time. When they got caught on that, they pushed the muon time-dilation. A particle with greater mass energy, created deeper in the atmosphere, encountering a less dense column of air, is naturally going to show up alive and well at location closer to the ground than it&#39;s buddies. It&#39;s no different than arrows being fired and penetrating a backstop at different depths. <br>The clincher is accelerating particles to the speed of light and then claiming time-dilation because they last longer. This observation then gets applied to all particles/atoms/living cells. And yet, not once have they kept a seed from germinating or an egg from hatching simply by flying it around the earth faster than the earth rotates. <br>One excuse after another, incomplete experiments, misinterpreted data. Refusal to accept reality. If that doesn&#39;t classify as a religion, what does?', 'Julian Cate', '@Tony Curious. What evidence do you have about this branch of physics that makes you think it&#39;s a religion. Also, why are you watching this channel? I think Dr. Hossenfelder&#39;s background is particle physics, but she speaks about the latest news in all branches of physics including theoretical physics. So it doesn&#39;t seem rational to dismiss a branch of physics as a faith-based religion and then watch a channel that covers that branch of physics.', 'Tony', 'You can add theoretical physicists to that last group. Biggest bunch of faith-based religious zealots if there ever was one.']

 A correction is needed here: it was Dr Zimbardo at Stanford University who, in 1971, implemented the famous Stanford Prison Experiment. The Milgram Experiment, first implemented in 1961 and running for 3 months, tested the influence of authority on its subjects as well. However, its method was the assumed administration of electric shock onto a recipient in another room. He showed that 65% of subjects were obedient in increasing the volts to the full amount, despite the screams of the (assumed) recipient in the other room. In his paper in 1974, he states that ‚Äúauthority won more often than not‚Äù, which is similar to the results of Dr Zimbardo‚Äôs study. Collective stupidity? Yes.

Be it earning money, or co operation or family values or subjection to the state..   <br><br>And then these bad drivers turn up on the internet,  and you notice patterns..  but those patterns are not the cause..  lack of scientific and psychological, spiritual understanding is not innate to people.   And not innate to the internet, although it would be convenient if it where so..  most of the time people are within their daily lives, living offline..   and a large portion of people has barely any internet presence..   more than  a billion people around the world can barely have a good meal let alone discuss physics or enjoy watching videos..    this is why i keep repeating the internet as a whole with all its talent and intelligent people exists within a bubble..    it offers a fake sense of globalism..   and we are all part of this bubble the moment we post something online..    all internet knowledge is indirect knowledge..   so whatever you do just reinforces the bubble..   it does not make people more scientific..  but if they are intelligent, it may give them courage, to experiment, and look deeper...     So the primary focus should not be to improve the internet, to regulate behavior through it, to ban those who do not fit..  to create negative or positive prisons, creating this constant tension which is the norm in most organisations...     The focus should be human intelligence!     From the beginning, we should not teach children wrongly, authoritatively...     Instead of nourishing a stupid cunning, a stubborn attachment to so called facts  we should nourish their intelligence, compassion, curiosity, rebelliousness, ..   we want the younger generations not just to be as strong as us, but go beyond even!   We dont want them to be emprisoned in our traditions, not even the &#39;good&#39; ones..  because life is in a flux..  to force tradition is anti life!   If they are intelligent they will keep what is beneficial to the circumstances, and leave all that which increases misery in the world...    Even if it means leaving behind our current understanding of politics, religion, science, art...   All the good that exists in these fields has formed in spite of tradition.    These traditions integrated the symbols, but left the source behind, the creativity, the rebelliousness...     Great talent is rare..   but the status quo is trained to diminish great talent, to consume it or defeat it, and get back to business as usual..<br><br>Tradition is usefull, but sooner or later it becomes a burdon, ritualistic, a series of empty gestures. just because it happened in the past!<br>These rituals are justified by the very flowers that were destroyed by them..      <br>And then we are surprised the garden does not flourish..<br>A good gardener does not dictate his plants..  he looks to understand them how they relate to each other, to their eco presence..  how he can intehgrate within the garden and its creativity..    the best leaders are those who know how to surrender!   He does not push or pull the flowers..  he nourishes them if necessary ..  but eventually he wants to loose..  so the garden can grow even when he is not there

 I think the main reason for economic bubbles is not stupidity, but speculation. It&#39;s called the greater fool principle. Usually when some stock or something else is greatly overvalued, investors already know this, but they think that there will be a &quot;greater fool&quot; who will be ready to pay even more for it.<br><br>I think it comes most clear when we use examples outside the stock market, like the tulip mania (everyone knows that a tulip bulb isn&#39;t actually worth more than a  house, but people paid more than the value of a house) or the modern art market (everybody knows that no painting is actually worth 450 million $, but still in 2017 the painting &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci was sold for that price).

 Collective awareness of common opinions also leads to biased views on history. There are many issues about the narrative on the world wars of the 20th century that would not hold up in an unbiased court of law, if the rationally discerned facts would have been presented according to unbiased scrutiny. However, that is not how historiography works for that part. Much of that is shrouded in a taboo, prescribing an intended narrative that prevents the scrutiny of details that could jeopardize that same narrative.<br>The first response to any of those, presenting inconvenient issues, is to marginalize and ostracize them, whilst mocking their display of inconvenient facts. This part of history has been sensitized to an extent that unbiased scrutiny has become socially banned, leaving no wiggle room. Especially in Germany and Austria, laws have been cemented that prevent any display of those issues, other than the allowed response by the authorities and socially and politically established parties.<br>In some ways, freedom of fact-finding and opinion in western societies is not as obvious as it may seem.

 Bryan Caplan wrote a compelling book: &quot;The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies&quot;. It states that people in general are biased, so that democratic vote is not giving us the result of collective intelligence, but of collective stupidity. The rationale behind democratic vote is that the majority of people vote randomly wrong, but this randomness will cancel itself out, so that the few intelligently voting people make the difference and decide the vote in the end. Caplan shows that this concept does not work and that the majority is biased, effectively shifting the vote result towards wrong decisions.

 Sabine&#39;s rationale for the &quot;wisdom&quot; of crowds is fundamentally incorrect. Sabine assumes the reason crowds get it right is because the majority of crowd members make mistakes that cancel each other out, thus allowing for the opinion of the few knowledgeable members of the crowd to stand out. This is incorrect because it assumes the mistakes of the non-knowledgeable members of the crowd cancel each other about a zero (null) mean, which is not the case. The reason the crowd&#39;s opinion doesn&#39;t clobber the opinion of experts is because the error cancellation happens about the correct mean. This means that, on average, &quot;uninformed&quot; crowds have true knowledge, and this makes this problem even more fascinating.

To theorize that nothing is between those levels is a leap of faith, like Kierkegaard, who heavily influenced Bohr. So they&#39;ve reduced reality to probabilities.<br>&quot;There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of<br>physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature.&quot;       Niels Bohr.']

 Thank you. Very interesting. I at one time (and for quite a long time) worked for a government agency and never ceased to wonder at the herd behavior around me. So much so I gradually learned not to let my opinions out for fear of being called out as &quot;contrarian&quot;. And thereby I myself contributed to the herd behavior. Do some institutions (like the military perhaps?) run better with herd behavior, while others (one hopes for NASA) work better by allowing the voicing of dissenting ideas and opinions? 

 	Replies: ['Andrew Sprague', 'Yes and No.  The Greatest Generals of all time literally did the opposite.  Instead of pure herd behavior they would give far more control to smaller groups of units.  Napoleon for example.  And he crushed everyone by doing this.  So yes you need Discipline.  But too much herd behavior leads to stuff like WWI insanity.  With the most horrible decisions being made over and over.  Many cases of this when War was more &quot;Honorable&quot; and people stood in lines shooting at each other.  <br><br>So pretty much if your Herd Behavior seeps into your Leadership what so ever your kinda screwed.  Best Generals always seem to not want to listen to leadership.  Patton was always pissed if leadership didn&#39;t let him do what he wanted.  And he was the best.  Like dude was next level.  If even heard your unit was in trouble he would turn and save you instantly against orders.<br><br>I think we are far too Intelligent now for Herd Behavior to have any advantage any more.  And it caters to states like Russia.  Where you need to send 50k to their death to meet your goal.  If Patton was alive right now he would be raging so hard about Russia.  So in my opinion Herd Behavior is a weakness and fosters negative opinions about education and critical thinking which are key in Modern War.']

Maybe in the past, if the Universe came from a near singularity. Take any circle and expand it long enough, it flattens out to all intents and purposes.<br>Thinking there are singularities in the physical word- not just a dot on paper- is another sign of stupidity.

 brain cells also create logical circuits. a collective response from a set of particles is just an established wave of longer frequency. What exists all around is waves. Particles are waves. The sea waves you show... a grid of stationary waves is shown, that is created from the sea reaching the shore. That grid is made from the longer waves that come from the open. The same thing occurs in the universe. An ELF wave of extremely low frequency sets the boundaries of the bubble. It is measured in LY. Bring the infinity symbol in your mind. Isn&#39;t it a stationary wave?

 The majority of the population of the planet has an unhealthy lack of understanding in it, combined with an unhealthy level of real and fake information in it.  The two things combined affect decision making so much that healthy people are making decisions that only a person with brain damage or sickness would make.  Let me give you an example.   A healthy person would never make the decision to put their lifes future into the hands of someone who is mentally not well.  They would never do that.  It is unthinkable for someone who is mentally heaalthy to make that decision.  However in the US the population elected Donald Trump, who apart from everything else is a climate change denier.  He is someone who has so little understanding in his head that he does not expect climate change, which is what any mentally healthy person should be doing.<br><br>In other countries the same decisions have been made when selecting government representatives the people that the populations have elected by majority have been people who are clearly mentally not well.  Obviouslky this condition is far reaching and has too many problems to talk about here.<br><br>The reason this is happening is because the simple equation for education that must be maintained in perfect balamce some how dissapeaared from the planet.  The equation is &quot;1 part information added to 1 part understanding to produce 1 part knowledge which includes understanding.  When the equation gets out of balamce the way is has on Earth, people become more and more paranoid, scared, agressive, unpredictabloe and are highly suseptable to believing very stupid things.  When you increase understanding, paranoia, fear, agression unpredictability and suseptability to believing crazy ideas dissapear.<br><br>The effects are obvious, the cause is obvious, and yet because that equation is somehow missing the educators of the world think everything is ok because children adapted and can pass exams without the need for high levels of understanding when all they need is the correct answer to whateverthe quesion is.  Understanding the answer is not necesary to get the answer xorrect and pass yoour exam.<br><br>Unless this catastrophic failure of the current system is fixed the number of mentally healthy people on the planet with a satisfactory level of understanding will be so insignificant that the majority will make the minority extinct because they will be an insermountable force up against an insignificantly small immovable object.

 Its quite amazing that you understand the problems without recognizing your own &quot;egocentric bias&quot; is perpetuating misinformation to others, which is the topic of your own video!

More competition, less likelihood of monopolies and if they do form, its a gift and will soon disappear (netflix) 2. The dotcom, housing/ financial crisis and our current financial crisis are byproducts of artificial suppression of interest rates and deficit spending by governments. The bankers could not have blown these bubbles if the federal banks did not print the money first. The source of the problem is better to blame.

Some people just want it all now or seek to attack people for whatever reason. Goal orientated society... with objective reality. Stupid ideals that are destructive to the whole would be, all men are oppressive therefor use state power to abuse gender. Or tonal range this.. you then have a collective body harming innocent healthy bodies that don&#39;t follow such nonsense... so the collective jntelligence is in reality a credible honest environment, because lies slow down communication and relation to arbritste those relations. Ie starting people by accusing them of something they never did and then not allowing them to own or love would be an example of crime.. stupidity is everywhere... what is intelligence math, English... or the relation of reality to be made a new.. is it undermining and crime and dominance or destroying others ... hmm I mean groups constantly breakout and trend crazy things like, placenta eating absolute nonsense. Core j teligence is a unit of people that can make goals happen, but banks disrupt hairy constantly.. 90 percent of the world is built of scams and lies in a worldly sense then actual intelligence that leads to discoveries and understanding, most of the world today is built on harming the neighbour to get ahead by any means and call it modern.

 The examples on the stock markets could go further and are an illustration of a deep economic problem. How to organize a society so that the decisions are in the interest of the common good: free market or legislation (with the extreme being &quot;centralized economy&quot;)? More than often this is called &quot;politics&quot; and ignorants manage countries with dogmatic belief (republican or communist) into one or the other solution; when optimum depends on circumstances. Great post ! thank you ! (of course the commercial part is an exercise to identify information hum...)

 Dendritic behavior as in your mold example, it caused by undercooling.  This is a physical reaction, not a biological action.  The biological actors just follow along the structure formation.

 Social media information cascades certainly explains the absurd and counter-productive polarisation of social justice issues and hyper-ideological positions on both sides of the political spectrum. Social media may allow people to vent their views but it does not facilitate dialogue between those with differing views. Bit of a nightmare really.

 Public free parking in a residential neighbourhood that&#39;s close to a university is a good example.  Students will park the neighbourhood completely full such that the homeowners complain to their city council.  City Council then issues the homeowners parking passes and then puts up &quot;2 Hour Parking unless permit is displayed&quot; signs, and tows away offenders.  If the students had always left 10% of the parking empty, the homeowners would be relatively happy and likely would never have complained.  But now, none of the full-time students can park in that area at all.  So it&#39;s now 90% empty.  Collective stupidity for sure.

Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips... continue the list as long as desired.&quot; (p. 8).<br>So, we don&#39;t need fossil evidence...handy, because there isn&#39;t any, for inter-speciation.<br> Richard thinks the genes are all-powerful; he hasn&#39;t heard of epigenetics, then.<br>‚ÄúAlthough the heads, hearts, eyes, etc., of insects, vertebrates and other creatures carry out analogous functions, neither their<br>developmental morphogenesis nor functional anatomies are actually very similar if considered in any detail.&quot; Biologists Douglas Erwin and Eric Davidson on genes like distal-less (or Dlx) and Pax-6, ( which function as a switch, but in each case a switch that regulates many different downstream genes, leading to different anatomical features, depending upon the larger informational context in which the gene finds itself. ) ‚ÄúThe Last Common Bilaterian Ancestor.‚Äù <br>This is what I mean when I say it&#39;s the location that&#39;s important in SNPs. nONE OF THIS IS EVOLUTIONARY, in the sense of change in alleles.

 Groupthink - not the same thing as herd behaviour - is a great generator of collective stupidity in groups of otherwise well-educated and intelligent people. Many groups in the the professions and big business are composed of members who have had very similar educations and life experiences. They tend to hold assumptions in common; and the more common the assumption, the more likely it is to be held unconsciously by the individuals, and never queried within the group.  Groupthink has been blamed - among other things - for the inability of highly informed financial professionals to anticipate &#39;black swan&#39; events - rare but disastrous - in the global financial system.

 To claim to be all about science and then just using an ableist and saneist concept like &quot;stupidty&quot; as if it was self-evidently valid is bit of an embarrassment, tbh.<br>It strongly suggests that you have not done the work to reflect on how science culture and the perspective of scientists is very much entangled with the history of eugenics and supremacist ideas, no matter what lip service is paid to egalitarianism and objectivity.

 An important cause of collective stupidity is that the shallow thinking and quick talking types often arrive at an (often wrong) answer first and present it with confidence. Deep thinkers, who consider many more aspects of an issue, often come up with better and more complete answers that include a description of avoided caveats as well as reservations about the domain in which their answer is valid. Or they might conclude that, with the available information, a question can&#39;t be answered at all. Unfortunately herd behavior makes people who have no clue follow the shallow but quick and (over)confident types. One might wonder to what extent this is a cultural effect or whether people are biologically susceptible to errors and fraud.

 Sabina, OK, the reason we are in our gaseous state was what why didn&#39;t this happen before? Because it couldn&#39;t, the gases were in a different form. The vacuum is vibrating NO EMFS. I believe frozen, and as the frozen universe thawed, it releases gases more thaw more gases more space. Until there&#39;s enough space and gases in the (vacuum) space for the vibrating universe to clump the molecule sticking together to produce the fusion process. There&#39;s no EMFS until the frozen hydrogen particles are broken down to the gaseous state. That&#39;s why this is the 3rd stage of our universe, the final stage. No expansion gas off. That&#39;s why blacksphere are born to get rid of the hydrogen particles to burn the hydrogen off. At every stage of the process, the goal is to get rid of the gases. Even humans we love to burn the gases it&#39;s hardwired into our very being. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here. Something happened the vacuum felt the hydrogen the balance was off, so it&#39;s correcting itself. Just like planets when something gets messed up a planet, snowballs, to correct the issue.  Same thing with the vacuum space it&#39;s correcting itself, and we&#39;re a result of this. You can see the same result across the entire universe. It&#39;s not an accident it&#39;s a correction. Equivalence is the goal. It sounds ugly now, but as it grows into what we see, it turns out to be beautiful. After 3rd generation stars, the process becomes random for star making as this is the point the process ramps up. And we see all types of stars like ours. The EMFS aren&#39;t there until the gases are clumped once enough have gathered, and the charge is big enough that the fusion process can begin. Everywhere it can and this matches up to the cmb beautifully. The best part is that it still might be happening. we might get a chance to see this process off in the vacuum. It&#39;s the vacuum that created those first stars. Blacksphere ‚ö´Ô∏è have 1 job nothing goes in they build galacty that&#39;s it. No Gravity needed whatsoever anywhere. VEM= 0Msquared. Objects have no barring on the Vacuum Energy space the equivalence principle is met. As all objects in the vacuum retain the vacuums energy mass value which is 0Msquared. It&#39;s cool and it&#39;s correct, questions Sabina?

 The CDO market here in the US was a combination of banks going out on a limb and at the same time repackaging risk is such complicated financial devices it would require a bunch of physicists and mathematicians to understand the risk. <br><br>   One of the banks who I will not name greatly benefitted from the collapse of the financial system because they were creating these instruments, knew the risk, where repackaging them and selling them. They knew the system was about to disentigrate and they chose to sell all their instruments and able to then buy up pieces of broken banks at pennies on the dollar after the collapse. So we cannot state noone understood the system, people understood the system, its just the federal regulators and congressmen we paid to regulate and understand the system did not understand the system.  <br><br>At the time we had a federal reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who was a &quot;markets correct themselves&quot; economist. But as the situation progressed he failed to understand that the real estate investment market had developed a means of unwittingly killing itself. Had he acted more cautiously he could have raised interest rates, and tightened the money supply a bit. But he did not. This all stems from years of loosening the banking restrictions which allowed banks to dabble in the capital markets as opposed to lending and banking of money. <br><br>If we look at the 2008 financial collapse it has its beginnings around 2003, that is to say Banks were trying to figure out how to game a evolving legal/political system and it took time for the laws to change enough and for thinking in that new system of laws to develop a positive sum game (which are always transient phenomena). To pit it like this, there are only so many houses, so many building supplies, construction worker, new construction inspectors. . . As more houses are built than a stable market can support, the price of each house goes up, as the demand curve shifts up by this greed, since the supply line of timber, copper wire and insulation reaches near-term production limits the prices double or triple. This naturally controls price, the lender realizes the home is too overvalued and they deny the loan. The flaw in the system is to presume that banks were not efficient at lending money, that by repackaging and selling debt the banks would become more efficient. This is more or less like tying every stick of dynamite in north america to the same fuse and arguing there is such a low risk that one stick of dynamite would explode the systemic risk was minimal. <br>    But in 2008 the fuses were lit an no one knew it. At the end of 2007 the increase in material production was driving up commodity prices in many sectors, but industrial analysis noted that in many areas oil production began declining. People began predicting an oil price spike above 150$ per barrel, there were investors betting against this, this resulted in a speculation war in Commodity markets and Goldman Sacs would eventually take the prize. As prices climbed over 100$ per barrel in spring of 2008 and headed for 150$ in June a sense of panick began to overtake the financial markets. <br>   Here is the reason, the CDO and like investments were not so much a holding but a process for banks and investment houses. They made money through processing debt, that all worked as long as there was an, quoting Alan Greenspan, an irrational exuberance in the real estate market and an assumed purchaser of risk everpresent.  But high oil prices meant already exoensive copper and aluminum was going to skyrocket, transportation costs would skyrocket. House prices were going to go to such a point questions began to sufficate the exuberance. Some banks saw this coming and sold all their &#39;new age&#39; instruments, but unfortunately other financial institutes were buying these. As you had to hold the instrument before you could repackage and sell it, the moment came in the summer of 2008 were noone wanted to buy and everyone wanted to sell. <br>   We have to think about this debt, I agree to pay you 9% if you loan me a dollar, over tye life of 30 years I agree to pay you two dollar more. So that debt in 30 years is worth 2 dollars. If I take that debt and cut it into 5 pieces I can sell it, not for the dollar i paid fir it, but a 1.20, that means the next buyer is going to get less interest. He then takes 5 units containg my debt chops then by five units each and he sells it for a dollar and forty four cents. The buyer of that debt, still with the same overall risk, is going to make less interest than the orevioys owner. So that the buyers of these repacked instruments were paying more money for prigressively lower future value. But that would make logical market sense if the buyers understood the product. Noone understood, short of some biostaticians and physicist working way outside their area of expertise, these instruments. These gurus were not in boardrooms but hidden from inspection in cubicles of major financial institutions. The result was if few of the debtors failed to meet their debt obligation the markets had a momentum, but once people could not pay bills, others started asking who owned the debt. And when people looked they found that even if the debts were paid, the CDOs were not worth much anyway. <br>   As this occurred the dirty little secret could not be held because some investments houses were teetering on daily sales revenue just to survive to the next day. When that happened institutions closed their doors, this created fear, people began selling risk, within about a month something that was worth a dollar soon beacame worth three cents, and traditional investors were screwed also, because when bankruptcy occurs the common stock investors are at the back of the line for who gets the scraps. The price of financial investment stock plummetted. As fear grew it spread, home builders stopped building, US low end truck market went into a freefall, you could buy a 50,000$ truck for 10,000 dollars. People were walking out of homes to live in a vehicles that the bank owned and they could no longer debt service. Alan greenspan came to admit that he did not understand the underpinning of the instability at the time. <br><br>And so the question is what in nature isn&#39;t emmergent and what is the nature of fluctuations that propogate? Here in lies the question does a physical reality exist. If we look at the basis of reality we either conclude that it is wave-like feild of general relativity or quantum based feild of quantum mechanics. <br>   There is a critical problem with our universe that the basis of reality is self propogating, space expands. In the beginning space expanded and energy appeared in that space, fields stabilized and the roar of energy in the fields quietened to fluctuations that became our physical reality. There was a period of great order and instability. The universe was this &quot;state&quot; that then became a bunch of new emergent phenomena with increasingly lower energy densities. We are ordered chaos. <br>    The nature of the initial state has a drive to order in lower energy density we call entropy, but the nature of entropy is enigmatic, because what drives space to expand when at some previous point it was not expanding. We understand that statistics drives particles to redistribute in empty space, but we dont know why space can expand or how it does so. So everything in space is an emmergent property in space because if space stopped expanding say at 10-32 sec after inflation stopped, our reality would not have emerged. There would have been a physical state, it would simply represent physical properties we can only guess at. So that state and all the properties of that state are emergent and out current universe and all the properties of this universe are emergent. <br><br>   If that is not mind boggling enough, we only need to step a portion of that 10E-32 second back in time and reask the question what is emergent as time itself appears to be an emergent property of events within space. We can get to a property of space in such a state were space does not expand and time does not emerge. When did the universe flip the emergent switch on and why? How can there be a when before time?<br><br>Way back there when people were grappling with the divine, each group was trying to promote their divine being, the bigger the empire, the more powerful the being. Among the twists a smallish group of independence seeking people grappled with the idea of their god born out of a much older system whose properties evolved as they tried to establish their theological independence, it came to the point the answer was &quot;it exists and never you mind&quot;. That is to say, dont ask about origins its a messy businesss. But philosophically they are born of an outpost, defended by a god of trade, a point in a system of wealth by trade, which even in the LBAC has to go on (i.e. judges). Their divine was to bring order to chaos, its simply never enough as they needed &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;. Religion emerges. <br><br>The point is systemically reality exists, we may not know the cause but that is enough to understand that functionality. Living in a functional reality suffices without needing to know the underlying state. Intelligent people, i could name a physicist or two, often leverage what they know into sophistry, a bubble that a critical child could pop. It reminds me of an old woman, sitting on the chair outside her cabin just after Katrina. The reporter was asking her all kinds of questions, as if to bring meaning to her of the disater in new Orleans, but her simpler reality was immune from thier big city troubles. She might not know what we know, but what she kniws is how to survive under without all the sophist trappings.

 This is the reason that freedom of speech is so precious.<br>In any population, exactly half of the members will be of below average intelligence.<br>If a condition is established that encourages the least intelligent portion of the group to punish the more intelligent members, the more intelligent members opinions will gradually be excluded leaving the idiots free to impose their narrative unopposed.<br><br>YT has become a great example of this. YT punishes and removes opinions that challenge ridiculous narratives like gender being a spectrum while any biology first year student understands that there are only two gamates and that gender is necessarily limited to either &quot;those who produce ova&quot; and &quot;those who produce $p3rm.&quot;<br><br>Cosmetic surgery will never change that simple biological fact.<br><br>Suppressing this fact prevents both sides of it from being able to weed out the silly bits and it is as though preference has been given to flat earth magical thinkers rather than disappoint them and hurting their feelings while correcting them and making them smarter in the process.

 <b>The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity</b> (Carlo Cipolla). <br>Economic historian Carlo Cipolla wrote a blessedly short book called <b>The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity</b> (which Nassim Nicholas Taleb raves about). Five basic laws are enunciated:<br>	1.	Always and inevitably, <b>everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation</b><br>	2.	The <b>probability that a certain person (will) be stupid is independent of any other characteristic</b> of that person<br>	3.	A <b>stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain</b> and even possibly incurring losses<br>	4.	<b>Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals.</b> In particular, non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places, and under any circumstances, <b>to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake</b><br>	5.	<b>A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person</b><br><br>These led to the formation of a useful tool of reflection, the <b>Stupidity Matrix</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_M._Cipolla">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_M._Cipolla</a> constructed with 2 axes: <br><br>x-axis: Benefits and losses that <b>an individual causes to themselves</b><br>y-axis: Benefits and losses that <b>an individual causes to others</b><br><br>From these two factors we obtain a matrix containing four groups of people <i>humorously illustrated</i> by James Donnelly here<br><a href="http://cantrip.org/stupidity.html">http://cantrip.org/stupidity.html</a><br><br>	‚Ä¢	The Intelligent 	[+/+]<br>	‚Ä¢	The Bandit 		[+/-]<br>	‚Ä¢	The Helpless 	[-/+]<br>	‚Ä¢	The Stupid 		[-/-]<br> <br><b>Intelligent people</b> contribute to society and leverage their contributions into personal benefits<br><b>Bandits</b> pursue their own self-interest even when this poses a net detriment to societal welfare<br><b>Helpless people</b> contribute to society but are taken advantage of by it<br><b>Stupid people</b> are counterproductive to both their and others&#39; interests<br><br>An additional category of <b>Ineffectual people</b> either exists in its own right or can be considered to be at the dead center (0-point) of the graph.<br><br>As a reflective tool - for perhaps addressing the Dunning-Kruger problem - it could be used to ask:<br>	1)	In which quadrant would you place yourself in Cipolla‚Äôs matrix? <br>	2)	In which quadrant would others who know you place you in Cipolla‚Äôs matrix? <br><br>Because stupidity has ramifying impacts upon society The Guardian news site also reported on the issue:<br><b>Improbable Research: the laws of human stupidity</b><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/09/improbable-research-human-stupidity">https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/09/improbable-research-human-stupidity</a><br><br>The Guardian nick-named the Dunning-Kruger Syndrome in honour of an Incompetent of the very highest order: David Brent (from Ricky Gervais‚Äôs The Office).<br><br>The David Brent syndrome<br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/04/research.highereducation">https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/04/research.highereducation</a><br><br>Finally, another Italian, Giancarlo Livraghi, a businessman and philosopher wrote extensively on the subject in his book <b>The Power of Stupidity</b> which he made into a website:<br><a href="http://www.gandalf.it/stupid/contents.htm">http://www.gandalf.it/stupid/contents.htm</a><br><br>We can temper all of the above with some interesting new research about <b>Collective Illusions</b> and how to overcome them from the research group Populace.<br><br><b><i>Research indisputably shows that ordinary Americans are not nearly so divided the way they are being constantly portrayed by the media.</i></b> You are no doubt aware that <b>anger, fear and division drive engagement and advertising dollars and thus gives a wholly skewed view of what people really think.</b> Very few people are stoking all this chaos but they have very loud and very persistent voices and they deliberately trigger the most sensitive to expand their reach.

 There is an aspect of defaulting mortgages that was not mentioned. It started back in the 1990&#39;s during the Clinton administration. The government threatened banks with legal action if they didn&#39;t make more mortgages in poorer communities, and most banks willingly accepted the assumed value of the premise, that not making those mortgages constituted a form of financial discrimination. The legal basis for this was the Community Reinvestment Act, passed in 1977. The result was more defaults, which led to the collapse of mortgage backed securities, which led to the other problems. Without the pressure from the government to make bad loans, the collapse would never have happened.

 I wonder if it would be possible to use collective intelligence and information cascading to wean humans off their use and dependence on money? Evidence from the last few thousand years of history would tend to indicate collective stupidity is by far the dominant factor in human affairs so the likelihood is we continue on our current path of self-destruction. Perhaps with the right intellectual seeds planted in the right way homo sapiens could live up to its aspirational title.  <br><br>Imagine if the resources currently being poured into the military industrial complex were instead applied to terraforming Mars and Venus? Fair to say that on our current level of ethical and moral development we&#39;d just end up in a state where we&#39;d trash 3 planets instead of just the one we&#39;re wrecking at the moment.

 You initial comments on stock markets are fundamentally flawed.  The people who drive the prices of shares are motivated by maximising their own returns and minimising the time taken to get those returns, these days taken to an extreme by so-called &quot;high speed trading&quot; which operates on timescales less than a second. This motivation is diametrically opposed to the interests of people who rely on the real sector (as opposed to the financial sector) for their incomes and supply of goods and services.

One important question to ask is: how do we acquire said information?<br>The simplified answer is: statistics. If you&#39;re an ant in a small population of ants living on the surface of the sun, how likely do you think that the information you get is nothing about food, or eggs, or a queen, and mostly just: HOT! HOT! HOT!<br>So, if you live in a city with people who have similar access to information, how likely is it that your information deviates wildly from that of everyone you interact with? Or in simpler terms: how likely is it that if Einstein hadn&#39;t been alive that no one else would&#39;ve come up with the same theories around the same time?<br><br>&quot;If I don&#39;t abuse this system for my own gain, someone else will, so I might as well abuse it.&quot;<br>&quot;If there&#39;s already junk here, I might as well add mine instead of taking the effort to give the right example and put in a little effort to throw my junk in the bin.&quot;<br><br>Common excuses and poor ones. Your peers and the generations after them follow the same logic and are encouraged to if you give the examples. If instead you were to give the example of pointing out and (helping to) fix(ing) flaws that can be abused so that a system no longer encourages abuse but long term population wide beneficial use, you would be giving a very different example that can be applied to many things in people&#39;s lives.<br>For instance, it encourages you to empathize and think in longer term solutions where you have to work less for more benefit because the population then does all the work for you and being an individual in a population you still benefit from it and instead of having to worry that your abuse might end or backfire, you can be confident that the system strengthens and amplifies itself by encouraging people to behave toward its and each other&#39;s benefit.<br>This is what I mean with: people don&#39;t understand statistics. People keep reminding each other that they can&#39;t change the world all by themselves. Yet, the world constantly changes and societies change, morality and ethics changes. So who does all that changing if not we?<br><br>Is the death penalty gone in most civilized countries because it&#39;s more profitable to keep people alive? Is murdering your neighbour and stealing all of his shit illegal because a god says so? Or might our behaviours be statistically dependent on our very nature of being social cooperative animals with complex brains and inner emotional lives and the information that we have access to and how our brains process that information?<br><br>So, to skip writing the rest of the book I&#39;ll never publish because I&#39;m not going to write it but someone else will and there will be many of such books basically saying the same things I am going to say here:<br>The social world is dependent on encouragement and discouragement and here we have a lot of decisions to make. What we should avoid is basing our decisions on too small sample sizes. If I am kind to a person and that person beats me up and steals my money, that wouldn&#39;t be a good reason to stop being kind. If I am kind to everyone who doesn&#39;t beat me up and steal my shit, I will be treated with kindness in return and benefit from that. If then my face gets remodeled and all my money gets stolen I can rely on kind people to help me out and maybe even warn me about certain people to help me prevent thanking a mobster for offering me protection for a subscription fee and taking up a job as drug runner to earn back the money I owe for protection.<br>&quot;If I don&#39;t take the offer, someone else will and crime will still exist; I change nothing by refusing the offer.&quot;<br><br>But you do change a lot by making the decision to go with it or turn your back to it. It&#39;s not just you who is affected by your choices. Your choices encourage others. The effects that happen to you will encourage or discourage others. How you deal with the effects encourages others to deal with effects in the same way. Your children are far more likely to smoke if you are a smoker. Your children are also far more likely to manipulate and rely on fallacies and thinking errors to make decisions if you express religiosity. Your children are also far more likely to clean up their shit and stay away from abusers like gods or other mobsters if you clean up your shit and are critical of people&#39;s words and actions and the consequences of those.<br><br>If I am not a good example to people, someone else will be, but they don&#39;t have my friends and family or their respective children and friends and families. If my friends are in trouble and I turn them away, will someone else be there for them? Probably. So the take away is no that we should or shouldn&#39;t do something, but that we don&#39;t have to move heaven and earth to do something. We&#39;re a social species - you are not the requirement for the species to function. But your choices do affect the futures of everyone.<br><br>What direction you want those futures to take is up to you. Just don&#39;t be surprised that if you are generally kind and helpful to people that they&#39;ll be there for you when you are in trouble and we all will be some times.<br>Who would you rather trust with helping you, a person you&#39;ve paid and have dirt on, or someone who helps you because they feel you deserve it and feel it does them good to be there for you? It will mean the world to them, and you thought you couldn&#39;t change it by yourself; evidently you can even change it in your weakest moments when you rely on others to do anything. All you need to do before that is to love and be loved in return.  Needing someone isn&#39;t a weakness - anyone who doesn&#39;t need anyone is the weakest.

 I love your videos, however your explanation of the 2008 financial crisis is excessively simplistic. I&#39;m not an expert in this, but, as I understand things, It wasn&#39;t just a matter of mortgages going bad and causing bond defaults. Giant insurance companies like AIG wrote insurance against the default of these bundled mortgages called &quot;credit default swaps&quot;which were then traded around like stocks. To compound the problem, and multiple swaps could be written on the same bond and you did not have to own the bond to take out the insurance. It&#39;s as if you had a life insurance policy and 10 other people took out policies on your life with the same insurance company. If you died earlier than expected, the insurance company might fail. When mortgages started defaulting it created a near logarithmic  cascade effect that couldn&#39;t be stopped. I suggest you watch the movie &quot;The Big Short.&quot;

 The shortest explanation is that collective stupidity is result of our herd instinct. It leads to tendency of conformity, which limits our behavior to a narrow set of collectively accepted behavior. <br>So basically a herd is a large set of very limited individuals. When I say behavior I also mean ideas and particularly sharing and discussing ideas open mindedly.<br>To be smarter often involves considering non-standard ideas, and if we&#39;re not sharing or not accepting others&#39; ideas we&#39;re just limiting ourselves as a group.<br>That applies even to ideas about socially unacceptable behavior, because in order to decide how to deal with such behavior better we need to be able to consider such ideas.<br><br>Take for example death penalty. Very few people actually like the idea itself, or like to think of the actions deserving potentially death penalty, or to consider the consequences of executing it.<br>But if we&#39;re not able to discuss these ideas without bias we&#39;re more likely to do lynches (as we know from experience judging socially unacceptable behavior even if not proven tend make a crowd behave quickly as a judge &amp; jury /esp. when actual law enforcement is inadequate/).<br><br>Smaller teams especially of people that are used to share &amp; discuss their ideas with each other tend to perform better (ie more intelligently), because they&#39;re not limited by the herd instinct conformity, but are contributing with each others&#39; unique ideas &amp; abilities. We tend to communicate better and more openly in smaller groups for many reasons, but one is that it&#39;s just much easier than communicating with hundreds of people; it&#39;s easier to get feedback from more (or all) members; smaller groups usually are difficult to average out, so we&#39;re more likely to pay attention to our differences rather than accepting that 3.5 is a valid outcome of a dice roll ;) <br>Confidence is important factor, that can help with communicating your ideas, but also on the flip side can make somebody&#39;s ideas dominate over the others.<br>In my college we were doing these so called Problem Based Learning, in which as a relatively small group we were trying to tackle some problem, brainstorm it, and deduct some possible solutions as a group. Important part was the ability to give any idea that comes to mind, incl. what might appear to be a stupid one (it&#39;s much easier to disregard stupid ideas, than getting new ones). And also each session we had to rotate on the role of a chair(wo)man, which was incredibly helpful to some shy people overcome their tendency to not-share their opinion, but also switched the dynamics each session so that even the most confident members didn&#39;t dominate much the collective analysis. <br>It was very good exercise!

 You use the example of aggressive dudes, or men, shouting down everyone in the room. But here in liberal Seattle, it‚Äôs usually aggressive women concerned about social justice that lead to an information cascade.

It‚Äôs a good example, but the phenomenon isn‚Äôt limited to one sex ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs been shown that women on average have better lingual skills than men.

Just make sure you avoid belligerence and hostility because that is what creates most of the collective stupidity as people line up to takes sides in the resulting conflict.  Step demanding people be either for you or against you.

We&#39;ll be collectively stupid, if you like that or not.&quot;  :) <br>There should be some sort of category about institutional stupidity or something; like what&#39;s taught is the &#39;right&#39; thing, and there&#39;s no acceptance of independent derivation of the same ideas : Lorentz Transform for example, which doesn&#39;t match reality.  <br>The equivalence principle is falsifiable - if you have a stationary (or nearly stationary) space, then that space, to a stationary or very fast moving observer still looks the same, and is not contracted; it&#39;s only when the space is also moving fast that a stationary or fast moving observer sees length expansion or contraction ( And say - what about that length expansion?  There are two sides to that).  But then reversing a fast moving observer and stationary space, then if the fast observer says he&#39;s at rest, then he would project that the space should appear contracted/expanded - but that&#39;s not what will be observed.  Only if you fully buy into the dream/hypothetical reality that Lorentz captured will it work... but seems like math that only works in an imaginary world isn&#39;t very practical for the real world.   <br>It&#39;s easy enough to derive the equations yourself - sans the gamma factor which can be applied later (there are reasons for clock to go slower towards the speed of light) - compute how long it takes for light to get from any point in a space, to be seen ( T_o = sqrt( DD + (VT+L)^2 /C ) - C is the speed of light - D is a distance from the observer (Lorentz forces this to be zero - so the train has to go through you), L is an offset in the observable body (also forced to zero so the reference of the moving frame is always just the center point).  If you keep those factors than you get the previous equation - you can even ask wolfram alpha to solve for T, and then you get ( T = ( sqrt( (T_oCV)^2 - (DV)^2 ) -LV ) / V ); but if you simplify the equation with D=0 and L=0 then you get ( T_o = sqrt( (VT)^2 ) /C ) which obviously just simplifies to T_o = VT/C; however this then starts giving the wrong answers - though, granted, the math is easier, it&#39;s also just wrong.

 I found this video well thought out, but I think the premise is misguided.  If you want to make &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more intelligent&quot; decisions, studying group dynamics like this isn&#39;t really going to help you.<br><br>Instead, you need to concentrate on the particular decision at hand.  You need to analyze the evidence.  Even having prejudices is fine, as long as you understand them.  Prejudices, intuition, gut instinct, etc... are really just time savers for us.  Sure, sometimes they can be wrong,  but for successful people they are much more often right - that&#39;s why they are successful.  Acting <b>first</b> is a huge advantage.  Being confident has the same advantages.<br><br>In the examples given here, the moral isn&#39;t that &quot;collective intelligence/stupidity&quot; is good or bad.  It&#39;s more about how many people don&#39;t bother analyzing evidence.  They don&#39;t spend the intellectual energy trying to understand what is happening or what their choices are.  Many people are simply lazy (or perhaps timid), and so they follow the crowd because it&#39;s easy.  And this isn&#39;t about &quot;intelligence&quot; (in the past few years we have seen many &quot;intelligent people&quot; become drones to the &quot;consensus&quot;).<br><br>Teach people how to think for themselves.  Teach them the true meaning of &quot;science&quot; (I.E. the scientific method).  Teach them that living life requires constant attention, skepticism and curiosity.

 Bees communicate through dance and frequency of wing beats. There was a study done, some 30 years ago using a Hewlett-Packard network/spectrum analyzer (I used to build, test, and repair them), where the wing beat frequency was measured and correlated to the distance/direction of a pollen target. Once the pattern was recognized, an artificial bee was created. Its wings were made to buzz at a particular frequency while it danced (roughly a figure 8) and all the bees would then fly right over a target with an actual reward  (targets were 100 meters apart) and they&#39;d land on the target with no reward.

 It appears to me that the real issue is not IQ but EQ. Think of it this way. &quot;Intelligence&quot; is just a tool, say a hammer. EQ (Emotional Quotient) determines how that tool will be used; whether it will be utilized constructively or destructively. When otherwise intelligent people do stupid things, more often than not it&#39;s an emotional/psychological failure than a temporary lapse of their IQ. Despite the seeming stupidity of their actions (having that extra drink and then getting behind the wheel), they&#39;re still just as intelligent; it was their EQ that wasn&#39;t up to snuff...

Thank you for your great work, I really enjoy the clarity of your presentations, and most especially, your sense of humor. <br><br>As an addendum to my comment above, my observation has been that quite often &quot;intelligent&quot; people are prone to using their IQ to rationalize very low EQ decisions. This is the poorest imaginable utilization of that which most essentially defines who we are - or, at least, who we should be - as human beings. Imagine if it were always our human intelligence which controlled our animal emotions, rather than vice versa. What a different, infinitely more pleasant world it would be! Unfortunately it seems that the zeitgeist of the reality we currently inhabit is modelled on exactly the opposite extreme; precious human IQ is harnessed in servitude to base animal emotions. The results are... well, read the headlines... üò¢']

 I am an advocate for NOT working in teams.  My approach to the creative process (and problem-solving) is very different than most people.

It is a shame that the work world is now enamored with teams.  Project leaders should recognize that the high-functioning creative individual (left alone to do their work) can be a much better asset than a team of mid-witts with a &quot;systematic approach&quot;.  That is the reason I have stopped working for others and will not do so again.  A tendancy toward team-work in companies will lead to a dirth of innovation over time.

 The biggest trouble is that there is no longer collective intelligence, because an enormous amount of money is being spent to ‚Äúguide‚Äù what is perceived as the truth, but it‚Äôs not truth, it‚Äôs self serving.  When the manipulation becomes clear there is chaos, which is then guided to avoid any restrictions on the gains from the original manipulation.  As a physicist and systems analyst I have become convinced there are very few non-scientific articles in the main stream press that are not 80% spin.  Finding the spin is hard work requiring analysis of information from all interested parties to find where opposing sides agree, then build out truth from there.  Since most readers are driven by emotion rather than analysis, the calm reasoned voices rarely get traction.  For instance it is clear nothing much will be done about the climate until it really is a crisis, and then some very large companies have positioned themselves to make a very large profit off of questionable approaches.  This is very clear now from the behavior of politicians and these companies, but those calling them out are drowned out by the huge sums flooding talking points that destroy any current consensus to move forward.  In the end it looks to supercharge inequity and suffering, but it appears unavoidable due to the way power structures are hardened.  Eh, what will be will be.

 Investors don&#39;t have the best interest of society for resource allocations since as their focus is on  short termed gains and because there is an opportunity bias in investments due to probability theory (its effectively the same mathematics which leads to the house generally always winning at a casino) a free for all system of short term gains mathematically optimizes only the ability to funnel resources into the hands of a few based on initial advantages and or pure chance. (Models show that free market systems even if the initial distribution of resources is perfectly equal always mathematically lead to wealth concentration as a consequence of numerous events cascading.  This leads to power in the hands of a few which is generally bad for everyone else and the system as a whole without some regulatory feedbacks to curtail this behavior. <br><br>Sure in principal it could work but that means a dynamic multivariate system able to rapidly identify correct of errors and changes in the system as the develop which the system as it is now is broken as hell in large part causing climate change widespread waste of resources and yes pollution. In this context you can even consider the increasingly dire state of global warming  and climate change as in part a maladaptive  information cascade.<br><br> The chaos of markets which can often be self destructive is why successful large companies plan their supply chains rather than relying on markets and why neoliberalism almost always leads to worse outcomes when privatization is extended into places like healthcare or logistics.

 In YT many of us really don&#39;t notice the &quot;views&quot; number.  Instead, the YT algorithm sorts &quot;preferred&quot; topics on a user list, and intersects with high view channels that more or less might match the list of topics you watch.  The result is millions of individualized echo chambers.  The emphasis on the phenomena of misplaced confidence, and of egocentric bias is really well taken.  I do wonder whether we understand what we talk about when we use the word &quot;intelligence.&quot;  You might suspect that the idea has an implicit assumption that more &quot;neurons&quot; is equivalent to &quot;smarter.&quot;  When you consider that ant death spiral, misplaced confidence, and egocentric bias, I think that what we really see in mass behavior is the occasional &quot;equivalent&quot; of rogue waves.  The normal waves are always there, but sometimes they amplify each other.  So crowds may not only display unexpected &quot;wisdom,&quot; but extreme mass stupidity.

 Condorcet&#39;s Jury Theorem (1785) deserves a mention somewhere in this discussion in &quot;Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions.&quot;  Roughly, if the prior probability of an individual opinion being correct is greater than chance, then the more people included in the decision, the greater is the probability of it being correct.  <br>Referring to the video, the guess the weight of the bull gets more accurate as the number of guesses goes up.

 Sorry Sabine, but both stock markets and wikepedia are both &#39;rigged&#39; games in their own ways. So called &#39;stock-markets&#39;, are the worse., but ymmv. The &#39;market&#39; is ruled by a combination of outside manipulation, and sentiment, ie emotion. Imo, stock markets are fundamentally flawed, and useless, even harmful institutions. Anything requiring so much regulatory overhead to ensure its &#39;optimal operation&#39;, is likely not a good idea to begin with.  Many would say the same about the extremely biased and manipulative &#39;wikipedia&#39;. The notion it is ruled by a vast egalitarian collective is fundamentally WRONG. It is in fact, run a relatively small, tight nit group that has very specific agendas. The only thing that &#39;emerges&#39; from such a system, is top down narrative management. The only reason some might believe WP is broadly speaking &#39;democratic&#39; in some way, is marketing, ie belief. Not based on fact or evidence. Suggesting WP main problem is the sin of omission, which its (rather) small group of editors ruthlessly enforce, is actually accurate, but not for the reasons implied here.

 One way to avoid participating in collective stupidity is to stop watching TV and believing the mainstream news media.  So long as you are plugged into the mainstream media matrix you will be participating in collective stupidity without even knowing it.  You will take it to be normal reality.  Like for instance ... believing that a man (male) can be a woman just by deciding he wants to be (Self ID Gender Laws).  That&#39;s actually the law today in most Western countries.

 This kind of thing is worth exploring more of.  I see emergent behavior in various things, like markets in general. Frederich Hayek called this &quot;spontaneous order&quot;. But I would be careful about venturing into economics and politics.  I would argue that we can find better ways of managing and regulating markets, including stock markets,  than coercive government laws and regulations.  As a political entity, governments have different, non-economic incentives than investors and business people and consumers.  Some people think this makes government a good third party mediator and arbitrator in economic activities, but I think you&#39;ll find that in most cases, political incentives aren&#39;t very good at ensuring good laws and regulations for the market.  The 2008 economic crisis is a perfect example of that, if you look closely.  Government interference in the housing market helped create the crisis in the first place, and prevented actions that would have minimized the economic harm.

 I wish collective stupidity could be resolved, but its based on basic human attributes so this may not be possible. A human is not able to know everything, so we have to be selective about what we learn and often use pattern matching to make conclusions, without any deterministic understanding.<br><br>The solution would be to train all children to question everything they hear and only to believe what they can individually confirm. As we know from the 80/20 rule, only a small amount of people do the research bit of this. What makes it worst some people take advantage of this human attribute and push false information. As Lenin said in 1919, accuse others of what you are doing to them to justify your actions, is an effective method of taking advantage collective stupidity.<br><br>Personally I feel there is no simple solution to this issue, apart from effective education of children. Listen to everyone&#39;s point of view, even if you do not agree with it, but even if you do agree believe nothing until you can confirm it yourself. You may get the wrong answer in some cases, even when you do the research, but you will be right more often than not.

 Dr., have you noticed some contradictory math under this? Wisdom of crowds, but center of bell curve is the most &#39;popular&#39; not most intelligent. Intelligence is over on side of bell curve in &quot;quality&quot; position. Quality is always less popular, less numbers. The middle &quot;pop&quot; popular is mediocre. The crowd is .... always wrong. And in stocks, people always choose wrongly. (ChatGPT picks stocks based on 1 year old information and at the 80% value from then, still does well). The popular. It is simply correct on average. I believe this &quot;group think&quot; or herd behavior is a variant on game theory&#39;s use of &quot;modified tit for tat.&quot; From paramecium to super computer AI, tit for tat is a successful strategy over highly complex ones. Modified (with some forgiveness) even better. No mind, just tit for tat works! Similarly, the most beautiful by definition is a combination of many images, so the total more popular with more numbers. (You&#39;re aware of this?) Science more beautiful or popular should be predicted, similarly to be less quality or less correct.

 I think that the the absolute number one for collective cascade is that people simply don&#39;t want to be an outcast of a group. A close second is a lax attitude towards the concept of truth; some people simply don&#39;t care if the ideas they hold are true or not for egocentric or social reasons. <a href="about:invalid#zCSafez"></a>üíü

 I feel like a great example of collective stupidity are Reddit echo chambers. Anymore when you find a subreddit that is in any way related to a product it&#39;s going to be crawling with people who downvote criticism like it&#39;s their job, maybe it is idk. Absolutely kills discussion too because Reddit automatically pushes down downvoted comments. Which is a shame because after FB was infected by collective stupidity Reddit was a great place to go if you wanted to discuss a show or book or your hobbies etc. Oddly I&#39;ve been coming back to YT comments in recent months, you can find some surprisingly decent discussions nowadays, which considering YT&#39;s reputation for awful comments is a bit surprising lol.

 Leading up to the Internet bubble I was working for IBM in Europe. At a management meeting at the lab I was working at, we had some outside speakers. One was with an investment firm. They had developed a measure of Internet companies. This was meant to measure their investment potential. One of the companies, which had no income, had a measure in the tens of thousands. IBM&#39;s measure was about four. Of course, IBM was making lots of money on the Internet. I remember that when I heard this, I knew there would be a crash. It was just a feeling. Of course, it was correct. The investment community was making stuff up to drive money into the market. A typical case.

 Thank you for a really interesting video! Collective stupidity, or the madness of crowds, is a huge topic with many fascinating facets to think about. You talked about how confident people can influence others to go with their ideas, even though being confident doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re more likely to be right - but there&#39;s lots of other reasons people let others make decisions for them. We all do it every day. The world is just too complicated for any individual to fully comprehend, so we use heuristics to decide when to trust others.<br><br>In addition to confidence we often trust other people when they appear to be on &quot;our side,&quot; or when we perceive that they self-identify with the same traits that we do. This is how con men and grifters get past our defenses. They pretend to be members of the same group who want to share their knowledge with us because it benefits the group, but really they&#39;re using deception to benefit themselves. Grifters can start information cascades that last long after their individual grifts are done, with victims refusing to admit they were wrong. This is the source of a lot of misinformation we encounter today.<br><br>I think crowds are most wise when the individuals within them have no particular incentive to pick one option over another. In addition to confidence we have to wary of those who have a self interest in the topic that&#39;s being debated.

 It&#39;s been really nice to hear you talk more about emergence, chaos, &amp; complex systems more in the past few months. There seems to be so much potential in connecting bordering realms of science and maybe even shedding light in the emergence of seemingly entirely different universal mechanics at varying degrees of scale. The sciences all share in an intermeshed dialectical relationship - I remember distinctly a professor or an advisor sharing the &quot;collective knowledge wheel&quot; diagram of all the sciences where the outer boundaries represented the modern fields of study and the spokes of the wheel represent the boundary between sciences - it was emphasized that graduate studies and the modern sciences were about pushing the outer boundaries of that wheel, but is that not telling of our perspective on where we expect to find answers to phenomenon that appear emergent? Do we place enough focus on expanding in on the &quot;spoke&quot; boundaries within the wheel that separate the sciences (and scales)? It seems that things have been moving towards the latter in the past decade or two at least that I&#39;ve seen, and I&#39;m glad to see it finally getting more of a public platform.

 The question posited is &quot;How Can We Avoid It?&quot; and you only obliquely and briefly refer to the most relevant answer: have a reliable source to check for the objective facts. Our most pressing problems are made more harmful by the fact that a large percentage of us trust sources that make us feel good rather than sources that reliably present verifiable objective reality. By &quot;good&quot; I mean an appealing emotional reaction, which for too many people means the entertainment they get from hate and fear lying propaganda. But the appeal of lying propaganda is seemingly hard wired into us, and for-profit businesses have become very good at it. If you want to put a dent in collective stupidity through mass communication you have to emphasize the danger of unreliable sources. You&#39;re not doing that. There are many reasons not to of course, but then why bring up the question in the first place?

 I was surprised by your example of water‚Äôs waves being an emergent property because there were versions of double slit experiments done where particles were shot one at a time and there emerged a wave pattern (when there were no detectors at the 2 slits). This means that a single particle acts as if it‚Äôs among many, thus showing wave property, and so it‚Äôs not an emergent property at all which is what makes quantum mechanics so puzzling.<br><br>Also it seems dubious calling ant behavior as emergent behavior. It would seem that if you knew everything about an ant, you could predict how it would behave in a group, so the ‚Äòemergent behavior‚Äô isn‚Äôt emergent at all, just patterns you didn‚Äôt see before because you only looked at an ant and not the group.<br><br>Only if the change was truly transformational would it qualify as ‚Äòemergent property‚Äô and I wonder if the complex organization of molecules would count as such change from just a collection of quarks and other subatomic particles.

 I learned this one absolutely years ago in my youth. I knew (I didn&#39;t grow up in Europe) that Poland had a coastline. Obviously. I was decently educated enough to know this simple fact. I met a friend who came from the UK, and swore up and down that it did not! He was emphatic! He was so certain of himself. I am the 8th child of 9. I was NEVER the best in my family in any subject or sport and had been badly bullied at school. I doubted myself despite the certain knowledge Poland had a coast, after hearing him be so certain I was wrong and he was right. After years of always being told I was wrong in everything, I shrugged and said &quot;you must be right&quot;. Later, I checked because of a nagging feeling. Nope, I have been right all along.<br><br>Later as I lived longer and got older and just a little bit wiser, I discovered that I had been put down unfairly by others. I was right far more often than wrong and that others had caused me to have an unjustly negative self image. I had been trained to consider myself automatically as of less value and wrong compared to others.<br><br>Now I question even those who seem convinced of themselves. I am still not always right. I am not as intelligent as I would like to be and I know that I am only a short distance above the average, aka, enough to obtain a bachelors degree. This doesn&#39;t mean I allow myself to be swept aside any more and I am no longer as easy to fool.<br><br>Confidence or lack thereof is a HUGE factor in this. People put their faith too easily in those who speak with emphatic confidence rather than real experts because we naively assume no one would be so certain unless they had facts. But there is a large group of the population who fall in the dunning kruger way, to the false self belief in themselves that is the polar opposite of the condition I once had having no faith in myself whatsoever. These people believe they are always right despite having very little knowledge or facts on their side, and speak with conviction, misleading the crowds.<br><br>Just trust NONE of it. Neither yourself nor others without checking into all of whatever it is yourself carefully. And then check again doubted your first conclusion.<br><br>I never followed the crowd. That was part of my school yard downfall. I refused to follow, and became a loner. This no longer leaves me feeling the least bit sad. When I got to uni, I discovered veritable communities of loners! And we are better off than the followers. They are walking about with blindfolds on being led by the untrustworthy.

 2 biggest factors for collective stupidity are 1. Money in science, truth is the first casualty of economic interest,<br>2.  ignoring scientific evidence in favour of science fiction and clever mathematics which ignores the laws of physics.<br>As a result we have a whole model of physics built on a model which Bells Inequality and the double slit experiment both show is impossible, it cannot be particles it must be waves. Thereseven a simple experiment to prove it run the photo electric effect for longer, if Einstein were correct all free electrons would get used up,  this is not the case because they are vortices being created not electrons ejected. No particle physicist will admit it though, stupidity is being afraid of being shown wrong.<br>We know that any physics beyond the Planck scale are meaningless and singularities do not exist in real world physics. Yet the big bang and black holes (in reality dark stars) both violate the Planck scale and both have singularities, ie meaningless theories are promoted as fact. The big bang violates every known law of physics including QM, GR and Maxwells equations. They are models built on scifi added to make the evidence fit the belief, absolutely stupid.<br>Showing that the idea of average levels out is ridiculous if an idea is not scientific. Money and science tend not to mix, but the massive funsing behind pop physics means The big bang, Black holes and stars from gas clouds which cannot form gravity (its geometry not a force) are all collective stupidity kept promoted as fact by dosh while eliminating and censoring good science which threatens the egos, popularity, paypackets of those promoting such pseudoscience. <br>The Theory of Everything has been solved by a penniless, homeless interpreter who looked at the data of physics and said no you guys are interpreting this the wrong way. Turns out everything is easy to explain and the correct model of physics vortex and wave physics (alpha 137 are vortex equations) is here but the collective arrogant, stupidity and stubborness of particle physicists is so huge they cannot even see that the scifi and crazy meaningless math threatens to kill tgeir own children. The correct model of physics for anyone clever enough to think for themselves and look at what has zero money at stake look at my channel and ToE. No dazzling over complcated meaningless math and quabtum bizarre, crazy mysticism, just plain commin sense based in EVIDENCE and simple classical wav mechanics. We may no have much time left.

I was on a jury in which 10 found the person guilty and the other 2 eventually just gave up and caved in. They still did not believe the person guilty, but they weren&#39;t sure and ultimately just wanted to go home and weren&#39;t confident enough in their own beliefs to keep going.

There shouldn&#39;t be such a divide in our country. We should all unite towards improving our quality of life&#39;s, advancing science &amp; improving the struggles we all share in this unbalanced unforgiving modern day Capitalistic society. (We shouldn&#39;t let politics ever get in the way of that. We shouldn&#39;t let other people influence our minds to create such a divide &amp; sometimes we gotta realize that sometimes foreign nations support systems that try to stur up internal division in our country. So we should try our best to work together as a team. Even if we share different opinions. We don&#39;t need to agree on everything to get along or to get certain things done. So hopefully our society can evolve past the behavior we have seen these last handful of years. We can do much better than this. The universal thing I feel like we can all unite towards is that we all want better Life&#39;s. So let&#39;s set our minds on that.)

 Collective Stupidity starts with suspending first the fundaments and basic DNA-level senses in humans - such as the sense of scarcity:<br>Thermodynamically, there is no such thing called Capitalism, for example...<br>This is owing to the fact that fossil fuels have been traded under the doctrine of what&#39;s called &#39;supply and demand&#39;, not on the basis the stuff is finite.<br>What humans have lived, under our outgoing Western Civilisation and its &#39;Science&#39;, is actually the best of a Communism-disguised-Capitalism system.<br>What remains in the system, now fossil fuels are mostly gone to the ground - is more deception (in Science and Physics, too), gulags and wars.<br>Huxley and Orwell should be forgiven for thinking their systems can last forever - finite fossil fuels are dangerously hypnotic to humans and their mental capacity.<br>Humans were not ready morally, ethically and intellectually to start the mass extraction of fossil fuels with the advent of the steam engine 300 years ago.<br>20th Century Science will be revisited by humans post the fossil fuels age, to workout wheat from chaff - Science from Social Engineering...<br>The Magna Carta requires now overhauling - adding to it the right for humans to understand what Energy really is;<br>&quot;In any system of energy, Control is what consumes energy the most.<br>No energy store holds enough energy to extract an amount of energy equal to the total energy it stores. <br>No system of energy can deliver sum useful energy in excess of the total energy put into constructing it.<br>This universal truth applies to all systems.<br>Energy, like time, flows from past to future&quot;.

 Yup, anything we do together also feeds back into the way we regulate ourselves as we continue the activity with the same ppl, even affecting small shifts in attention, motivation from moment to moment.<br><br>I personally refer to this interrelational feedback as &quot;prehension&quot;, but in the human emotional context it&#39;s also &quot;alterity&quot;, which affects each person&#39;s autonomous (technically pseudo‚Äêautonomous) behavior. Prehension is also shifted by changes in the collective situation, which is influenced by how reach person behave.<br><br>So this emergence structure is kind of convoluted (in the literal sense) feedback amongst pseudo‚Äêautonomy (person), interrelational social effects (person to person), and the situation all the people are experiencing commonly (collective). And what emerges also feeds back into the situation.<br><br>Asch&#39;s findings are taught in social psychology, so social psychology, individual psychology, sociologists &amp; information theorists would need to figure out ethical ways to do interdisciplinary experiments to see what small initial and situational changes can be made to try and avoid the worst effects without kneecapping the beneficial prosocial or time‚Äê/resource‚Äêsensitive possibilities of collective activities<br><br>The harder part will be getting social media company owners to care about this more than operant conditioning through data mining.

A list noone likes (to keep actualized). Which problem would be the first to solve or re-arrange (in the USA, for certain) if the smart phone people mass jumps from a &quot;behaviour&quot; to &quot;another&quot;? Can we or any occurance change the ignorant people? who can want to learn to see or spot more faults that seem to get more demanding to correct or keep corrected? does the snake or serpent bites in its tail here? <br>Remember &quot;rick-rolling&quot; (Rick Ashley) almost twenty years ago? As if most people had turnt into &quot;gangsters&quot; or cukoos. Boys hardly have an awareness of benefiting when having mastered a complex problem, they dislike working for society (of they dont get a big reward) if it is &quot;not them&quot;. &quot;We&quot; even mostly forgot the speed of assembly in the environment how molecules gather often within laws of physics.

 Stupidity is at least as enigmatic a notion as intelligence. Or, probably, these two express some sort of symmetry wrt a more basic notion not mentioned here. One might assert dead matter is stupid in the sense that it is not intelligent, but confusingly also notice that expressed intelligence in living individuals and their constituent parts, and among them in, eg,  species, seem to only very unreliably solve optimizations that lagrangian-style optimized outcomes express effortlessly in dead matter. Or the dead matter stuff at least gets to a solution/ outcome state with minimal effort possible. So, what is stupid in the first place? Humans‚Äô various failed enterprises,  or other evolutionary-wise failed-but-once-living species that we can see historical evidence for, collectively do things that look pretty off the optimal solution track for sure, but the overall result may well be on a lagrangian sort of path of something to somewhere, and also with thermodynamics of irreversible processes intact. Would that be stupid or intelligent?

 There is no better example of collective stupidity than the voters who support the Democratic and Republican parties in the US.  Just like the ants running around in a circle in this video, these fools take the US in a circular political path (like being caught in a revolving door) where they alternate back and forth between 2 incompetent and corrupt parties.  They do this with the mindset of voting for the &quot;lesser of the 2 evils&quot;; while also choosing a party that won&#39;t create too much of a disturbance to the status quo.  Plus, they are so afraid of &quot;not fitting in&quot; with their peers.  And that usually entails supporting the status quo at all costs. But this creates a situation where many large problems never even get addressed, let alone get fixed.  But that fact doesn&#39;t appear to be an issue for them, as long as their preferred brand of evil gets put in charge.  Nor are they willing to accept any responsibility for any of the stupid or self serving decisions made by the politicians they voted in.  You would think that humans should be able to display more intelligence than this.  But merely looking at all of the wars that have raged across the globe throughout history (along with public support for them), it&#39;s easy to see just how entrenched collective stupidity actually is.

 The stock market has very little to do with investment. If you buy $1000 worth of Apple stock and then sell it for $2000, Apple gets $0. If you sell for $500, Apple gets $0. After the IPO the stock market has little direct influence on the corporation itself beyond buybacks and further issuances. The stock market just selects who gets the profits. People are gambling on the future value of a corporation. Just like horse racing, except for the dividends, which are usually not a stock market gambler&#39;s primary focus.<br><br>The magic of the Market is that it is all about perception. Double your money in two years. Are you going to be bullish or bearish? Well, if you went up 10x the first year and went down to double your money your perceptions might be different than if the stock price had just gone steadily upwards, eh? The secret of the Market is that it is a horrendously inefficient system. It gets people focused on metrics instead of reality.

 I was thinking of what you said about monopolies Sabine, and it reminded me of something I read in an essay that my favorite rocket scientist wrote around 75 years ago. It&#39;s quite long, but I&#39;ll take the time to type it all out because I think you could appreciate it, and, because I appreciate the time you take to make these videos l get to watch for free:<br><br>     &#39;&#39;When man&#39;s activities include a control over the prices of rent, food, light, power and other necessities, over laws, over expression in print or in public or any other form of individual life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, then his business most certainly becomes the business of the state.<br>     The trend towards monopoly is one of the greatest dangers inherent in private enterprise. This trend must be circumvented by public controls.<br>     When the press, the radio, the motion pictures are controlled by a small group, freedom of speech is inevitably curtailed and imperiled, as it is today.<br>     The accumulation of undue power, whether by government, labor, religion or capital or by any other group, must be prevented at all costs. Freedom cannot survive the alternative.<br>     Liberty will be always insecure until we realize this one fact. It simply does not matter who has the power, or in what name it is exercised.<br>     The possession or exercise of undue power, whether it be the power to ostracize, to starve, to threaten and terrorize, to restrict and inhibit, to censor and deny, by any group and for any purpose, is always wrong.<br>     The adequate restriction of power is the bulwark of civilization. It is no part of the function of the state to enter competitively or solely into any business. A state monopoly is as undesirable and reprehensible as any monopoly.<br>     But it is the function of the state to rigorously supervise and regulate all such activities, in order that those powers are not abused.<br>     It is certain that graft and stupidity will enter into this supervision, at least until the public demands officials of a much higher caliber than the present.<br>     It is certain that men will err. But it is better that some men have a limited power in order that other men do not have an unlimited power.<br>     The rights and responsibilities of labor and capital are no more and no less than those of any other individual or group. Neither of these groups, or any other group, has any right whatsoever to use economic, political or social pressure, or violence, or intimidation against any other group or individual.<br>     Those who do so must be held strictly accountable by law and by the rights of man. This, and not counter-violence and intimidation, is the proper recourse of opposing groups.<br>     When this law breaks down, the citizens committee is still bound by it, as a temporary state. If they are not, they are no more than a criminal mob.<br>     This by no means denies the validity or the necessity of revolution in extreme cases. When the state decays or collapses, or when the state or groups within the state arbitrarily violate the rights of individuals or other groups, and when all other recourse fails, then revolution becomes a necessity and a duty. By revolution I mean an armed uprising designed to end tyranny, oppression and exploitation.<br>     But this revolution, to be significant, must be inspired and guided by the principles of liberalism {actual, true liberalism, not the bullshit democrats have been spewing for nearly a century now}. Such was the American revolution. But the terror in France was a criminal mob. And the terror in Germany was an organized criminal mob. There are vast differences.<br>     The persecuted -- the Negro, the Jew, the underprivileged are fair game for tyrants who would woo them to their cause by a sentimental exploitation of their ignominy. And such persons, understandably driven to fury or despair by their intolerable treatment, never stop to think that these tyrants itch to impose the same persecutions on other groups in other names.<br>     To avail, a revolution must be something more than an inversion. Such persons, beyond all others, should understand liberalism and tolerance.<br>     Persecutors and exploiters lurk behind names, institutions, and traditions, often ridiculous and out worn, that receive the lip service of the unthinking. The greatest of the race are betrayed, their finest principles are smirched, perverted into wretched booby traps.<br>     Liberalism cannot substitute for liberals, and unless its code is informed by their blood, it will decay, as it has, and become infested, as it is. <br>     The plutocrat, the demagogue, and the shyster thrive in the carcass of a system splendidly designed to make men free. And the positivist haunts the aromatic vicinity like a jackal, seeking the moment when he may take advantage of the decay to appropriate the corpse.<br>     Liberalism must be inspired with new life with each new generation. It must be reconstituted, restored and reaffirmed, lest, in a moment of quiescence, the carrion eaters close in.&#39;&#39;<br><br>BTW Doc, I&#39;m a loser, with no life, so I can always manage to find an extra 5‚Äì6 milliseconds to show my appreciation by hitting that like button. I just wish everybody who watches your videos had enough spare time in their lives to do the same.

 I&#39;m glad the phenomenon of confident people dragging down collective performance was mentioned. I feel there&#39;s a lot more to it, though. &#39;Group politics&#39; for example. A member of a group might say or do things they don&#39;t think are for the best, because they were influenced by others. There could be a any number of motivations for doing so. To my experience, there is almost always someone in a group who seek to control what others say or do. Usually they fall in the category of &#39;confident people&#39;. Sometimes that&#39;s a good thing (people confident in their ability happen to be right at times), but often it isn&#39;t.

Whether or not it is wise to administer booster shots every couple months for protection against covid can be assesed by evaluating the costs and the benefits of doing so and not doing so.

But if administering booster shots prevents the spread of covid and the number of deaths it causes to a degree that outweighs the negatives it causes, you could argue that doing so would be the right choice.<br><br>I found one such study which assesses the risks and benefits of administering 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, from Julia W. Gargano et al. 2021. According to the study&#39;s findings, for each million second dose covid vaccine admininistered to males 5,700 to 15,300 covid cases would be avoided (depending on age group) and 2 to 700 deaths would be avoided (depending on age group). Depending on age group, 3 to 69 myocarditis cases would occur. The numbers for females depending on age groups are 8,500 to 14,900 cases prevented, 1 to 347 deaths prevented, and 1 to 10 more myocarditis cases. Evaluating purely the risk-benefit scenario with respect to covid cases, deaths and myocarditis cases, the benefits of administering second covid vaccine doses outweigh the negatives. Covid vaccines can of course cause several other side-effects, and these should be taken into consideration when evaluating the risk-benefit scenario. They have been taken into consideration in other studies, and the benefits still appear to outweigh the harms.<br><br>Of course this is not an argument to support that it is the right choice for everybody to get booster shots every couple of months, since you might find it a hassle to do so, and I support your decision of exercising your freedom of choice in that way.

 There&#39;s more to the 2008 crisis than just handing out mortgages with anyone with a pulse i.e &quot;stated income loan&quot;. The idea was to create a Ponzi of endless house appreciation whereas anyone can get a mortgage =&gt; pent up housing demand =&gt; house appreciation =&gt; refinancing on house equity pays the mortgage. Thus disconnecting the need to pay a mortgage from any sort of personal salary or revenue, and leveraging what would increase inflation. It was a way to loophole the system for the personal gain of a few (realtors, loan originators, banks) at the expense of many (inflation for all and ever insane house prices). Anyone with 2 brain cells and an understanding of the exponential function saw that this could only go on for a few years at most and it did: As soon as house appreciation wasn&#39;t as FAST as was needed to sustain the Ponzi, it crumbled. Higher mortgage rates SLOWED down this needed and priced in house appreciation.<br>Today we face the same game again with another bubble 2.0 this time built on systemic inflation used to inflate house prices so the inflation is the catalyst not the side effect like in bubble 1.0.

 I agree with all of this. The science about thinking is an amazing topic. My example of group behavior being affected (and infected) by social media is how information used to flow when I was younger compared to now. Before the internet, our local news paper had an opinion section to communicate ideas, and if a person thought that the city moving the farmer&#39;s market further away from the 202 bypass was a terrible idea, they could share their opinion posted in the news paper and the next town hall meeting like minded individuals who agree with that sentiment could tell the mayor in person and possibly reverse this decision. Fast forward to now. Now an issue that is happening 2000 miles away in a different state is affecting our local town hall meetings and changing local laws when there wasn&#39;t even an issue locally. As always, thank you for posting these science updates!

 Great video as usual Sabine, One thing I would like to point out though is the comment on the remedy for egocentric bias is not forming an opinion. In truth, the remedy for egocentric bias is critical thinking combined with self-reflection on one‚Äôs own bias&#39;. One must always question their beliefs or information they think they know, on research into the topic and reviewing what they think is correct, against what they discover the facts present. At first glance this may seem like not being confident but if the decision you are proposing is based on the information you now know is correct (given the information available) that can make you more confident and accurately so. So ensuring the confident individuals in the group have accurate information in which they based their opinion on, by asking what information or facts are included in the opinion before follwing them, we couls all make netter, more informed decisions.

 A factor that you don&#39;t directly discuss is the effects of regulations on the market stupidity.  Regulations are very much a double-edged sword.  They theoretically keep markeks &quot;fair&quot;, but often (usually?)  result in the regulators putting their thumbs on the scales of individual and group decisions -- which inevitably leads to sub-optimal outcomes.   Why?  Because no set of regulators have access to the combined knowledge of the larger markets -- so regulated outcomes inevitably lead to worse outcomes.  The tighter and more restrictive the regulations, the worse the outcomes.<br>Some recent examples?  The boom and bust in diesel cars, entirely caused by regulations.  The real estate bubble (and bust) was entirely the result of lending and interest regulations by central banks and government officials.   In fact you&#39;d be hard pressed to point to a stock market crash that wasn&#39;t caused by regulators or government officials mucking around with interest rates or the money supply.<br>This is why open market economies always outperform centrally planned economies.

 Herd behavior isn&#39;t just people doing the same thing.  It also involves the desire for status, which is gained by doing what everyone else does but doing it first.  It isn&#39;t only competent people who make quick decisions.  There&#39;s a sense that jumping to a quick decision can make you look confident and decisive regardless of your knowledge and experience, and this gives you status.  Conversely, spending time to contemplate evidence before making a decision can make you look weak and indecisive, and likely to attract ridicule due to the related bullying instinct.  Worse than any of this is changing one&#39;s mind after a decision has been made.  This is why groups often make bad decisions, then stick to them regardless of evidence to the contrary.  Eventually, real and certified evidence becomes irrelevant, with almost any excuse becoming valid to ignore or contradict it.

 The government response to Covid was vastly inappropriate. It was so far out of proportion to the actual risk of harm. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola in Africa and one case landed in Texas. Authorities did a great job of stopping it there. Ebola has a 40% fatality rate. If Ebola got out we would have had much worse than the recent lockdowns and for good reason. By contrast Covid has a 0.1% fatality rate. Normal life would have a fatality rate of a full 1% in a hypothetical quasi-utopia where everyone lives to age 100 and maintains a stable population. Yet our response to Covid was proportional to a disease with around 1% or higher fatality. Through various forms of economic damage, even in the healthcare sector and logistical disruptuons in medicines and life essentials, we have probably knocked off a year or two from everyone‚Äôs life expectancy. So we traded something like 2% for 0.1% thanks to collective stupidity and hysteria in bioethics. My comment history proves I knew this almost from the very start.

 There is a moral element to intelligence --particularly in evaluating group think - -that we use our critical faculties to question and standup to the group. This was perhaps best expressed in word and example by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.  There is a tendency for those who know better in their individual thoughts to give in to groups out of cowardice and exhaustion knowing that - - as Galileo might say but the world really does orbit the sun.THe Trump phenomena in the US very much demonstrated how important this critical faculty is - -he and his inner circle would say the most idiotic things and his supporters would ignore it or say they believe out of convenience - - disinfectant to kill Covid in the lungs - - marking up hurricane maps, claiming Putin is a genius - -  claiming the Christian right while paying off porn stars - - it is a willing suspension of intellectual honesty just to feel that you too can have the thrill of the crowd.

 Collective stupidity has commercial value.  An early example was cigarette companies actively suppressing or attacking evidence that smoking could  be harmful and lead to numerous diseases.  These efforts have produced some pretty sublime efforts to promote stupidity.  In numerous recently, produced &quot;historical&quot; movies and series, vivid portrayal of excess drinking and smoking by the hero or by the royal family have been produced.  These often do include some homage to the dangers by an occasional hero or royal dying of a substance related disease (appearance of fair and balanced).  Yet quantitatively, many more example of use, than consequence.  Repetition is a fundamental aspect of memory.  So it&#39;s subtle, but possibly effective for the tobacco and adult beverage industries.  Next came the fossil fuel industry, who knew about the possibility to global warming 70 years ago, but since it might cut into their bottom line, eventually came to deny it and lobbied against it.  So personal wealth vs global climate.  More recently Fox news has been involved in promoting stupidity to enhance their bottom line, to the point that telling the truth would lead to viewer unhappiness and financial loss, and so they went back to stupidity.  More recently the Republican party has chosen to abandon democratic principles (a collective decision process).  In a democratic system each citizen is given one vote   Corporations and billionaires(bullies) have sought to bias this in their favor by interfering with the process at all levels possible.  In a recent interview a Republican statesman noted that being Republican was very lucrative (carrot) but straying from the party line, a candidate would be primaried (stick) or directly threatened (big stick). to stay in line.  It is known that Russia had money to influence the 2016 election.   The point of all this is: that stupidity can be purposely shaped by punishment or reward by corporations, foreign states or billionaires.

This is how atoms work within our atmosphere, for the same reasons when  we compress gases until we don‚Äôt cool down enough below freezing to absolute zero, you can‚Äôt force more atoms into to the same place.

 There&#39;s also something else here that&#39;s very important, and you touched upon it when you mentioned confident people, and that is, there&#39;s a certain amount of founders bias, i&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an actual term, but the idea is that if someone comes along and asserts something that sounds reasonable, then the next person who asserts the opposite then has to overcome egocentric bias, of all the people who have formed conclusions in the initial assertion. <br><br>Essentially the first person has to do less work in proving their assertion, and the subsequent people have to do more work in it. This is why in propaganda people are eager to assert that say, Russia shot down MH17, before even the black box was analysed or even recovered...

 The 2008 financial collapse of the housing market and derivatives was identified as specifically caused by &quot;flippers&quot;   who owned 3 to 4 houses and expected the market to continue to rise.  When the market began to slow, these investors began walking away from the loans that were not providing sufficient ROI. It was financially better to simply default.  Contrary to some belief, single family home owners did not initiate the collapse but continued to try and pay their mortgages as they have a greater incentive to do so.  It was, after all, their home and lifetime hope and dream.  Single family home owners were the ones that most suffered, after the market  collapsed, lost their job, and budgeting out food and heating was insufficient.

 It&#39;s not just an &quot;information&quot; cascade. There are also incentives invloved. Like, you don&#39;t just stockpile toilet paper because the fact that others stockpile it makes you think they have a good reason to do it, but also because the fact that others stockpile it makes it harder to acquire, so you better have a stockpile. And if a speculation bubble bursts, it is partly because people wanted to profit from rising stocks even though they knew that they were overvalued, and then if the stocks stop rising, they know the bubble has burst and should sell quickly before they lose money, which of course gives the burst of the bubble a self-accelerating dynamic. The phenomenon that individually rational and well-informed decisions lead to a bad outcome for the collective can also be seen in the Braess paradox.

 in my own little statisical analysises over time. i started thinking that evolution, religions and the feelings/reflexes are relative to this mechanism. i mean evolution is syncronous in genetic mechanisms yet also has sync with human brain and animals minds and information on that. i mean we see some animals copied colirs from another animals brains memory ie the picture seen from another animals eye is etched on another animals pattern :P that indicates this information is transferred from one animals visual memory to another animals dna machinery :P which looks impossible from todays prespective but that seems like happened and thinking about this subsystem ...stiill its not perfect. like our memories isnt. which is probably some kind of error correction protocol too i guess.<br>also that feelings /sub intelelctual thinking/ligic subsystem redirects humans and thats why we feel like there should be god :P which i think its the feeling of god :P which actually is existing but not actually what we feell like it is or religion thinks it is atleast its not directly what controls that syncronisation. so people belive in god .. which is not completely belive to meaningless thing ... but still thats not actually what it is :P ...<br>also thats how dicdators controll mass population. by sensuring redirecting information.... and belive it or not... thats whay trump says (by knowing actually or not :P ) fake news :P i mean thats how liberals won elections by controlling collective intellectual flows :P ... and thats why twitter facebook and other followed that flow even fi they believed it or not :D ... thats long story anyway if we go deep down to details ...

 Collective Wisdom/Intelligence is the baseline or starting reference.  There are usually historical or psychological and survival reasons for the collective Wisdom, or the answer Collective intelligence comes up with, and you first need to understand why it is a held belief or how the answer was derived to then be able to compare it to whatever the new idea is.  Collective stupidity is just when this process goes wrong.<br><br>Collective Wisdom/intelligence is usually a safe choice when there is no time to properly asses a situation since it has so far seen to the survival of the group but there are many historical cases where it has lead to catastrophe, or where the overthrow of the collective  Wisdom/intelligence has greatly benefited the group.

 Oh, you&#39;re so close, now. lol. None of us are running this thing, Sabine. The persona that is Sabine, just like the persona that is Richard, is a wonder of nature, but it is an emissary for a wordless intelligence that is distributed among us. Personas, emerging as they do from ape brains, converge on conflict on purpose. We are the only creature that kills and dies over abstractions, and we need motivation to act out this drama-that-is- computation (competition=computation), so we imagine ourselves to exist as independent agents. But this persona is limited by human cognitive scope and by the I-Thou construct in a way the master of the body is not. The narrative, speaking self or persona is not really driving this animal. It&#39;s the emissary for a master that remains backgrounded. It&#39;s a biological behavioral scheme. Anyhoo, it&#39;s driving the bus and all we can do is piece together soothing narrative fragments in its wake.

In particular, also the fact that many people in groups agree with the judgement of others and especially of the majority, even though in their opinion it is wrong.

 One of the best information cascades before the Internet was from advice columns in newspapers. It was one of the very best forums. Dear Abby and Ann Landers were two of the most famous, and many people swore by their pronouncements. (They were cousins, IIRC.)<br><br>I used to read them myself, and I agreed with a lot of their advice. And one thing that impressed me was that they admitted their mistakes and gave follow-up corrections. Often in the form of letters from respondents. Unlike many posting in social media, Ann Landers and Dear Abby would cite their research including consulting expert authorities. She would have contacted the Attorney General, or the Sheriff of the town being referenced, a knowledgeable lawyer, the Surgeon General, regulatory advisors, or other authorities and sources.<br><br>Their columns were actually good ways to learn critical thinking and evaluation. Two of their common aphorisms include: &quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&quot; (Tho &quot;broke&quot; depends on the use, results, and scope, much like science.)<br><br>The other one, perhaps more apropos of this video, was:<br><br>&quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&quot;

Galilei assumed, like all other people at this time, that clocks can measure something like time, but today we know, that they only compare two movements with each other. So movements may be relative to each other (in fact they are), but speeds never can. Measuring the speed of a movement depends on the clock it&#39;s measured with and doesn&#39;t change the state of the movements physicallity. But an movement of a clock itself, changes the speed, with which it counts seconds.

Work ahead - 1 lane only. Currently : 20 km jam, 4 hours delay!<br>Alternative: take next exit and follow signs. 15 min delay&quot;. So I left the overcrowded highway and followed the signs. To my utter amazement,I was totally alone. I saw no car in front of me or in my mirror for about 15 minutes. Talk about ignoring your personal information to follow the herd üòÆ<br>Herd behaviour is exacerbated in stress and disaster situations. I had emergency training with firemen for my work and one of the first thing they taught was that, if you are ever caught in a disaster, ignore the crowd, stop 30 seconds to observe and think by yourself.

Photons gauge the E/M field virtually, though the force carrier is described by Lagrange and Hamilton through kinetic and potential energy...and by Feynman as taking all paths to get to its destination. I&#39;m perturbed by this theory, since its fractal. lol. The idea that particles merely revolve in line with Newton never occurs to them. Well, they never got to Proposition 44, our WhizzFlashBang kids.

 In 2007 I was doing appraisals for bank foreclosures. I consistently butted heads with banks because they wanted higher valuations than I was willing to give. Eventually they stopped using me. Well, within a few months the chickens came home to roost. Crash! Warning signs were there. Some of us spoke up. Most people didn&#39;t listen. I watched,  waited, bought low when everyone needed to sell. Thank you W for your crappy(lack of) economic policies. Thanks everyone (citizens and politicians at large)for the collective euphoria, panic, and overall ignorance of the operation of financial markets that allowed me to retire at 40.

 One needs only to understand holism, as defined by Jan Smuts in his 1926 book &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot;. Any whole is more than the sum of its parts because the interrelationships of these are functional, to effect the purpose of the whole, and thus require &quot;awareness&quot; of what their functions are. Consciousness is thus an emergent property of what makes a whole precisely more than a simple assemblage of parts, and it is present on every whole, from the atom to the galaxy. Only wholes may manifest in reality, i e., exist. And no, particles are not wholes, they are just excitations in a field, so they don&#39;t &quot;exist&quot; holistically speaking, just mathematically.<br><br>What we need is holistic physics, like in biology. Treat the atoms as wholes and chemistry will make more sense and close the gap with biology.

 The 2008 financial crash occurred because the making of loans was the be all and end all. Nobody cared whether the borrowers could repay their loan because the incentive structure for those approving loans on behalf of their employer was loaded on the front-end. In other words, loans were treated in the same way as sales, namely the amount of commission that you earned depended on the number and amount of the loans you approved. Nobody cared if the loans would ever be repaid because a) the people at the top were on exactly the same incentive structure, and b) the important thing was to get people into debt.

 There is also simple statistics to consider. If a decision is easy (an individual&#39;s probability of being correct is higher than 50%), a group decision is likely to be correct. If a decision is hard (an individual probability of correctness is less than 50%), a group decision is likely to be wrong. (This simplification assumes people are fungible.) (Well, almost fungible...

 Really good video for mental survival in the internet age. I do wonder whether what insects show is better described as creativity - solutions in an environment derived from evolved behaviour - as opposed to intelligence which we generally associate with cognition. Based on this video it seems to me that collective intelligence relates to having some cognitive intelligence in a group whereas collective stupidity is derived more from behavior such as confidence and cognitive bias. Interesting that the problem of bias is related less to small groups than mass communication such as we now have access to. If so we may have an evolutionary problem due to the scaling up of groups.

 I think most problems in human society boil down to issues of inequality. Could the best way to minimise collective stupidity be to do everything we can to ensure everyone is on a equal footing when it comes to information gathering and sharing? And make sure that people aren&#39;t afraid to question things or say if they disagree with the collective? It seemed like many of the examples given were issues of being in hierarchical groups, where some people are seen as being in control or privy to more information than others. <br><br>I suspect this may be an issue for psychological studies where they aren&#39;t taking account how most participants will see themselves in an inferior role to the people who are carrying out the research and they may unconsciously behave in the way they believe the researchers want or expect them to - and they could guess what this behaviour is simply by the way the experiment is set up.

The issue isnt they themselves but how fixed those hierachies are and by what merit they form. Sure we need to put bounds on hierachies too. All together rejecting hierachies is imo idealist stupidity. Breaking down complex systems down to one fundamental principle is predestined to fail.']

 I think the internet has been huge for stopping collective stupidity. Suddenly, anyone has access to any information. My mother was extremely hard working and went from being a poor farm girl to C-Suite level at a corporation. However, she lacks a ton of knowledge outside of her technical domain (she&#39;s exceptionally good in her domain). I hope to be as good in my career as her but with the internet I&#39;ve been able to learn so much more through audio books, documentaries, online courses, etc. An easy example are audio books - I run everyday for about an hour and listen to an audio book during it. I usually finish one to two books per month. If I do that for a decade, I will have read between 120 to 240 books just by having my phone/the internet. My mom also runs daily but could never do what I&#39;m doing simultaneously. Reading 240 books, if you are wise in your book selection, will absolutely transform your life and perspective in the world.

 Who defines &quot;Stupid&quot; and the misuse of the words &quot;Smart, Stupid and intelligent&quot; is amazing. I was always taught that &quot;smart&quot; just meant you know things, sort of the opposite of &quot;stupid&quot; (not exactly because it depends on WHAT also. BUT Not necessarily that the things you know are &quot;Correct&quot;! A term that can also be somewhat nebulous in meaning. Intelligent is also a somewhat nebulous term, I always thought it meant how quickly someone picks up an idea, NOT that the idea is necessarily correct. I have met some seemingly  slow thinking people that actually had a very good grasp on things. I know many &quot;intelligent&quot; people that see or make problems much harder than needed, over analyzing them if you will! I find that a lot of people that are told that they are highly intelligent think they are always correct which is definitely not true! As far as collective stupidity, don&#39;t forget there is a lot of collective &quot;correctness&quot; and thus though SMART  and TRUE out there also. When something gets repeated often enough the masses tend to agree without thinking, but should really be saying - what/where is the proof? Is the &quot;proof&quot; itself just a collective agreement? Often collective agreement is often used even as a scientific proof - even though the proof is wrong!       Just my slow mental wanderings!

 I&#39;ve found that the best way to know if someone (or yourself) is knowledgeable about a political subject is how strongly they believe their opinion. The more strong their belief, the more ignorant they are. Knowledgeable people are capable of arguing passionately for any side of a complex issue, even if they hold that a particular opinion is more correct than others. It&#39;s impossible to have a strong opinion about something when they completely understand all the sides --  because complex issues are complex, but people want simplistic beliefs so they can be more comfortable and confident.

 Sabine, your most valuable comment is garbage in and garbage out. Relatively rational elites, responsible journalists, and an emphasis on fairly uniform cultural expression was historically the norm. Today, stupid  collective elite ideology, irresponsible journalists, and an absence of cultural uniformity being taught in schools is creating a chaotic potpourri of a lot of misinformation or untruths which are polluting cultural norms to a great extent in the name of free speech on social media and biased bot censorship by big tech on the internet. The net result is more garbage information in and less reliable input out. Collective stupidity is increasing with an exploding abundance of biased collective groups that are quite dumb. Once stupid chaos begins it is almost impossible to stop and that is why I fear an eventual rule by a one party tyranny that tries to restore some semblance of order with tyrannical threats and actions but not a country ruled by a system of just laws and their enforcement. One note of optimism. There are still collective groups of science minded humans promoting responsible intelligent elites such as yourself so there is still hope that violent revolution won&#39;t be necessary in the foreseeable future. Best wishes. Uldis

 In the segment, &#39;What can we do?&#39;,  and in reference to what you have offered in advice; the pathway to that thought process requires cognitive deductive reasoning before sound conclusions can be ascertained by an individual.  In such situations, rationalised reasoning as a result of cognitive dissonance occurs, whereby instinctive or unconscious and subconscious tendencies kick in.  Whilst in a state of cognitive dissonance one experiences confusion and uncertainty in how they are experiencing reality, i.e. new data has invoked a reassessment of one&#39;s currently held beliefs and attitudes. <br><br>In a primal sense, having uncertainty in your reality puts you in danger, hence we seek immediate and efficient resolution to this experience.  The resolution is not one that requires logical truth.  In the moment of feeling danger, in the face of an uncertain reality, we are more open to being instructed and led by the herd because it&#39;s a more efficient way to align our reality. Likewise, the need to feel &#39;belonged&#39; is a fundamental psychological requirement too, as such it can be prioritised over the need for sound logical conclusions.  <br><br>So, when it comes to &#39;What can we do?&#39; all of the logical actions you have advised here feel right, however, I would supersede them with methods that invoke a more aware sense of self. A mind space that allows the required cognitive actions and behaviours to be invoked.  Most humans don&#39;t trust their own logical deductions, they don&#39;t believe they can comprehend reality on their own, they are already subject to any give scenario before they even know it&#39;s occurring. Even the most intellectual humans use intellectualisations as means of coping and projecting their own unconscious bias. Ego plays a massive role too, but that&#39;s another conversation. The key place to find is a place of awareness, a neutral observer position, a psychological mind space that has had the blackboard wiped clear. Such an approach needs cultivation of thought patterns and is the bedrock for any effective thought processes in the effort to address collective stupidity.

 Human language has a stupidity built into it.  We all use adjectives and adverbs, but they have no clear meaning.  For example, what is the dividing line between &quot;big&quot; and &quot;not big?&quot;  The dividing line is undefined, which implies the adjective is vague.  Such words are convenient or lazy abbreviations for an unstated relative comparison such as &quot;bigger than&quot; a breadbox.  They can be used to manipulate and deceive unwary listeners.  A wary listener should ask &quot;how big do you mean?&quot;<br>     Two of the most insidious &amp; destructive adjectives are &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;  They&#39;re misleading abbreviations for relative comparisons using the &quot;worse than&quot; relation (or the &quot;better than&quot; relation, which generates the equivalent reverse ordering).<br>     Adjectives and adverbs are one type of false dichotomy.  Another important false dichotomy is pairs such as &quot;approve or disapprove,&quot; &quot;support or oppose,&quot; and &quot;right track or wrong track.&quot;  These terms can misleadingly lump together people who actually have opposite preferences.  For example, someone who says he &quot;disapproves&quot; of Biden might mean he prefers Trump over Biden, but it could instead mean he prefers Bernie Sanders over Biden, or is disappointed that Trump hasn&#39;t yet been indicted, etc.  If pollsters truly wanted to report collective intelligence instead of wanting to manipulate us using collective stupidity, they would ask people to rank alternatives in order of preference and use that data to count all of the head-to-head majorities -- which is immune from spoiling -- instead of asking about false dichotomies.<br>     Careful readers will note that I wrote several adjectives in the paragraphs above.  I hope their meaning is clear enough to communicate my points.

 Pease explain how focusing on collective intelligence/stupidity as a topic while NEGLECTING  to include human mental maturity questions is useful. Lack of maturity contaminates things like bias, confidence, and information cascade.  It is reasonable to assume that the bees and ants group examples you chose are mainly comprised of developmentally mature individuals but human history is heavily populated with trends, events and sometimes explosive examples where functional mental maturity clearly plays a vital part.<br><br>For example, people who latch onto conspiracy theories which later are found to be both harmful and baseless are NOT exemplars of mature adults, but are only physically resembling mature ones.  Some even have the grey hair associated with wisdom and yet, they exhibit unusually high defensive, impulse behavior and do NOT consider future outcomes when reaching conclusions. Weighing future consequences while deciding is supposed to be one key differentiation between children and adults.<br><br>I would argue strongly that millions of Americans in particular exhibit a high degree of immaturity and harmful social group-think.<br><br>One unique example is disruptive behavior on domestic airline flights with respect to the required use of masks to counter Covid spread during the pandemic.  The FAA logged approximately 5700 disruptive events on airplanes in 2021, 73% of which centered on mask compliance.  Some incidents were violent.  No other country in the world came close to this harmful STUPIDITY.<br><br>It is time for us to begin a public discussion/debate on the quality of multi-generational family systems which undoubtedly constitute the origin of so many NEEDLESS harmful trends and behaviors due to stunted mental development.<br><br>Please reconsider your approach on this topic.

 I think part of the problem is that sometimes being stupid has its evolutionary advantages for survival. In our lineage, this goes all the way back to where we split from apes that didn&#39;t want to leave the trees and forests. Then it was exploring over the next ridge and leaving the safe valley, etc. These days it&#39;s the same thing but in ideas and knowledge itself, hell, some people might not even be capable of learning, especially if they&#39;ve been socially reinforced and learned how not to learn. Things like that. We will always have a lowest common denominator and the bulk of people that don&#39;t know any better and also never stand a chance - except for the occasions when staying behind in the proverbial trees turns out to be a good thing.

 Another great video from Sabine.  Thanks a lot for this.  <br>Something else comes to my mind on this subject.  When you talk to people about why they aren&#39;t doing anything about climate change - and I don&#39;t mean big things by that, just a lot of small bites every day - then the answer is always: And what&#39;s the point?  Who else will do anything?  I&#39;m trying a different approach here.  I&#39;m only one of 8 billion people and don&#39;t need to solve the problem alone.  If I save just one liter of petrol, that&#39;s 8 million tonnes of petrol in a global scale - quite a lot.  That&#39;s how ants do it too.  I don&#39;t think they constantly torment themselves with the thought that they are working all alone and the rest of the people are idle.<br>But it is so comfortable to say &quot;I cannot do anything&quot; because I assume others might not do enough. Ants are more clever.

 You are so intelligent, but we are hitting an insidious barrier. Until we first upgrade our psychology (specifically on narcissism), we will continue to face this barrier to intelligence. It is the fragile egos that are the number one barrier to intelligence. We will increasingly need to look at personality styles (and their interactions, just like how particles interact) before we can even attempt to look at solving any problems. If anyone would understand this, it would be you, SH!!! It is why you find some of your colleagues &quot;difficult.&quot; It is more that they are working to gain narcissistic supply than actually solve physics... Take a look at the narcissistic personality style and how it is insidious to all progress because it is a naturally destructive force... Check out, Dr. Ramani...

 Great video and very relevant for the times. It&#39;s precisely human decision making that is under attack by malicious actors these days and a challenge for all people is to ward themselves against it. Being aware of some of the pitfalls and mechanism is a great start. Of course, there is a lot more at play when it comes to human decision making but that lies more in the realm of psychology. Cognitive bias, heuristic reasoning, identity based thinking and susceptibility to authority are all mechanisms that can determine decision making.

 You&#39;re simplifying that 2008 Bank Fiasco. The government forced the banks to do it. I mean United States government. The idea was that poor people should have homes to not just people with good jobs who studied hard and had a great work ethic and therefore we&#39;re making actual real money. So under the Obama Administration banks with coerced into lending money and if they refused they were threatened with the Federal Trade Commission forbidding those Banks from being able to purchase certain Properties or merge. The banks knew full well they would lose their shirts on this and we&#39;re compelled to put what they knew were going to be bad loans into Securities to sell to others. This was entirely the fault of the United States government. This whole idea of equity is garbage. Equity requires taking from people who are earning something and giving it to people who didn&#39;t just so you can have an equal outcome. Our founding fathers did not actually believe in egalitarianism only that everyone should be treated equally under the law but not necessarily that everyone should have the same shit and that every outcome should be the same. Session ideas anti-capitalist and anti darwinian. I have no problem with the survival of the fittest concept. If you don&#39;t work you go hungry.

 The 2008 market crash had another element that is commonly left out.  Before mortgages are bundled into MBE&#39;s, they are graded on their quality based on risk.  Not all mortgages are AAA quality.  Yet, the public-private corporation formed by congress known as Fannie Mae was being used to back those riskier mortgages while certifying them as AAA.  This led to the creation of MBE&#39;s that were trading as AAA, but were heavily contaminated with lower quality mortgages.  When those bad mortgages started going delinquent it became clear the value of those MBE&#39;s were not as advertised.  Thus the 2008 event was the result of the information in the MBE market being corrupted.

 Good advice : 1. Avoid following Confident people (be especially critical of these people,  especially if they come or became quickly confident).  2. Never make up your mind and form an opinion,  hold competing theories in your mind,  never get married to an idea,  and be willing to have your working theories toppled by a better way of looking at things that not only can improve your theory,  but can reverse or topple your theory.<br><br>I would throw in : read more than 2 sentences or lines of other people&#39;s comments,  since 1 in 10 comments are usually life changing, mind changing,  more brilliant than original article or video,  or just hold important hints needed to crack a bigger problem.   The information needs to be logically irrefutable,  not cheerleading,  or hide erroneous information behind credentials.  The logic must be able to stand up on its own.   Everyone makes mistakes at least 20 to 8 percent of the time,  and it does not take credentials to point out errors,  bias,  logic errors,  blind spots,  myopia,  or missing information that should have been provided that otherwise is a stumbling block for newbies of the topic....  Finally,  no one has a Monopoly on the truth.   There is no infallible human Pope.  Even AI will always get things wrong. There are only logical arguments that have not yet been shot down.  It should help studying higher math,  since each step is proven before moving on to the next step.   If someone did poorly in Math,  then it is also likely that their opinions are more flawed.    Also,  not all Science fields equal,  and people trust scientists&#39; opinions who are out of their lane.  In fact,  scientists do not like challenging consensus opinion, but are prone to attack new ideas,  especially those that can overturn a life&#39;s research or interrupt current grant money.    Finally,  look at the profit motives,  but use this evidence with a grain of salt,  but it is a hint.  Money is nearly always the underlying driver of everything.  But not always.

 Collective stupidity is indoctrination and indoctrination is a function of agreeableness, because agreeableness is an off switch for critical thinking. Therefore the only protection from &quot;collective stupidity&quot; (that I&#39;m aware of)  is disagreeableness because disagreeableness protects the individual from systemic bias, as demonstrated by the Asch conformity experiment. When Nietzsche describes the ubermensch, all he&#39;s describing is someone with at least above average intelligence who is also extremely disagreeable.

 On a more serieus side: everytime Sabine comes up with sth for donations or so, the systems only accept credit cards or PayPal (which is also kind of a credit card system, it seems), but not debit cards, and most Europeans are fine with only having a debit card.

This reflects in the low heritability scores.<br>2) The study finds a huge gender difference in CONFP, but no such difference in CONFM. However, that gender difference is not explained / put into a hypothesis, or why it occurs in one experiment and not the other, nor do the authors test or control for it in their subsequent genetic testing.<br>3) Heritability consists of two factors: genetic heritability and environmental heritability. Just like a pair of identical twins inherits identical genes, they also &quot;inherit&quot; the same environment, if they are brought up by the same parents in the same house in the same society etc etc. The authors compare to dizygotic twins, where environment heritability would dominate over generic heritability. The dizygotic twins scored with correlation coeff 0.26 (CONFP) and 0.14 (CONFM). With these numbers environment is the dominant heritability factor. The authors do not provide an explanation/hypothesis why with DZ twins these two tests would provide such significantly different outcomes. And just like with gender, they do not regard that inconsistency in their genetic testing.<br>4) The authors dismiss other papers that found zero heritability, when accounting for environment heritability, gender and age (where it was found that increasing age = increasing conformity with strong correlation coeff). While they themselves, neither in the twin studies nor in the genetic testing, control for gender or age which might have lead to a result that confirms the findings of that other study.<br><br>The genetic testing:<br><br>1) &quot;Results showed that about 17.8‚Äì37.6% of the phenotypic variance in conformity could be &#39;explained&#39; by all autosomal SNPs&quot; .. meaning: environment is by far the dominant factor.

So I don&#39;t understand how they arrived at those 4% or what that actually means in the grad scheme of things.

 Collective stupidity often comes from fear of ostracism. You have to understand how intimidated everybody is to speak truth to power. We all saw the firefighters talk about ‚ÄúMolten steel, running down the channel rails, like you‚Äôre in a foundry, like lava.‚Äù It is etched into my brain. Also: ‚ÄúIt started popping out, boomboomboomboomboomboom!‚Äù <br><br>We do not publicly honor these heroes because we are all afraid of our pensions. So sad. Yet, every Highschool educated American knows about, or at least has heard about, Newton‚Äôs laws of motion. The third law states that action equals minus reaction. When body A exerts a force F on body B, then body B exerts an equal but opposite force -F on body A. You can feel it when you push a door closed with just one finger. You feel the door pushing back equally. <br><br>The North Tower, first hit, collapsed in about 10 seconds. Given from which height h it started to collapse, you can compute its downward acceleration a, using the formula <br>h = 0.5‚Ä¢a‚Ä¢t¬≤ . <br>We find that a was about 6.5 m/s¬≤ or about two thirds of freefall acceleration of 9.8m/s¬≤. This is the smoking gun! It means that the remaining damaged construction was exerting an upward force of about one third of the weight of the collapsing bit to retard its downwards acceleration by about a third. Here it comes. According to Newton‚Äôs third law this means that the collapsing part was exerting a force of only a third of its weight (!!) on the as yet undestructed part of the building, the constructive steel of which wasn‚Äôt heated by any fire and hence not weakened at all.<br><br>Also, the building was engineered according to 1970 building codes, to be able to carry 5 times the weight of everything above every floor. So a building engineered to carry 500% of all of the weight above was pulverized by a force of just 33% of that weight? If you believe that, you‚Äôll believe everything the government ever tells you, plus all commercials and all second hand car salesmen. <br><br>Don‚Äôt believe me, ask anyone who studied physics to verify what I just said. The firefighters, and the victims that they couldn‚Äôt save, deserve we start telling each other the truth.
