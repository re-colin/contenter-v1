 The Acorn Atom uses the &#39;#&#39; to represent a hexadecimal number, not the &#39;$&#39;, the &#39;#&#39;  (hash/hex) makse much more sense.<br>I still use this when writing hexadecimal number, i never use the &#39;$&#39; sign for that.

 If Blitz! actually compiled into p-code, then it compiled it into machine language for a virtual machine. The virtual machine concept is used in Jave, Python, Smalltalk, etc‚Ä¶<br>The reason it runs faster is that the p-machine is a better architecture than the actual hardware.<br>Look at the Western Digital Machine. They just changed to microcode from PDP-11 to Wirth&#39;s P-Machine. The throughput tripled on the exact same architecture.

 People who code in ML and claim to be mortals, are being modest.<br>A half century ago, I wrote a ml subroutine to quickly clear my C64&#39;s high res screen of garbage. I worked!  I was enrolled in a vocational programming course at the time...higher level languages.  But, a half century later I can&#39;t believe I figured it out.<br>I&#39;ve only recently become aware of QB64, which has been around for, like a decade?  Running the some code in BASIC, that I&#39;ve run on an actual C64, it completes hundreds of times faster on QB64 running on a modern PC.  It&#39;s compiled BASIC, but you don&#39;t get that speed increase running compiled BASIC on a C64.  QB64 looks to take advantage of my Windows PC&#39;s speed.

 Ah, the nostalgia! This takes me back to studying Computer Science in the late 80s and very early 90s! Writing interpreted code on the Sinclair ZX81 and Acorn/BBC Micro B, then progressing on to Pascal, C and ML itself.   They teach little of the fundamentals these days: Little about hardware or the abstraction layer. Really enjoyed this trip down memory lane. Thanks.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=16m03s">16:03</a> I think the memory mapped chips thing must be a 6502 thing. On the Z80 there are the commands IN and OUT that address ports where you might access a joystick or a soundchip or something. It might be better if everything was just addressed as memory I&#39;m not sure but I don&#39;t think everything does it in the same way. This may be down to the simplicity of the 6502. It was an incredible breakthrough microprocessor at a price people could afford.

 My first computer was an Atari 400 with 16K of ram (not common at the time). The first computer language I learned was Atari Basic. At the time so many magazines really dished dirt on Atari Basic, mostly because 1) it was very slow  2) it didn&#39;t have string arrays. I later bought the source code to Atari Basic and found out how really SUPERIOR it was in many ways to MS Basic. When one would enter a line of code it would compile it into P-Code; many years before other basics did that. And the person who owned the company who wrote Atari Basic showed that if one used the features Atari Basic had to offer, one could write adventure games for more easier and with far less memory use.

 When I went to college back in 1979, I was majoring in computer science. I took a class in assembly language.  I was so bad in it. I had no idea what the heck I was doing. When I would run my program I would get 200 to 300 sheets of pure garbage. Some pages were blank. Some had a single character. Some were almost black from printing repeated on the same lines. It was a disaster. I finally asked for help from a teaching assistant and found I had reversed a couple of characters and totally screwed up a few dozen lines of code. That class was not a success for me.

 Assembly language is essentially the same as machine language but vastly easier to use.  Real, actual machine language (but not the &quot;microcode&quot; on the chip itself) is incredibly difficult to get into the machine.  Altair 8800 used switches for that purpose and it was grueling just to get a tiny little program loaded by hand.<br>ASM was king of the hill for a long time; WordStar was written in assembly language.  Fast, compact and either perfect in every way or incredibly buggy and near impossible to debug.  <br>Then one day Borland Turbo C optimized one of my algorithms to be more efficient than I had written in ASM (a sorting routine) and so I haven&#39;t done ASM since then.  It still has a place for device drivers where you are handling interrupts and things like that.

 I have been writing assembly language code for over 30 years now. It&#39;s the only language that I know, and I still love it! I design a lot of embedded stuff, and write all the code in assembly.  In fact, many years ago, I designed a timer system for my home recording studio that had 16 outputs, and could time events to the 1/100th of a second. I wrote all the code in machine code. At the time... I had no idea what a compiler was because I taught myself how to do this. I used to go through lots of paper!

 I went to work for IBM in 1957 as a Field Engineer on the Air Force SAGE computer. I knew the machine language but never wrote anything in it. What little programming I had to do I wrote in Assembler. In 1966 IBM transferred me to Fla to work at Kennedy Space Center. It was there I became a programmer, again writing in Assembler. In 1971 I was moved again to Boca Raton to work on the development of the IBM System-7. Still in Assembler. I was writing diagnostic software. In about 1978 I joined the IBM Series-1 development but now writing application software still in Assembler. It wasn&#39;t until about 1985 that I was writing application software for the PC but now in C. I retired in 1991 having never written anything in any language more advanced than C. I haven&#39;t written a line of code since. I spend my free time in my woodworking shop.

 In the early 1980s, I had gotten hold of the BASCOM libraries which were required to nake the BASIC compiler work.  I was showing my two young sons the difference in speed between interpreted and compiled BASIC, with a short program that counted from 1 to 10,000, and printed ‚Äúdone‚Äù.  At the same time, I was given a copy of the Desmet C Compiler, which fit on a 5-1/4‚Äù floppy diskette.  I wrote the same program in C, ran it, and. . .HOLY CRAP.  Although I had already written a number of profitable BASIC programs for Typesetting and Xerox 9700 Laser Printing applications, after that short C program, I NEVER touched BASIC again.

It‚Äôs different, but very similar (i.e. ‚ÄúPRINT‚Äù became ‚ÄúDisp‚Äù, the line numbers got removed, etc.)<br><br>They still run slower than modern machines because:<br>1.

 I would imagine all the machines had some version of an assembler. For my Tandy model 200, I wrote my own assembler (8085). First, I wrote the assembler in BASIC. Then I rewrote the assembler in assembler as the final code. I even wrote a debugger so that I could walk my code the way I did on the mainframe.

Any real musician (especially one with classical education) worth ones salt can convert music back to sheet music by ear. Ok, a symphony would be laborious due its size and amount of instruments but working by one instrument at the time it would be perfectly doable - if one had looots of free time to do it. Modern pop music takes usually just minutes to decode back to notes. ;)

 Wow, does this bring back memories. I used to do extensive BASIC programming on the Commodore 64, and then moved into writing assembly language programs. Can&#39;t remember the names of the assemblers I used. I know one was just a short utility for writing very short code that was written by some famous guy I think that wrote for some of the computing magazines of the day back in the &#39;80s. Then for full-fledged programs, there was a full-fledged assembler that was very popular. That&#39;s been so long ago I can&#39;t remember the names. Here you used something called Monitor. That one does not ring a bell and does not sound familiar to me at all.<br><br>And other big thing back then was writing hybrid programs. Parts that didn&#39;t require speed were written in BASIC. For parts of a program that required speed, you would place machine language somewhere in memory and then write a SYS command to run it. When it completed, it would return back to the BASIC portion. Parts that required machine language typically was anything involving writing to the screen, and telecommunications.

 Back in the 1960s I operated and programmed both an 8K EMIDEC 1100 computer.  It was used extensively by a large company to do things like calculate the payroll for eight thousand employees, math modeling for petroleum cracking plants and physical inventory.  Everything was written in machine code but some programs still took days to execute.  We replaced the EMIDEC with an IBM 360 Model 40 with 64K.  It was not the panacea we anticipated as half the memory was consumed by the operating system and the MTBF was measured in hours.  But now we learned to use Assembly language.  Cobol and Fortran were used the the commercial application programmers but we &#39;system programmers&#39; used Assembly to create &#39;tight&#39; code that executed faster.  My favorite instruction was the BXLE, Branch on Index Low or Equal.  I loved writing tight loops using &#39;Bixlees&#39;, without explanatory remarks in the source code.  Keep &#39;em guessing how it works.  Today&#39;s software does little computing it seems.  It is all about painting screens for video.  So sad to see phenomenal computational power idling along painting games or streaming trash TV programs.

 Awesome video! Does anyone else want to start programming in assembly now or is it just me? :) I took a course in high school (circa 1987) where I learned programming in assembly using a Heathkit and a keypad for entering the instructions. It was fun, but we weren&#39;t trying to do anything like run games. I believe the Heathkit used a 65xx series processor, not sure if it was 6502. I&#39;ve tried unsuccessfully to locate this heathkit online although I&#39;ve had no problem finding the learning materials!<br><br>Btw, I do wonder if at least some device drivers are still written in assembly for optimization on &quot;dumb&quot; devices. Also, though, they might not do it anymore, I believe that C includes some assembly instructions (via direct memory addressing insertion) to speed up instructions that the compiler might not optimize optimally. But that info might be outdated, too. Compilers have come a long way and hardware even more so.

 So got a question, pretty new at this and everything about coding, so I&#39;m pretty lost on technical terminology etc, but I was asking my coding nerd friend how to make actual code anywhere to go from just text to actually something that... does something, anything, on your PC. I was asking that because I wanted to understand how to go from writing letters and numbers as just symbols in a text document, into making actual working programs, where is the bridge between those two things. And he told me you need a compiler, so for example visual studio which among other things can compile your code, say something written in C++, and make an exe from it, which then can actually do something on your PC.<br>I asked for a direct example like: Write code in C++ ---&gt; compile C++ code into ??? -----&gt; ??? ------&gt; functional program<br>He gave me: c++ source &gt; each c++ file is compiled to asm &gt; all the asm is compiled to binary and linked to form the final executable<br>Then he linked me this video.<br><br>My question is, why is assembly language needed in that sequence. Why not just do c++ --&gt; binary, why does it have to convert to assembly language between these two languages? If you have to convert from 1 language into another, and then convert that new one into yet another one, wouldn&#39;t that take longer for your PC to do? I&#39;m trying to understand what makes this necessary for your computer to do. I assume it&#39;s made to be as fast and efficient as possible, but I don&#39;t get it. Is this just so that IF you have to open the code, it&#39;s easier to read? Or does it only convert the language once and then just reads it as binary, which it can&#39;t do directly from c++? Or is the answer something else? I really want to understand.<br>Thank you.

 Too many years ago:<br>Professor: &quot;Of course, a modern compiler generates far better code than the average assembly programmer...&quot;<br>Me: &quot;As if I would compare myself to the average!&quot;<br><br>Of course he thought that I&#39;m an arrogant a**, but I had built my first computer more than 15 years before I ever set foot into a lecture hall. All I had was a hexadecimal keyboard and machine code, plus a processor that allowed you to do some interesting things. BASIC never was a thing for me and writing machine code was just the natural order of things for me. Looking back, unknowingly jumping into the deep end may have been a hard start, but everything that followed was a walk in the park.<br><br>And I learned very early on the value of libraries. Some things may be tedious to implement in machine language, but that makes it even more worth the time to do it as good as you can and keep the routine for reuse in later projects. Over time you get a valuable and proven collection that grows with every program you write and allows you to concentrate on the new project, and not on the boring stuff. There are slower and less efficient ways to write software.

 Atari BASIC converted the code to p-code as you entered each line. This not only saved memory space, but allowed for much faster execution at run time. Just another way Atari BASIC was far superior to the Microsoft BASIC interpreter on the C-64.

 I cut my teeth on the Apple II.  My first project was to program the game Qubic, 3D Tic-Tac-Toe in a 4x4x4 cube.  There are 72 winning patterns in the 64 squares, and you can imagine how many logic loops it took to tally up what the player did and come up with the best machine response.  In Applesoft basic it took about 45 seconds.  Not knowing at the time that there was a built in &#39;mini-assembler&#39;, I re-coded the entire game in machine code.  Similar to your example, the computers response appeared before lifting your finger from the enter/return key.  I sold 1 copy at a Boston Applefest exhibition.  Thanks for the memories, nice presentation.

 This comment is setting aside the quick scripts that interpreted languages are good at, which also seem to run just fine because they are only really being compared to a human. <br>I&#39;m talking about serious software here. The attitude that modern hardware means everything is fast enough is a huge failing in the computer science community during the last decade. <br><br>Machines stopped getting faster but bloatware continues to grow based on totally outdated ideas of hardware growth that became prevalent during the 90s. And aging instructors are still dumping this crap into the heads of students so things just might be setting up for a market adjustment. <br>CPU speed increased about 50x from 1991-2001 but have only increased 2-3x from 2001-2021(per core) now they pile on more cores to keep up with Moore&#39;s law, but even at its best that is a poor substitute for speed, and with the present coding most software does a very poor job of utilizing what is availible. Now combine all that with the need for reducing power consumption both in mobile batteries and huge data centers.(Google uses more power than Las Vegas) <br><br>Now hand writing whole sections of machine code for modern high end (64bit) machines is not reasonable, partly because you don&#39;t really know what trickery Intel or AMD is doing inside the CPU and GPU and there aren&#39;t [published?] instructions for direct manipulation of cache or branch prediction. However, knowing how to read assembly produced by a compiler is still a going skill and knowing how cache and branch prediction functions is essential to getting good results from modern hardware, even when using a high level language. Also somebody needs to write the compiler for each instruction set.

 Hi Ben, can you point me in the right direction towards a book, or any resource that shows how we went from machine language to the first assembler or the first small part of an assembler that kept bootstrapping itself?  More specifically how text began to be represented in computing systems?  For instance the assembly program is a text file, and it&#39;s also saved as a .asm file on the system.   How in the world did we get from machine language to being able to represent text?  I understand characters are just 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.   For instance, Elements of computing systems will teach you how to write an assembler, but the tools already exist for writing and compiling programs and working with text representations in a computer.   Then their is the further problem of graphics and images that I don&#39;t understand.    Every resource I&#39;ve found is like, ok Assembly is 1 to one instructions in machine language....but your entering a program in characters, how the hell did that happen?  I can&#39;t find anything that explains the gap.   I hope this makes sense.  Thanks.

 I learnt 6502 as a teenager around 1980 and kind of parked it as a hobby became a profession. Then in the late 90s I got involved with large format printers. However fast you fed those beasts, if the head stopped moving for a fraction of a second the print got ruined. Luckily Apple and the AIM alliance came up with the G4 PowerPC. It had AltiVec vector programming commands, memory prefetch and a whole host of goodness. All that assembler skill came back in use. Intel had its equivalents. <br>I moved on to different areas in 2009, but those assembler skills sure came in use and knowing how to efficiently access memory to avoid cache stalls is still a useful skill - processors are fast, but memory still hasn‚Äôt picked up much pace.

 There is no difference how JAVA and C# works. Java is compiled into Java Bytecode and C# is compiled into CLR bytecode (Common Language Runtime). Then both are executed through Virtual Machine which can compile VM bytecode into machine code on the fly (it&#39;s called JIT - Jsut In Time compiler). In fact C# is Microsoft response to Java and works simillar to Java. Today we have 3 types of high level languages: interpreters, compilers and virtual machines (which is mix of compiler and interpreter). Most languages which were created as intepreted languages are VMs today.

 Thank you for bringing back memories for me. Back when I was in college in 1986, I wrote my first assembly language program on an Apple II+. Once we completed that learning process, we actually built a 1Mhz 6502 computer on a breadboard, which would these days now be considered a micro controller. We only used an 8 digit, 7 segment display matrix as our display. We wired up an EPROM, used as the ROM to store our code, an interpreter in this case, to be run on power up of the computer. We wired up the RAM, only 2K, considered a reasonable amount of space for our needs back in 1986. Of course we added a UART for IO to allow us to connect external peripherals such as a small keypad and a speaker. We had to actually program our main code in machine language. That&#39;s right, machine language! This was a tedious task, but it worked.<br><br>Then in 1987, I built a Time and Date card that was inserted into one of the internal slots in the Apple II+. The card had a battery to continue to keep time when the computer was turned off. I then used assembly language to program, stored on an onboard EPROM, to run a background task in the Apple II+ when it was turned on, which used and interrupt to constantly display the time and date on the upper right hand corner of the screen. That was a fun project!

 A correction: Java and C# are both compiled languages - they are essentially the same. While they aren&#39;t compiled into machine language native to exact CPU, but rather into bytecode (machine language for a virtual machine). So later on there is virtual machine that will convert bytecode into native ML for exact CPU. While since bytecode is highly optimized and VM is super efficient at converting it to native ML - Java and C# has significantly better performance compared to interpreted languages.

 A thing I&#39;d like to point out:<br>On a modern system, writing in assembly doesn&#39;t mean your application will be faster than it would be if you&#39;d have written it in C. In fact, unless you&#39;re a mega geek or use ancient compilers, C code written by yourself will probably outperform anything you could make in ASM. Also, Windows (and probably other operating systems, too) don&#39;t even allow you to directly talk to the hardware anymore (if your app&#39;s running in user space) for security reasons. The assembly code you write talks to the C libs of Windows.

 I never understood assembly language UNTIL I started working with Atmel&#39;s Attiny 8 bit MCUs. At first, I wrote my software using C, but then I realized the C libraries for what I needed were just poorly implemented wrappers for the MCU&#39;s assembly language instruction set. Once I realized that, I took to learn a bit more, dispensed with C, and started writing much of my software directly in assembly language.

 Excellent video! This brings back memories. Subbed!<br>As someone who has programmed a lot of assembly software in the 80&#39;s for the C64, there&#39;s a couple of things that would benefit from a little expansion. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=5m12s">5:12</a> assembly language isn&#39;t compiled - it&#39;s converted to machine code by a process known as assembly. This distinction is important to note - particularly for the way in which many assemblers &#39;of that era&#39; worked...your hand-written assembly program, literally, was a 1:1 version of machine code. Every assembly mnemonic op-code was converted to its machine language via a simple lookup table, a table which also determined the type of operand, where applicable (CLC, SEC, INX, etc have no operand). In these early days, the programmer would always know what the machine code output would be before assembly.<br>Confusingly (and I guess where we&#39;re seeing &#39;assembly as a compiled language&#39; in this video), some of today&#39;s compilers e.g. C++, through the compilation process, can also produce an assembly version output. But this is not hand written(huge distinction!!) - it&#39;s been generated from a high level language source i.e. C++  - the programmer isn&#39;t writing in assembly language.<br>In later years assemblers would offer increasing levels of macro abstraction together with machine code optimisations e.g. an assembly multiply or divide instruction by a power of 2 might get replaced by a faster rotate instruction. Depending on the use case (and for maximum speed), a pre-computed look-up table could also be used (used extensively in all those shoot-em-up&#39;s).<br>The primary focus with these early computers, particularly for games programmers, was in execution speed and program size. Today&#39;s extremely fast CPU&#39;s, GPU&#39;s and large RAM sizes, perhaps unfortunately, require programmers to pay much less attention the level of manual optimisations required in the past. <br>A word of caution, though, for compiled languages - don&#39;t assume the compiler will always produce the fastest possible machine code - manual assembly optimisation in certain time-critical loops (e.g. main game loop) is more common than you might think in today&#39;s AAA studios!

 There are a whole bunch of tradeoffs. Assembly is the fastest running code but it&#39;s not so easy to work with.<br><br>Compiled code is much easier to work with but the programs it creates.are never as good. C/C++ is probably one of the better languages. The source code when moved to another CPU needs to be compiled again. It has to be recompiled for each architecture and each operating system. Still it is the way things are done. Java is often used but C/C++ is better.<br><br>On my DOS computer of yesteryear I used to have Turbo C. I did a few things with it. I also had Turbo Assembler which created very fast programs. It was cumbersome to use but powerful.

 I wrote an assembler for the C64 in Basic, my version didn&#39;t have the monitor. So I could type an assembler routine as if it were basic (interestingly the op codes are stored as tokens, not ASCII). So once I had the assembler, the question was: what to do with it. So I wrote an assembler. It ran pretty slow, and, in fact I couldn&#39;t write the whole thing because it was taking almost 30 minutes to assemble just the symbol table. OK, so I assembled the symbol table and stored it then cut the symbol table part of the basic program out and used the machine version. Ran in seconds. I then wrote the next part. It took four phases, each time getting up to about 20-30 minutes and then integrating that part into the machine version. In the end I had the entire assembler in machine code and it assembled itself in 2 seconds. It is much faster!

 Actually compilers beat human beings at writing machine code for some years already. The Linux kernel used to have a lot of hand written assembly code that was only there for speed optimization. When someone rewrote these code parts in C and compiled them with a current C compiler, the resulting machine code turned out to be faster. Meanwhile all these <i>false</i> optimizations were removed from the kernel source as using C code is not only faster today, it is also much more portable and easier to read in case it still needs adoption for a system. Only when something cannot be written in C or there are special CPU instructions a compiler will not use on its own, the assembly code was kept. So writing assembly code by hand has nearly no advantage anymore. Some people think they are really good at it and have optimized far better than any compiler could ever do but they highly underestimate how good compilers have become in the last decade.

So you don&#39;t need to know how to read a particular keyboard chip or to get a character on screen, you just call the operating system or library, saying &quot;get me a character&quot; or &quot;write this character&quot;, and let the operating system for that particular machine worry about how it&#39;s actually done. When you run the program on another machine, it looks the same way for the program, even though the operating system and drivers might need to address different chip types at different hardware addresses.

I would argue tools like Ghidra allow for reverse engineering machine language back to high level code, and similar approaches have been successfully used to reverse Nintendo games back into source etc. I&#39;d also argue that assembly is not a high level language, its just got a linker, but its opcode is bound to the CPU architecture.

 &quot;6502 and Z80 are VERY different languages.....&quot; But, are they? I knew Z80 back in the 70s but know nothing about 6502 assembly. Yet, it&#39;s immediately familiar - moving stuff around a register set, compares, bit manipulations, rotates, jumps, ports; it&#39;s all basically THE SAME THING. Sure, there are differences in the DETAIL, register structures (the Z80&#39;s IX and IY are both very useful index registers, for example). If you know one ML, then you can quickly learn another - useful for microcontrollers (which weren&#39;t really around in the 70s).

 I have also heard the support given by the platform in compiled languages to be referred to as the &quot;run-time environment&quot;. When libraries are linked or loaded, the implementation is usually platform dependent, so we&#39;d refer to the runtime environment when describing the startup and teardown as well as library implementations. For example, if you disassemble a program written in C you can view all the instructions that are provided by this RTE.

 It&#39;s a difficult subject to explain - I liked the video very much!   But I feel the video shows more how machine language differs from assembly and higher level languages, not specifically HOW machine language works -- why the opcodes are what they are.  If there is a PART2, maybe show the actual difference in an ADD opcode instruction between 6502 and Z80 - they made different choices in whatever arrangement of bits.  But also as this video implies, the differences are more than just opcodes -- it&#39;s the number of registers and the order of the opcode parameters (or things like relative addresses vs absolute addresses), and also what specific addresses the system kernel uses for specific features (like the clock or cursor blinking and how much system interrupts cost).   A PART2 could also cover the system clock - at 1MHz (e.g. typical PET configuration), you get 1,000,000 cycles per second, each opcode has a different number of cycles.   There are other videos showing you can overclock the PET - which is interesting in that the clock rate is a subjective choice by the manufacturer, to ensure reliable execution in a variety of conditions (and the longevity of that processor).  But fundamentally this is why finding a concise sequence of instructions (relative to that system) to do the desired task is key to performance, and the difference between a &quot;blockbuster&quot; game and something more casual (except these days with oodles of cycles per second, and parallel cores, it&#39;s less of a critical concern).   PART2 could also explain that machine language wasn&#39;t just to save TIME, but also to save SPACE -- modern programmers don&#39;t think much about their code size anymore, but since code-size occupies RAM, it was a bigger deal back then.   I can clear the screen in 30 bytes, or do a system call to do it in 4 bytes -- on the PET.  That extra byte-space leaves room for strings or other program-logic.   Highly appreciate the time 8BitGuy puts into these videos, it&#39;s a lot of effort, he does it very well (especially those cuts from DrWho - that was a very defining episode for me as well, type those hex values correctly!! :) )

 Nither java nor C# are what you said they are.

This really threw me when I was trying to go from doing the BASIC example to the Assembly one.  C128 emulator does, as long as you don&#39;t GO64 of course!

 This video is a very nice primer on machine language and assembly. It would make a great intro video to the subject for a high school or college computer architecture class. It encapsulates all the main concepts in a neat, easy to understand package. Nice work!<br><br>BTW, you are completely correct on the use of hex vs. decimal. I never understood why most BASIC&#39;s of the time forced you to use decimal addresses instead of allowing the option of hex.

It is a very gentle, &quot;gloves on&quot;, introduction to assembly that I&#39;ve found very educational.

 C# and Java are not compiled to machine code.  They are compiled to an intermediate form, Common Intermediate Language (CIL) in C# and JVM bytecode in Java.  Of note, (C)python also converts from the text source code (.py) to an intermediary form (.pyc) using the <b>marshal</b> protocol.  <br><br>Why it&#39;s sorta true to say &quot;C# is compiled to machine code&quot; is <b>at runtime*, the C# runtime library (dotnet or mono) takes the CIL and compiles it *again*, piece by piece, to machine code, in a process called Just In Time (JIT) compiling.  Java, javascript, some python implementations, and some lisp implementations *also</b> use JIT compiling.  <br><br>Jit compiling comes with a &quot;warmup&quot; phase, where the program is run in interpreted mode and the runtime code is analyzed.  This can sometimes let it beat &quot;native compiled&quot; code <b>after</b> the warmup period, as the branch predictor has more information on what code paths are hot (and since JITting happens on each program run, it can optimize the same CIL to different program inputs when you have a multi-call program).

 If anybody wants to learn a bit of 6502 assembly and play around with it in a fairly user friendly environment, there&#39;s a great 6502 tutorial and emulator which runs right in your browser that can be found here:<br><br><a href="https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/">https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/</a><br><br>It&#39;s far from complete. For example, it doesn&#39;t cover interrupts. But it&#39;s enough that you can run simple games for the emulator and get enough of a grasp of it that you can move on to coding for the c128, which I think is the next easiest way to code 6502 assembly since it has a built in monitor that allows you to write and assemble assembly language for the system. However, due to some nuances, the code you learn in the tutorial probably won&#39;t work directly on a C128. That is, you won&#39;t be able to just copy it in and have it work the same. In part because they&#39;re two different systems. So a memory address on one, might do something completely different on the other. But the instructions will work the same. So loading a value into RAM address $0200 on the emulator will make a colored pixel appear in the upper left corner. Where on the C128, I&#39;m not sure what it does, but I don&#39;t believe it has anything to do with graphics.

 Going from one instruction set to another is really not that huge of a problem. All CPUs have instructions that do the same thing such as moving a byte into a register. The syntax is different and there are sometimes minor differences you have to be aware of but its really not that hard. There are cross compilers that do this for you btw. Actually hate the idea that keeps being repeated about &quot;machine&quot; optimized code being good. Just last night I needed a driver for a thouch pad and downloaded a file that was megabytes large. For a machine that has 8 GB of Ram and 3 Terabytes of Disk you might think &quot;who cares&quot; but my god... Have you run Window10 on anything not brand new? Its so slow its unusable. And all this abstraction between what the machine &quot;speaks&quot; and what humans enter... Its like having a room full of people that know two languges and you have to speak to #1 who translates to #2 to #3 until you get code the computer speaks. What really baffles me is what is &quot;easier&quot; about C or C++ or C# its not like its intuitive so you have the learning curve of that and you have to be ready for the next new improved C. Which will be C if you are dumb enough to start from scratch again. Anyway thanks for the videos, You make them interesting!

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=18m31s">18:31</a>: ASM is a lost art..... tell that to ROMHackers. They&#39;ve embraced ASM to do their romhacks, especially the guys over at Super Mario World Central (SMWCentral) I think it&#39;s called. You are pretty much forced into using ASM to modify old cartridge ROM games. But I&#39;ve seen some of the things that they can produce with that, and it&#39;s simply amazing. Another topic that you could potentially cover (though other youtubers have already, especially RGMEx), is writing code <i>within a game</i> which is called ACE or &quot;Arbitrary Code Execution&quot;, where you perform a series of steps to modify the game&#39;s memory and then trigger a glitch to execute that as code. This is usually done by causing the instruction pointer to jump out of bounds into random memory addresses, but the computer doesn&#39;t know the difference between that, and what was actually meant to be run as code because &quot;everything is RAM&quot; to the CPU. Normally programmers are careful with their JMPs, but sometimes they leave glitches that people find decades later that let you do crazy things with certain games. Such as using Pokemon.... Yellow, was it? to write certain values to a gameboy&#39;s memory... then yank the game out but leave the gameboy still running and plug SML2 in, hop in the pipe in the title screen and voila, end-of-game credits warp. If this kind of stuff existed for NESs, Gameboys, and Super Nintendos.... surely there are Commodore/Amiga/etc games that had similar glitches.

 Regarding C# and .NET in general it does not compile the code, but works same as Java, this is from Wikipedia:<br>CLI assembly language has nothing to do with actual assembly, it is high level language and JIT compiler is not compiler that produces native but CLI code - CIL is object-oriented, stack-based bytecode.<br><br>The execution process looks like this:<br><br>1. Source code is converted to CIL bytecode and a CLI assembly is created.<br>2. Upon execution of a CIL assembly, its code is passed through the runtime&#39;s JIT compiler to generate native code. Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates this step, but at the cost of executable-file portability.<br>3. The computer&#39;s processor executes the native code.

 Java isn&#39;t that slow interpreted language anymore like it was in the 90s! It&#39;s &quot;JIT-compiling&quot; (like C# do): The compiler compiles in into an intermediate byte code (in a similar way the blitz basic thing does, but thing more of a fictive machine language) in a very &quot;stupid&quot; way (low optimizations etc). This is, what&#39;s inside of the .jar file you get from the compiler. When you execute that .jar, the byte code inside gets compiled again to the final machine language of the machine at runtime. Even it&#39;s compiled twice, this approach has two big advantages: 1) The second compiler knows the machine and the OS where it&#39;s running on. 2) The compiled machine code only needs to support this! So it can do heavy optimizations here. The result the CPU will see can perform better than precompiled binaries because no code is needed to support more than one system/OS. And yes, that advantage is nullified by the fact that it&#39;s object-oriented &quot;ravioli-code&quot; takes some overhead :). In contrast: Interpreted languages do, what you explained: parse &quot;GOTO&quot;, parse &quot;20&quot;, Jump... parse &quot;GOTO&quot;, parse &quot;20&quot;, Jump once more...

 One thing about Commodore (Microsoft) BASIC is that it tends to use some bastardized floating point number for EVERYTHING.  Even if you specify an integer with %, it converts to the internal floating point format.. cuz..reasons.  Except line numbers; I believe those stay as integers (hence the 2-byte limit).    And those are slow, especially in the pre-FPU days, on a machine trying to choke on a 5-byte single number with a 1-byte data bus.   Also decimal-to-integer is a bit slow (although not as slow as decimal-to-float) compared to hex-to-integer.  hex to integer is lookup/comparison or-and-shift, no need for divides or modulus or such (which doesn&#39;t exist on 6502 IIRC, so would be even more operations to perform).

 I saw the disclaimer before rushing to the comments section, and I was thinking that such commenters already said this but Java and C# are compiled languages, but into bytecode instead of straight to machine language. The bytecode is then compiled into machine language at runtime through JIT compilers, meaning it&#39;s basically interpreted language. Python is also this if you&#39;re using PyPy, which Blitz reminds me of, and all of which (PyPy, Java, C#) are pretty much what Blitz is performance-wise

 C# is a language that is compiled into MSIL which is not machine code but an intermediate language. MSIL is executed on the Common Language Runtime which JITs it into machine code native to the machine it&#39;s running on during execution. As a result, managed DLLs and EXE&#39;s are encoded in MSIL and can pretty easily be decompiled into C# that is just a little syntactically verbose but still easily readable.

 I really wish I hadn&#39;t decided that computers are too complex to understand how they work. Unfortunately that&#39;s what I decided when I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s. It&#39;s only in the last few years I&#39;ve started to learn how computers or shall I say CPUs actually work and it turns out they are extremely logical (shocker, I know=) and actually not that complicated at all. I remember programming in the 90s on my high school calculator with a z80 in BASIC but struggling to optimising the code to be fast enough. I knew Assembly was an option but thought it was going to be way too hard to understand. I had learned BASIC by listing programs written by my older sisters classmates followed up by the manual of my calculator but thought to program in Assembly you needed to be much smarter than me. I had listed some assembly programs I had managed to download on to it, but didn&#39;t realise at the time it was the machine language I was getting. Not assembly. Soon 30 years later I realise it might have lead me down a different path in life and I&#39;m now very tempted to finally learn how to program the my z80 in Assembly. If only I had the time now...

So the person writing the compiler needs to know how to code the particular task in assembler to be able to write the translator.']

 Good job! I&#39;m surprised the retro community is not more interested in FORTH. That is a very different idiom that allows high-level programming with machine-language speeds.  It was used in many arcade game consoles in the early days and is particularly good for optimized graphics programming. A FORTH program is just a series of pointers to machine language routines. You program by adding new words to a the starter set in the language spec. New words act just like built-in words. Sets of words are grouped into vocabularies which are switched in and out to handle large-scale tasks. This is a very beautiful system once you get the hang of it, and much more abstract and portable than assembly code while still running at essentially machine language speed.

 Interesting video! Around 30 years ago, and after i got bored with BASIC on my C64, i started investigating more into machine code. I had no technical books, only the default programmer&#39;s guide and a handfull of Zzap! magazines with cheat codes and small blocks of machine code to run after reset. So i started SYSing the ROM using instruction with code 60 (RTS) as the &#39;end&#39;, and using BG color register i started infering the existence of registers and all the addressing modes. The insctructions are related to their low and high nibble values, and you could see easily this arrangement of op codes by looking at them in a tabular (16 x 16) way. I gave names to these operations (only much later to find out the real names). Some of the inscructions were kind of exotic (NOOps). 0 (BRK) had no effect i could determine a name for and, and 2 others instructions caused always my machine to freeze, and much later i realized why:  they messed up the stack and program counter

 Just one little thing, Java is not interpreted, it&#39;s compiled to Java Bytecode, and then it runs on JVM, so it&#39;d be kind of interpreted after compiling, (should we say transpiling?) that&#39;s why Java performs really bad.<br><br>Oh fuck, I unpaused the video and you told that xD

 Knowing Assembly is a great asset to working with Microcontrollers.  Datasheets are register and memory intensive documents.  Have you ever seen how subtraction works in ML?  It&#39;s really and addition.  It&#39;s been a while, but I think it&#39;s done by taking the compliment of the 2nd number (in binary) adding 1 (negating the number) and just adding it.  The highest bit is lost.  5-3 = 2.   0101 - 0011 : 0101 - 1100 : 0101+ 1101 =10010  since we are working in 4 bits, we are left with 0010 (2). 1101 is -3 in the equation.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of that, I just thought I would put it out for a new comer.

 I&#39;m 42 and have just started programming, depending on how you define it. Never got far beyond &quot;hello world&quot; in C64 Basic. Momentarily looked at scriptless game editor programs on the Amiga in the early 1990s but didn&#39;t get anywhere. Then about 4 years ago I think, I decided to open up my Gamemaker program I had acquired from a Humble Bundle and create a simple click program to help prove a point (that two audio tapes that were suppose to match were saying something else by having the samples play side by side and inserting interference and distorting the audio). Since that point, I decided to create a basketball stats program in Gamemaker and then a music program (you can see a video of a Mozart piano sonata on music box in my uploads), but I had trouble migrating to C#. I think the two biggest hurdles that you need to get over is the fact that it is all nested and the way variables are made local/global with public/private/static/the way variables are returned and forwarded/etc. As soon as I cracked those two issues, I feel like I opened up the floodgates.

 A compiler and an assembler are two distinct stages. A compiler can use an assembler to assemble your assembly language files it generated. I think the terminology we usually use in modern CS now is : compiler - high level language, assembler - assembly language (what you call ‚Äúmachine language ‚Äú is either opcode (instruction), assembly (language) for processor specific instructions), object code or machine code for binary output, binary/executable for the linked object code - this is the bit you can execute. On older machines without an OS that supports the notion of exe files it‚Äôs a little more murky. Using ‚Äúcompile‚Äù for the assembly stage goes against normal usage.

 This was fascinating, thanks! Back in the day, I would stay up late keying BASIC programs into my Atari 400 from books that didn‚Äôt target Atari machines. I learned a lot. Then I took a data processing class at a local community college, in which we entered machine code into punch cards and executed them on a mainframe, with the output appearing on a huge dot-matrix printer. Yeah, really old-school for the mid-1980s; there were complaints from the class, along with suggestions that learning a higher-level language would make more sense. So the teacher explained that the language we were using had been a pet project of one of their IT faculty, and we were basically stuck with it. And the funny thing was, the class gave me a solid concept of what actually goes on under the hood. I learned things like not sending my outputs to the same memory space as my instructions, causing my program to eat its leg off and die, for example. All told, it was great fun. Again, thanks for all the great content!

 Java and C# work in a similar fashion.   They both compile the code into a bytecode, then require a VM to run it.  <br><br>Of course this depends on the implementation.  Android for example uses Java and the JVM, but since Android introduced ART (replacing Dalvik), Android ahead of time compiles your apps when you install them.  Then later they added some profiling so it can recompile it with optimisations on hot paths at runtime.  <br><br>So as you said it&#39;s all very complicated and the deeper you go the more the lines blur!   Perl for example will compile pieces of code then store the machine code version in memory.  it&#39;s even possible to dump those binaries to disk and cache them for later use (it&#39;s just awkward).  Or Python is interpreted with cpython, by pypy is a JIT.  Lots of shades of grey.<br><br>Love your videos mate!

 You can actually convert some forms of machine code back to high-level code, to an extent, with reverse engineering tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra. It&#39;s not a perfect conversion though. It&#39;s really more like pseudo code than something you can actually recompile and run.

 Hi, great video, I like your way of explain complicated things in plain language. Just a clarification, C# is like Java: the code is not 100% interpreted, it is compiled but to an intermediate representation called MSIL (or CIL in newest implementation). This intermediate language is like an universal machine code that is finally compiled to the real machine code in the first execution (in a run time environment). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language</a>.

 Yeah I was gonna say, it looks pretty bright in there.  You did answer a lot of my questions I had on Machine Language and honestly its nice to hear someone explain it without getting mad that you do not implicitly know what it is like some people have to me in the past.  One thing I wondered is if you have CPUs from the same manufacturer but different generations, like say a 6502 vs a theoretical 6555 (I know there&#39;s a 6510 but that&#39;s very similar and wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;d be different enough for the sake of my question) how much of that code remains backwards compatible or is it common for chip manufacturers of the era to completely rewrite how the machine language would interface with their CPU?

 I&#39;ve been a programmer since I was a teen, started with writing BASIC programs on paper (learned it form a series of articles in a pop-tech mag), just because my parents could not afford buying me a computer  then. Today, ML is pretty much dead in any software industry except really small and specialized disciplines, such as low-level drivers and abstraction layers, memory and task management primitives deep in the operating system&#39;s guts, boot loaders and system initialization routines, etc. Microcontrollers? Well, if you&#39;re forced to use really old hardware. New devices are built on insanely powerful SoCs for their size, compared to my early years - and it&#39;s the manufacturer of the chip or the supplier of your dev kit/compiler/platform that ever cares about ML. Do it once, do it well, and forget the complexity of modern hardware and ML. Last time I used my ML skills was ten years ago, debugging a program written in C for a signal processor, turned out to be a compiler bug. Yes, everything can have a bug. So ML skills can be useful still, but less and less as time passes. Oh, one discipline that always needed mastery in ML and still needs it is advanced hacking :-)

 I don&#39;t see the problem in explaining it:<br>Assembly is 1:1 translatable to machine code.<br><br>The only reason you can&#39;t just reverse it is you can only guess which part is instructions by following execution. But that&#39;s the thing there was never a difference. If formatted incorrecty you can easily run into asset data and in the best case the first byte is not a valid OP Code. Worse case: that happens later.<br>Or in other word:<br>Even a random Jpeg file will randomly contain bytes that might look like opcodes. And without the assembly source you could only simulate instruction and guess based on which bytes are never attempted to execute to guess if those things are not code.<br>An assembly program can and will run into not executable bytes on small mistakes. On IBM Mainframes that throws an S0C1.<br><br>So you could actually see the source files as a form of documentation. As you only really need it to derive a better sense of intentions.

 Java doesn‚Äôt run in an interpreter. It is compiled to byte code and that byte code is executed. This can be anywhere from run instruction by instruction to being whole sale JITted to Machine Code. But, Java is always compiled to byte code. The Java VM generates instructions and optimises the compiled code to Machine Language instructions.

 C# also runs through an interpreter; it does not compile to machine language, but just like Java, it compiles to a byte code which is run on a runtime. The Java runtime is called JRE, and the C# runtime is called CLR. Java and C# are designed in exactly the same way when it comes to machine code.

VBScript is BASIC that is interpreted. Java and C# are compiled languages, that compile to an interpreted code - and C# can be compiled natively as well, and there are Java bytecode-to-native compilers. The only easy part of Java and C# is that you don&#39;t have to bother as much with cleaning up memory (though unloading the garbage collector is also an art on itself). These languages are NOT easy if you&#39;re using it in a more advanced way (with things like multithreading, deadlocks and race conditions, generics and polymorphism, and processing big data). With C# and Java, you can really make speedy code, and you can make slow code with C. It&#39;s all a matter how you approach a problem. <br>Btw there were  java bytecode processors made in 2000s that ran Java applications natively. These were dedicated for mobile devices (maybe a nice topic for another video?)

 Nice introduction, well done!<br><br>BTW, the Amstrad CPC BASIC had similar properties to Blitz! - The BASIC editor reserves space in the code to have numbers stored in their binary representation, they don&#39;t have to be parsed again and again. Line numbers are directly stored as integers, and if you GOTO a line, the line number is looked up in memory and then the number after the GOTO is replaced by the line&#39;s address in memory, making the next GOTO much faster.  (This is why a &#39;BREAK&#39; into a long BASIC program sometimes takes a bit - before it prints &#39;READY&#39;, the BASIC interpreter reverts this optimization, for editing lines you need their numbers. For-next-loops also stored the numbers and even the address of the for &#39;counting&#39; variable, etc. Quite nifty!

 In my C64 days, I knew a guy who wrote a game in machine language and I asked him to teach me. From scratch, I wrote a program, directly in machine language, that would &#39;read&#39; Morse Code! I cannot remember the details, but I somehow connected something to a joystick input that my program would detect as being ON or OFF (zero or one). My routine would compare the timing of dits and dahs to a Morse Code lookup table and I actually made it work! I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m a ham radio operator (KK5DON) and I would tune around the CW (&#39;Continuous Wave&#39; or &#39;tones&#39; or &#39;Morse Code&#39;) band and my C64 would print out to the screen what letters the Morse Code operator was sending.

The next question was &quot;why write in ML when BASIC was so readable?&quot;  I then wrote a program to poke a character to all screen locations and then poke the next character etc. in both ML and BASIC.  Showing the speed difference and explaining why made for a very good class, with most students signing up for the next level course.  Thanks for the memories.

 Wow! This was a surprisingly comprehensive overview.<br>The very first computer programs I ever wrote were in IBM 360/370 Macro Assembler.<br>It was the introductory &#39;wash-out&#39; course at the local tech school.<br>The macro facility only meant that we didn&#39;t have to construct our own print routines, a massive time saver.<br>The idea, of course,  was that we would learn how the computer really worked on a basic level before we moved on to COBOL.<br>I got an Atari 800 because of the superior graphics. The Atari really got me right into 6502 machine language. We used some of those peeks and pokes like you did on the Commodore, but not nearly so much because Atari Basic has built-in graphics and sound commands.<br>Unfortunately, every number in Atari Basic is floating point (even the line numbers!) and there is a bug in the Basic floating point routines that make it very slow.<br>This pretty much forced us to get under the hood, especially if we really wanted to get control of those custom graphics and sound chips.<br>We didn&#39;t have a monitor, we had the Atari Assembler Editor cartridge.<br>But often we would completely bypass that. The ATASCII characters has a printable character at every one of the 256 positions, so that a machine language subroutine could be loaded into a Basic string and called with USR(ADR(MLSUB$)). Atari Basic strings are a lot more like strings in C, just long stretches of characters up to 32K in length. Basic often moves strings around in memory so such code has to be fully relocatable: no jumps to specific addresses within the program, only relative branches.<br>I seriously learned everything I ever needed to know about computers on that old Atari.

This would set all the address, data and control lines to a known repeating pattern which I could then look at using an Oscilloscope and isolate the bad chip or shorted lines or whatever caused the issue.

 I think David should stick to explaining 8 bit computers, cause he said many inaccuracies which can&#39;t be circumvented by leaving a preemptive notice on his video about it not being black and white. First of all java is a compiled language, it complies to byte code which is then converted by the Java virtual machine into machine language. C# is not compiled directly into machine language, &quot;C# is compiled into byte code, just as java is, but. NET wraps this in a CLR executable. C# code is compiled to MSIL. ... msil will be converted to machine instructions at run time&quot;, just a little investigation on google reveals this, I expect better out of my 8 bit guy... python uses a just in time compiler./ I think he should have picked a few languages that are definitely compiled directly into machine language like C or pascal, and then chosen a few languages that are definitely interpreted like BASIC or early versions of perl, I guess there are few purely interpreted languages and that is why he did this, but he should have just said the truth. I call for a second video amending this problem...

 Back in the 80s I was writing assembler for the ZX Spectrum and other Z80-based micros, and if you think 6502 code looks hard, the Z80 had a huge instruction set and add to that the fact that lots of games at the time used undocumented opcodes for one reason or another (usually performance or various &quot;clever&quot; stuff), the whole thing was a proper headache a lot of the time :)

 handbrake is actually still written in part in assembly for x86 cpus. which we saw clearly with the launch of the M1 macs.<br><br>machine language and assembly still has a place in modern coding but you only code very exact segments of you code this way, since that was so bottle necked it was slowing down the entire rest of the code to a crawl. if you can speed that up 100 times it is no longer the bottleneck.

 Erg... not quite. Java is not &quot;interpreted&quot; in the classical way. And there&#39;s no real difference between Java and C# in terms of how they work: if you consider one interpreted, so you should consider the other, or vice versa for compiled. Also, Java is compiled in bytecode, and compiled (again) in native ML by the JIT-compiler. So, not really interpreted.

 I enjoy these 8-bit technical videos. Back in the early 80s I had a Apple II+ then Apple IIe and learned  8-bit assembly. There was a Apple II program called MacroBasic (I think that was it Name) for DOS 3.3. It was a collection of 6502 assembly macros for the Merlin assembler. The macros were a subset of Basic commands that handled for-next loops, go subs,  String handling, disk IO,  Sound, print commands, etc. This more-or-less let someone create Basic-like programs that ran at the full speed of assembly language because it was 100% ML code,  not op code. I believe it did called ROM routines for some functionality (ie Disk IO).  What was so cool was I could write a Macro Basic program and then see what the final 6502 assembly code looked like once assembled.

 C# and Java are both interpreted. Both are basing on VM concept. The difference is that VM are basing on different logical machines i.e. JVM uses State Machine concept. What I mean, C# as well as Java is first transpiled by JIT to intermediate language - CL - which is executed by CLR, and in case of JVM it is Java-bytecode, and then this is translated to system calls. None of those languages &quot;ends up&quot; as ML directly. The only part of their ecosystems in ML directly is a VM software.

BNE/BEQ acts on the state of the zero flag, that is how BNE/BEQ &quot;get&quot; the &quot;result of CPX/CMP/etc, but as INX also sets the zero flag, the CPX #$00 actually does &quot;nothing&quot;).

 I predate the 6502 by a number of years. Starting as a hardware tech on the IBM 1401 and later on the similar but more capable Honeywell 200 series I had to learn machine language in order to troubleshoot and repair these CPU&#39;s (back then if a CPU failed you had to fix it). On these machines the term byte wasn&#39;t used since the memory locations were 6 bits. The 1401 used an odd alphanumeric addressing scheme resulting in coredump representation that took a while to learn to read  The Honeywells on the other hand used a two character octal representation that was much easier to decipher. When I started programming 360&#39;s, being accustomed to octal, I had a bit of difficulty with the new-fangled hexadecimal in the assembly listings.

 I started programming in BASIC and then Forth, but after seeing what a compiler could do I decided to earn Machine Code. I learned 6809 Machine code in 1984 using nothing but the Motorola opcode list which was a single piece of fanfold paper. I couldn&#39;t afford an assembler so I wrote in hex for about a year before I was able to get an assembler.

 I enjoyed this video, it&#39;s a great topic and illustrates how BASIC relates to machine language on these retro machines. A few suggestions, though: ML typically refers to &quot;machine learning&quot;, not machine language. Also, Java is not an interpreted language (like Python or BASIC). Java is compiled into byte code, that runs on a virtual machine (called the JVM.)

 Small comment on the second piece of assembly code: the CPX instruction (appeared at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=9m40s">9:40</a>) is not necessary, INX instruction actually affects the Z flag.

 Love the video!<br>One correction though: Java is a compiled language, not interpreted, Javascript is interpreted.<br>Java runs in a Virtual Machine to the bytecode of which it is compiled, meaning it does require the an additional piece of software, but that doesn&#39;t make it interpreted any more than C# which also requires additional software, and only truly becomes machine code when the compiled executable is run and a JIT Compiler takes advantage of optimisations specific to the machine it&#39;s being run on to produce the most efficient end result.<br>It&#39;s a strange generalisation to make, if you consider one compiled, you should consider both compiled, and i don&#39;t fully understand the reasoning behind the need for this generalization in the first place. Java and C# are by all definitions, compiled. 

 	Replies: ['Nilstrieb', '@J R Yes like I said, it&#39;s compiled but still interpreted.', 'J R', '\u200b@Nilstrieb The source code is &quot;prepped&quot; and &quot;compiled to an intermediate form,&quot; but it&#39;s not getting turned into machine code like C.  No java instructions run on the processor, because the processor doesn&#39;t know a thing about java&#39;s higher order concepts like classes and heaps.  A C compiler has these concepts as well, but by the time the executable is produced, those concepts are gone -- they&#39;ve been turned  into machine code, ready to run.', 'Nilstrieb', 'I&#39;d say Java (and C#) is compiled interpreted. It&#39;s definitly both.', 'Dennis Krenz', '@J R Yes, Java and C# are actually rather between both worlds there. Essentially, the idea in both languages was, to separate the two major components of a compiler, frontend and backend, so that the translation is finished on the machine, where the program is running. Between frontend and backend, you always have had an intermediate language that was closer to machine language already, but still contained many high-level instructions to control the final translation into machine language for the target (Like LLVM or CLang as example there). Both Java and C# are never 100% machine language, even when optimized by a JIT, since there is always the byte-code interpreter lurking in the background, waiting for something making it useful again (For example, when you run a script in an embedded scripting language, that gets translated into bytecode). Still, after some runtime and optimizations, both are essentially mostly machine language functions being called by a machine language runtime environment based on binary data structures that tell the runtime what should be called with which inputs and outputs. Its sure not as fast as assembly language programs can become in machine language by using a human brain to remove every check or accuracy that isn&#39;t necessary because the human (hopefully) knows the context in which the program will be executed, what the compiler can&#39;t know (unless a human explains it = programming). But fast enough for managers and accountants (The final 1% of optimization takes 99.99% of the time). And faster as bad assembly language programming as well. Of course, when the human gets the context wrong, we see really epic bugs, because all that slow extra checks, garbage collection and error handling serve a purpose. But thats something C and C++ can also do with your plans....', 'J R', '@Alvaro S. This is absolutely correct.  I&#39;ve been writing Java since the 1.0.2 days, and this is exactly what happens.  It gets compiled into bytecode, which is <b>loosely</b> analogous to assembler, and then at runtime the JVM interprets that bytecode.  If you contrast the bytecode instructions with something like a physical processor has, you can readily see that they are at a higher level than processors have.  Processors have no concept of a &quot;class&quot; but the JVM certainly does. Processors have no concept of a &quot;heap&quot; but the JVM certainly does.  Processors have no concept of code verification and security, but the JVM certainly does.  Java is <b>way</b> closer to a traditional interpreted language than it is to C for example.']

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=18m08s">18:08</a> Machine language at the time could be reversed to a high level language, but not necessarily the original source code. When I was a kid (PC/XT), I did come across a software called &quot;De-Compiler&quot;, which takes in the .EXE file and reverse it back to a text file with BASIC language. I did tried to use some BASIC compiler to create the executable .EXE file, from a BASIC program I wrote. Using that De-Compiler, it did restored the BASIC language program in text, although it is not the original BASIC I wrote. That has something to do with the .OBJ and other library files the compiler linked into the .EXE, and all the variables becomes a generic named variables. Although it is in BASIC language syntax, the exported BASIC code became very long and difficult to read/understand by human eyes. For .EXE files that were originally written in other languages, it can also de-compile back to BASIC language. It is a kind of reverse engineering from the machine codes of the .COM/.EXE file. Later on I remembered all compiler did something about it and made the de-compiler no longer possible.

 Is there not emulators that give more memory that C can be compiled into the ASM for to test the code? The ASM can just be manually optimized for the real deal afterwards once one is happy the code functions the way that is expected, albeit not at either the memory or speed efficiency needed for the real deal.

 Great video. Just one correction: A program which converts assembly language to machine code is called an assembler, not a compiler. 

 	Replies: ['Brenton Jackson', 'I understood what he meant because it&#39;s a very high level video not explaining internal processes. I assumed he meant compiler as just a translator from one language to another, which an assembler does - leaving out the linker bc of the aforementioned brevity due to context.', 'Brenton Jackson', '@Steel String you&#39;ve written an assembler and a compiler?', 'Steel String', 'Yep. And when you do that, you &quot;assemble&quot; the program rather than &quot;compiling&quot; it.

 It&#39;s easy to make an assembler that recognizes decimal, and I think most modern ones do, if you mark the number as decimal (typically with a prefix or suffix); but it would not make <i>sense</i> to use decimal for a lot of the numbers you put in an assembly language program, especially things like memory addresses and offsets, bitfields and their corresponding flag constants and bitmasks, sizes of data structures, and so on.  Expressing those in decimal would lead only to confusion and pain, and the need to do a lot of otherwise-unnecessary mental arithmetic.  This is why even very high-level languages like Perl, which <i>normally</i> express numbers in decimal, almost always have syntax for expressing numbers in hex and/or octal.  Most of the numbers in a typical Perl program are the kinds of numbers it makes sense to express in decimal; but occasionally you want to express something more technical, with closer ties to the underlying hardware, and in those cases it&#39;s often very much preferable to express the number in hexadecimal.  Even markedly less technical things like Unicode codepoints and RGB color values are frequently expressed in hex.  When you&#39;re programming in assembly language (or, heaven help you, in machine code directly), you have a LOT of these kinds of more technical numbers, which are better expressed in hex.  It just makes sense for that to be an assembler&#39;s default number format, because most of the numbers in your program are going to be best expressed in that way.  And then the programmer gets used to that, and starts expressing numbers that way out of habit, and eventually turns into a huge nerd who can&#39;t even have a normal conversation with a normal person because they don&#39;t even know what FFFF means, the morons.

 Arrgh, I remember writing Z80 ML on a sinclair ZX81 by hand compiling the assembler then creating a REM statement with the characters which coded the instructions then calling the code in the rem statement (the ZX81 had characters for all 255 bytes). Then it crashed of course and you had to type in all in again... The joy when I finally had an assembler in later machines. <br>I think that if anybody wants to learn a useful assembly language then ARM maybe the one to learn as most things needing low level coding run on ARM these days (and the basic instructions have remained the same from 1990 to now).

 Not to pick too many nits, but C# and Java do the same thing - when you compile your C# and Java with your compiler suite, what comes out is machine code... for a virtual machine.  that virtual machine interprets the intermediate machine code into your native machine code (restrictions apply, see store for details).  So in a sense, C# (and any .NET language) and Java (and any JVM language) are both precompiled AND interpreted.

 The sequence INX ; CPX #0 ; BNE [somewhere] is two bytes longer than it needs to be. INX sets the N and Z flags according to the new value of X, and then CPX #0 sets those flags according to X minus zero, so it essentially doesn&#39;t do anything except perhaps clear the V flag, which we don&#39;t care about because BNE only looks at the Z flag. The CPX #0 can therefore be left out entirely, saving two bytes of machine code and two CPU cycles each time through the loop.

So, here&#39;s the post:<br><br>Ben&#39;s videos have been ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL in me realizing my dream of one day building a computer from scratch. I mean building one completely out of chips and other components. I love playing with this program called Logisim, which lets you build digital circuits of pretty much any size and complexity you can come up with from things like logic gates, RAM, counters, flip flops and other components. \r<br>\r<br>The first time I played with it, I told myself one day I would make a computer with it. Although I&#39;ve since learned how to build physical electronics and now have the means to build such circuits in real life. So my goal now is to make an actual breadboard computer, like Ben did. Though there are some things I would like to change.\r<br>\r<br>Anyways, if anyone wants Logisim, it&#39;s a free program. The page for it can be found here:\r<br>\r<br><a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">http://www.cburch.com/logisim/\r</a><br>\r<br>And in case you have trouble finding the download link, here&#39;s a link to the download page on sourceforge:\r<br>\r<br><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/\r</a><br>\r<br>Whether you just want to play around with digital circuits, or do some serious learning, or build a model of a full, working computer. I cannot recommend this program highly enough. It&#39;s been essential in my journey from being curious about computers but not even know what a transistor is or does to designing computer and CPU components and then building them in real life.\r<br>\r<br>And while I&#39;m at it, the other program that&#39;s been just as important is a circuit simulator called circuitmod, which is also free and runs in your browser, and it can be found here:\r<br>\r<br><a href="https://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/circuitjs.html">https://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/circuitjs.html\r</a><br>\r<br>This amazing program will allow you to build both analog and digital circuits. It simulates just about every electrical/electronic component you can imagine, resistors, capacitors, bipolar transistors, mosfets, jfets diodes, zener diodes, tunnel diodes, logic gates, 555 timers, various logic chips, and soooo much more. Plus it allows for a simulation of oscilloscope output that even includes a fast fourier transform of the output. Or it lets you export the wave form into a sound file, or raw data if it&#39;s a digital circuit. This program is superb for not not only building circuits, but for understanding how they work on an intuitive level by letting you see where current is going and what voltage everything&#39;s at at a single glance. It also has a ton of example circuits, which you could spend hours on end playing with and learning about.\r<br>\r<br> This program along with Logisim probably single handedly helped me transition from just screwing around on the computer, to building actual real life electronic circuits. Again, I cannot overstress how useful and fun both of these incredible programs are whether you just wanna have some fun, or do some serious learning.

 Very good and instructive video. Please take note that Java is not an interpreted language. Java and C# are compiled to an intermediate language.

I wrote many programs in machine language including some simple video games.  I thought in assembly and used a pencil and paper to keep track of my variables and routines.  For a complex 3D maze program, I actually wrote and debugged it in BASIC first and then manually converted it to machine language, speeding it up by a factor of 1000.

Also, by that time, I had memorized all of the opcodes simply by using them, so it was quicker to type in hexadecimal.  When I was starting out, I wrote my programs on paper first in assembly language using arrows to represent jumps, but as I got better, I was able to figure out the assembly code in my head.  For larger programs, I spread the routines out in memory so that I could more easily modify them during development.  Each routine, or closely related group of routines, was saved as its own file.

 Languages that compile directly to machine language can run faster than bytecode compiled languages. But the opposite also happens.<br><br>Languages with a bytecode interpreter can optimize the code while its running. It can do things like remove instructions that aren&#39;t needed for the data that it is actually getting. They can inline code.

This was also years ago, before many of the optimizations happened.<br><br>MoarVM also has a definable object oriented system, which allows it to inline even object oriented code.<br><br>It&#39;s also possible for a VM to tailor its JIT compiled code to the specific processor it&#39;s running on, instead of a family of processors.(I am not aware if any currently do this.) Generally these days you compile for a minimum feature-set, and any more advanced features go unused. (Or it compiles two or more different versions of the code which are processor specific.)

 Hand-written assembly code will always run faster than any higher-level language code but it also takes the most time to write. While it was the norm to use it for 8-bit and 16-bit machines, it is seldom used today, except for performance critical tasks (video encoding, game console emulation, etc.). Even microcontrollers today are mostly programmed in C.<br>I remember writing a couple of simple Windows programs in 32-bit x86 assembly (using MASM) as a study exercise. What would have taken me less than a couple hours to write in something like Delphi took more than a day to write in MASM. And MASM is a high-level assembler (with support for constructs like IF or WHILE), not pure assembler.<br>Fun fact is that even x86 assembly itself is not true machine code. It is converted to RISC-like micro-ops (the true machine language of the CPU) by the CPU before execution.

 The biggest benefit of learning assembly language is the fact that you will understand how computers actually work. Learning how those opcodes are translated to machine code can help you understand what acutal bits of the instruction mean. Those bits are not random, each one directly controls some part of CPU that affect the outcome. It is very valuable to learn it.

 This brings back memories not so much of programming for my old VIC-20, but doing VGA graphics routines targeted to the then new 386 computers.  I mostly used C, but for performance critical tasks I would use assembly, and since I was stuck with older development tools I ended up inserting 32-bit versions of some instructions by hand as opcodes for critical memory transfers and such to squeeze out just that tiny bit extra to ensure I could still scroll smoothly on less optimal setups.  That was the joy of a single user, single application DOS environment - you can just use blocks of working memory at fixed physical addresses if you really need to.  Fun, but debugging was sometimes a nightmare and explaining what some of the code did was even worse.<br><br>These days I think even the computer&#39;s system BIOS is written in compiled C++.

 C# is actually more or less a Microsoft clone of Java, and technology-wise they are still incredibly similar. They both use a virtual machine. That being said, I don&#39;t really consider the &quot;interpreted&quot; vs. &quot;compiled&quot; distinction to be very relevant anyway. Pretty much no language these days uses an &quot;interpreter&quot; anymore, at least not in the sense of how BASIC interpreters functioned in the 80s. The virtual machine model is pretty much universal for any language that doesn&#39;t compile to machine code.

 Nice general introduction video, but regarding the (lack of) speed of C64 basic, you&#39;re ignoring another big elephant in the room, floating point math.<br><br>When you have a line of code: POKE 1024+X, X - it needs to do two float to integer conversions (and read the string 1024 and do floating point add). And THAT is slow with a 8bit CPU without any hardware floating point support.<br><br>Yes, C64 Basic DOES support integers too, defined like X% instead of &quot;just X&quot;. But using them just makes the code even slower, as it will end up converting them from integer to float before passing to e.g. POKE command (which will then internally convert them back).<br><br>Yes. C64 basic is THAT bad.<br><br>As for difficulty in learning assembly language programming due to having to learn how to access gfx chip etc. - well, you need to do the EXACT same thing with Commodore Basic too! In my opinion, this part is actually even harder, due to not being able to specify numbers as hexadecimal (or binary, as allowed by many assemblers) - and this makes especially bit masking (which you need to do a lot) MUCH harder.<br><br>If you want to make basic code faster, there are few things you can do. Assign ALL commonly used constant numbers to variables (1024 in the example), and put as much code as possible on single lines. Try to make for...next loops happen on a single line.

Then, I began coding on a TRS-80 Color Computer. What a pleasure. While externally an 8-bit processor, instead of 16-bit wide registers, it had internal 32 bit registers. (2x8 and 4x8 respectively). This allowed much more efficient and faster programs, since it could deal with numbers over 4 million, directly.

 Okay so just to clear something up from my understanding. Are machine code and machine language different things? In my rudimentary computer science education I was taught machine code is all binary, that is, it&#39;s the instructions for all the high and low inputs in the corresponding components and that if you converted that to hex it would cease being machine code. In the video &#39;machine language&#39; seems to have been described carefully up until this point especially when illustrating the difference between, but then is used interchangeably. Sorry if I am overthinking this, but I&#39;m just making sure there isn&#39;t a conceptual abstraction between machine code as I understand it and assembly languages. 

 	Replies: ['Bill R', '\u200b@FinalStarmanDX Good luck. I don&#39;t know where I would start if I were to start today to catch up on all this. There are lots of emulators out there - pure software online ones such as Altair ones for example. Or hardware kits of same computer or where Raspberry Pi emulates PDP-11, etc. My biggest gap is I never did enough TTL / breadboard or analog circuit stuff so I really felt the loss when I talked to engineers needing some embedded micro controller. I stuck to the software side of things. Maybe in one lifetime there is only enough time to do one thing well or the other but not both. What with a real job getting in the way! :)', 'FinalStarmanDX', '@Bill R intriguing. Fair enough. I&#39;ve been wanting to get ahold of or build something more in the very early micro/Altair realm just because I didn&#39;t have the benefit of being interested in comp sci as a kid and by the time I was finishing my maths/science education the computing we were doing was far beyond the scope of the DOS I had as a kid and while I learned how to build calculators from TTL chips for instrumentation I figured going back to something 8- bit would help me get a better 1:1 understanding of what my code is doing at the super low level since I have such a gap between building the most basic computer and being trained on CUDA and other heavily parallelized platforms.', 'Bill R', '@FinalStarmanDX Let me muddy the water again by overexplaining.<br><br>You mentioned &quot;... if you converted that to hex it would cease being machine code.&quot;<br>I started my computer science learning playing with the front panel of a mini computer in high school in 1971. There was a row of 16 lighted switches along the top. This was used to display the contents of a register or change it. The switches were grouped in threes so octal notation was natural in how one would remember patterns and write them down. It could have easily been grouped into fours and used hexadecimal. Grouping bits together for the purpose of more compact notation does not stop the machine from doing machine code. I think you understand this :)<br><br>If someone made an accompanying LED display that showed four hex digits instead of 16 light bulbs in a row that would be entirely equivalent.<br><br>At the chip level, from the point of view of the processor, one could say the bit patterns (voltage levels on a group of pins) are a code. Likely some lookup table in the form of gates that eventually triggers data movement between registers. I think calling that a language is streching it. Although it might fit the definition of &#39;language&#39;.<br><br>The bit patterns expressed as &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; characters, or hex, or octal when written down on paper is the human readable equivalent. A short form especially hex which saves the most characters as each digit represents 4 bits. In octal each digit spans 3 bits.<br><br>Assembly language or notation (one could say) goes one step further. Instead of leaving the data as a pile of numbers in whatever base you prefer it allows you to use words, abbreviations, short descriptive verbs such as MOV, LD, ADD. And you can use labels as targets or entry points for a JMP instruction. e.g. JMP TOP_OF_LOOP. Are we still talking machine code/language at this point? Probably.', 'FinalStarmanDX', '@Bill R Ah, thanks for clearing that up. I just wanted to make sure because my exposure to actual comp sci theory is math languages and translation at best.', 'Bill R', 'Yes I think David transmuted the two accidentally a few times. You are right in machine code being strictly the binary states - the bits in a register or memory location that get interpreted as an instruction. Assembly language is the notation: mnemonics (short words, abbreviations) to represent those same instructions in a textural form. The source code is in a simple text file. That&#39;s why it is often said that assembly language has a one-to-one correspondence with machine language/code. But not really. In an assembly language one also has mnemonics to allocate blocks of memory with fixed contents, or fill with numbers, or text which reside at some specified address. Replicate blocks of code. Switch in and out sections of code via some variable value. These are all handy shortcuts. Also target addresses for jumps are written as human-readable words which are hopefully somewhat descriptive. Whereas in pure machine code all you have are specific numeric addresses. Again that&#39;s the function of the assembler to convert mnemonics, labels, numbers to the machine&#39;s native physical addresses. Or... more accurately, the linker will do that (in case people come here and argue those minutia).']

 Okay, let me be that guy, because you can still keep it simple but be a bit more accurate.<br><br>BASIC, depending on the implementation, would be interpreted &quot;on the fly&quot; and that would be running Machine Language (ML) code.  Back in the day, this was the go-to way of running BASIC code.<br><br>Current-day Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are compiled into &quot;p-Code&quot; and then run in interpreter.  Like Blaze, it&#39;s faster.

 I always think it should be refereed to as &#39;machine code&#39;, rather than &#39;machine language&#39;.

 Quick tip for those interested in writing an assembler for their favourite CPU. Write the assembler in JavaScript and run it in a browser, and JavaScript provides a one-line solution to the problem of building a symbol table, that completely avoids your needing to create a hashing algorithm. It also makes life easier when working with opcodes at the binary level, if you apply a little lateral thinking, which is particularly of interest if you&#39;re thinking of writing a Z80 assembler. This is because the low 3 bits of the relevant nibble provide your address mode information for many opcodes, and if you take advantage of this, your Z80 assembler ends up being compact in terms of memory usage as well.<br><br>Once you have your assembler working in JavaScript on your browser, then the next step is to use it to write another version of your assembler, in the machine language of your target retro computer,  and get your assembler working on the actual native platform. Though this is a task for the dedicated or the masochistic, especially if your retro computer only has access to cassette storage instead of floppy disc.<br><br>Back in the days before JavaScript existed, I wrote a Z80 assembler for the Amstrad CPC464 (with add on floppy drive) using Amstrad Basic, then used that assembler to write a native code version of the assembler. Just one problem: the Basic version took 16 hours to process the source code and produce an executable to test, once the project was nearing completion. By comparison, a good implementation of the assembler in JavaScript running on a modern laptop will process the same source code in under a minute, which will <b>massively</b> ease your debugging if you&#39;re the sort that thinks of this task as a challenge to be met head on. :)<br><br>Needless to say, with a 16 hour turnaround for generating the executable, my Amstrad project back in 1990 was an exquisite exercise in self-torture, until it produced the final working executable. From that point on, assembly language programming became a LOT less tedious, with a native code executable processing my source code in under 2 minutes even on a big project, instead of 16 hours!<br><br>However, a little word of warning for those who are thinking &quot;I&#39;d REALLY love an assembler for my Intel PC&quot;. The modern Intel instruction set is a <b>colossus</b> . The user manual for modern Intel CPUs comes in four volumes in print, and my PDF version runs to 4,000 pages. Oh yes, there&#39;s complete documentation of the full CPU instruction set therein, but it&#39;ll take you two years simply to learn what instructions <b>exist</b> on Intel CPUs, before you start your grand assembler project. Then once you launch said project, that&#39;s a three year undertaking if done properly.<br><br>This is the reason that actual commercial assemblers for Intel CPUs are continuous, evolutionary upgrades of assemblers for the previous incarnations of the CPU (8086 -&gt; 80286 -&gt; 80386 -&gt; 80486 etc) , rather than &quot;start from scratch&quot; mega-projects involving the sort of coding effort usually associated with the avionics for a military jet.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of Intel CPUs, Intel routinely deny that they ever made an 80186 as a general purpose CPU, instead claiming that they marketed it as an upscale microcontroller. Except that I&#39;ve seen one of these chips first hand, as has anyone in the UK who got their hands on a first generation Research Machines Nimbus (later generations were 286 or 386 powered). The RM Nimbus was an expensive computer made for the educational market in the UK, and first generation machines weren&#39;t PC compatible because they not only featured the 186, but used some of the extra instructions thereof in the OS. But it was powerful enough to run the dreaded Windows 3.0, though only in real mode, as protected mode only emerged with the advent of the 286.<br><br>By the way, the various books from the 1980s that were written by Rodnay Zaks (yes, &quot;Rodnay&quot; with an &quot;a&quot;) on various 8-bit CPUs are your &quot;go to&quot; reference for the 6502, Z80 and 6809 (the latter for Dragon/Tandy Color Computer buffs). A bit terse in places, but <b>densely</b> packed with useful information. Excellent manuals for the 68000 are also available for those who want to write their own Atari ST/Amiga assembler (some of these are now online for free if you know where to look), though documentation for the operating systems for these two machines is somewhat harder to come by. GEM on the ST in particular will set you off on an entertaining hunt for docs. :)<br><br>So, if you want to find out more about machine language, write your assembler in JavaScript and run it on a bog standard web page in Firefox/Chrome, use it to write a native version for your retro computer of choice, then watch all sorts of wonders become available. But be prepared to treat this as a <b>long term</b> project. This will consume two years of your life with ease, but you&#39;ll be glad you exerted the effort at the end. :)

 C# and Java use byte code with a Just-in-Time compile - in many ways this is similar to an interpreter,. In some ways it&#39;s like your Blitz example, but splits certain things to minimize the interpreted part compared to the data part. The commands are assigned code that can rapidly convert to ML and the data is already converted for the most part. Python executes in a similar fashion. C# uses the Common Language Runtime (CLR) environment. Java uses the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is included with the Java Development Kit (JDK). Yes, I&#39;m over-simplifying it a little here.  All of this is mentioned.<br><br>However, the interpreter on older BASIC was at the time of entry more than at the time of execution. It&#39;s runtime environment was usually slower as a result of keeping track of the symbols used within the program as they were declared and memory must be allocated haphazardly, whereas a byte code compiles the symbol table and allocates space where possible and memory can be managed better.<br><br>C++/C<br>Pascal<br>COBOL<br>FORTRAN<br>Assembler/Macro Assembler<br><br>The above are compiled to ML on given platforms, though it&#39;s worth mentioning that they can cross compile in a few instances.

 A couple of expansions on minor notes:<br><br>Hex numbers being represented as 0xNNNN:  The advantage is that the same format is used to indicate any base.  The other common bases used in programming (besides 10 and 16) are 2 (binary) and 8 (octal).  Octal is mostly a legacy thing that got inherited from the once very popular PDP-11 minicomputers that mostly disappeared about 40 years ago, but comes up all the time in languages like C which have features that expect octal numbers for some things.<br><br>The main reason the C language is used for things like the LINUX kernel is that C was explicitly created for writing operating systems.  It was also written for the specific purpose of writing an OS to play games on, but that&#39;s a separate matter, which also relates to why UNIX uses 9 bits to store basic file permissions.  (For those who&#39;ve never programmed in it, C is an utter minefield.  It&#39;s full of extremely powerful features which will, if you mishandle them, cause your code to explode in a multitude of strange and wonderful ways.  These features are absolutely essential in writing operating systems, but are tricky to use correctly and dangerous if you don&#39;t use them properly.  Things have been much better since a proper standard definition for C came out in 1985, but there is still much truth in the saying, &quot;Everything is legal in C until runtime.&quot;)

 C# and Java are actually both more or less the same being JIT languages. Neither is compiled to machine code ahead of time typically. This is confusing because Visual Studio will give you a .exe file, but this file is not actually machine code - it depends on the operating system having the .NET Runtime.<br><br>They are also not the same as interpreted languages either because machine code does actually get produced on demand, whereas interpreted languages use an interpreter to that runs fixed routines based on code in some other language or bytecode.

 Technically, any of the .Net languages (C#, and possibly C++ in the Microsoft context) and Java are a special cases. They are compiled into a kind of machine code, which is then interpreted (although modern interpreters for these systems compile this intermediate machine code into native machine code as they go - just in time, or JIT compilation. Sometimes called just too late compilation). Although binary (or native machine code) compiler do exist too.. I see why you left it out. It&#39;s weird and complex.

 A small correction, interpreters do not convert to machine language, they themselves are machine language programs that call functions depending on the instructions, if there is direct conversion during execution that is called a Just-in-Time Compiler or a JIT.

 Assembler is very much alive but not in regular PC development. It is used pretty heavily in embedded development where you are coding a small gadget to run on specific microcontroller. In there you actually might use a C as a programming language but very often you need to re-check what compiler generates and you do it in assembly. Specially when you are heavily flash or RAM constrained. You need to fit ever increasing list of features into the cheapest controller possible so now you need to start optimizing. Meaning that you need less assembly code for the same functionality. Believe or not, it often means writing LONGER C program, so that compiler understands you better and can perhaps use more optimized instructions and make the machine code that more compact. So in embedded development longer code may run faster or take less space in memory.<br><br>I have worked in automotive industry and had a project where I had a strict time window to execute my closed loop controller (acquiring and analyzing feedback, calculating a new values and store them in registers for the next cycle). In there I had around 200 clock cycles of hard window. For maintenance, the program was written in C but I made sure that the generated assembly actually did fit into that 200 instructions (actually less as some instructions took multiple cycles) as I had to ensure the calculation finished before the time ran out. So it was quite tricky to give hints to the compiler to use special instructions while still keep the code in C. In such a case even an if-statement might be too expensive and instead you need to base your logic on min/max elimination which do not introduce branching and rans that much faster.<br><br>Also many 8-bit microcontrollers (like STM8AF I was working on) are very similar to 6502 and these controllers are all around us in all sorts of appliances. So learning 6502 assembly is beneficial if you at some point end up in embedded coding on a modern 8-bit controller.

 Also, C# isn&#39;t a directly compiled and then native executed language like C/C++, it is first translated into another in between language, and then this in between langue is executed on a virtual machine and said to be compiled just in time, while executing. So there is definitly a perf loss. And shouldn&#39;t be put on the same level as C/C++.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=10m42s">10:42</a> The reason this happens is because the compiler/interpreter you&#39;re using is compiling/interpreting it into the machine language of the target processor. So even though (for example) you downloaded the same version of Python on your desktop and your, say, raspberry pi, the actual python interpreter differs.

 I learned Assembly on the Apple IIGS and still use the same machine to make up passion projects today.  I mostly do pixel artwork anymore using the 16 colors from the 16 Palettes method.  I&#39;ve done my share of 3200 color images, but those are pretty much just conversions using the palette swapping tricks with interrupts.  It&#39;s fun when doing demo style programs, but using the 16x16 palette method for &quot;256 colors&quot; is a lot more enjoyable.  It&#39;s realistic to create your own work from scratch, making it kind of like a puzzle shifting around colors to make it all work out.  One of my projects in the &#39;90s growing up was a 16x16 pixel art program.  My GS had an accelerator installed, so Deluxe Paint II worked fine, but the challenge of making my own was fun.  I got mine long after they left the market/16-bit was basically dead, but it was a good learning experience.

 A question I hear especially on projects where more junior developers come on is &quot;well why can&#39;t we program X CPU in C then?&quot; C is a high level language and generally portable to all architectures, however processors such as the 6502 and Z80 are still widely used in many places. Why don&#39;t we generally use C on them?<br><br>The answer is that we can, but we don&#39;t. C, as barebones as it seems in day to day usage, still makes assumptions about your hardware. It assumes there&#39;s an easy and performant way to transfer parameters. On the Z80 that&#39;s somewhat possible given its set of registers, but that&#39;s not an option on the 6502. Compilers like cc65 use the stack to do this, but in doing so incurs not only performance penalties, but begins to severely limit how much code you can have in a given context. You begin to strip away parts of C that don&#39;t work well, even string handling (which is quite expensive in its own right). Older systems and lots of embedded systems of today place a lot of emphasis on non-CPU components doing almost as much heavy lifting as the CPU. So when you integrate the peripheral pieces, as well as shave down C to its most barest of bones, you realize that it may have been better to just start with Assembly. In those specific cases, C tends to be the wrong tool for the job.

 I would imagine the biggest bottleneck in the BASIC interpreter is the parser itself‚Äîhaving to constantly read all those strings of ASCII text and try to make sense out of them. After that, a program that consists solely of PEEK and POKE statements would convert 1:1 to machine code, so think about how much time is being wasted just reading and converting them! Also food for thought: the 6502 is a one megahertz processor. That means one million clock cycles every second. Even with each instruction taking anywhere from 2 to 7 clock cycles, that&#39;s still a lot it can do in less time than it takes for the TV to draw a single frame of video.

 Another neat thing that P-code does is to rearrange actions that take values by pushing the values first and then calling the BASIC function, so it acts much more like a proper function call.

Of course I do still love tinkering with and fixing things at a hardware level on most older electronics, but I&#39;ll definitely stay far away from the programming side of things, I&#39;ll leave that to the folks who enjoy it.

 I guess assembly programming is a lost art. But it can really go either way with the Gameboy, since assembly is largely favored over using GBDK, and especially since you can get a brand new Gameboy, the GB Boy Colour, for cheap! (And also because of very accurate emulators.)

 What was that comment about no one programmed in ML after 1980? Let me tell you that as one of the first First Star Software Programmers for Commodore Vic20 and later Commodore Systems in general, assemblers and ML Monitors did not exist until 1983/84. And high end assemblers until at least 1986. Sure such tools existed for the Apple II and Atari since 1980 but Commodore was lacking in these tools back then. Games like Peanut Butter Panic was literally written on paper in assembly and compiled by hand and poked into memory in BASIC and then saved. Later on we learned to write on a monitor on a PET and then transferred to the Vic20 or C64.<br><br>BASIC compliers like French Silk and HesMon helped a lot but we were still using fur skins and stone knives to program games in ML. It is not until after 1986 did things improved for us Commodore Programmers.

 Anyone who wrote in C when I learned it knew exactly how it would be translated to x86 assembly, that&#39;s why you could just insert inline assembly into C routines, same with PASCAL although I never used it. it&#39;s slightly disingenuous to make out C was that far removed from assembly in those days. I no longer write low level code (totally different job now) but was told that because of the complexity of modern x86 CPU&#39;s there is no advantage in speed terms anyway as you need a compiler to order the instructions for maximum efficiency. You might end up actually making slower code in assembly than compiled from C++. Also after spending the video explaining the difference between assembly and machine code you state that to program 70&#39;s 80&#39;s machines you need to know &quot;machine language&quot;, which is wrong, as it&#39;s assembly you need to know. <br><br>Yeah, I got a bit of a feeling of nerd flex about this video about writing in assembly, impressing the kids who never had to use it, but anyone who writes code now could be taught assembly amazingly quickly. The hard bit is learning the low level details of a machine, which is why we invented compilers to abstract away from that.

 Interesting overview, but highly inaccurate. The &quot;before you rush to the comments&quot; quip doesn&#39;t really excuse being wrong; why not say the right thing instead? Something like &quot;All languages start as text and need to eventually run native instructions; some like Java or C# are compiled by a first program into an intermediate representation for portability across multiple architectures and require a second program to execute, some are interpreted like Python and some like C++ are compiled into architecture-specific binaries that aren&#39;t portable&quot;. There, that didn&#39;t really make it more difficult to understand and it&#39;s at least true.<br>It&#39;s pretty remarkable to have listed 10 languages and the information is wrong for at least 4 of them:<br>1. Java is not interpreted, but generally uses a JIT compiler that emits machine code which is then executed. Yes yes the JVM has an interpreted mode but this is somewhat of a detail and not the general mode of execution.<br>2. Same thing with C# mentioned as compiled into machine code when it also uses a JIT (or AOT).<br>3. Ruby has had a JIT for ages.<br>4. Assembly language is not run through a compiler, but an assembler. You can for example take a C program, use a compiler to emit assembly language, and then an assembler and a linker to generate a binary.

 there still is a space for assembler in modern computing. <br><br>if you take a look at something like x264 or ffmpeg. theres large segments of the code dedicated to writing  x86 and ARM assembler to make best use of those platforms for cpu based encoding. Compilers are better now than they used to be sure. but humans are better. and if there is some part of your program that needs to run hundreds or thousand of times per run. it can sometime be worth it to inline assembly that specfic part to make better use of specific SIMD instructions.<br><br>i know x264 under the umbrella of vlc used google code-in to have highschool students write assembly versions of many of the functions that didnt have one at the time.

 Sorry, I&#39;m still going to correct you.<br>BASIC and Python are typically interpreted (although I believe compilers now exist for both)<br>C++ and Pascal are compiled into machine language to produce native executable.<br>Perl programs are stored in text form, but perl normally compiles the code when it is executed (although this is complicated and there are exceptions)<br>C# and Java are compiled into an intermediate P-code like &quot;Blitz BASIC&quot;, then normally are recompiled into machine-code upon execution (or in case of C# optionally upon installation). Yes, C# produces EXEs and DLLs, but they are simply containers for intermediate binaries.<br>Perl, Java and C# binaries may be cached on disk.<br>Assembly language is assembled in to machine language. Although this can be seen similar to compilation - and modern assemblers may be quite complex - it is designed to represent machine language as closely as possible.<br>I&#39;m not very sure about Ruby or Cobol.<br>All of the above except Assembly require the installation of native libraries to run. Programs in C++ and Pascal can be compiled without ones, but then even printing text onscreen has to be done by manually calling OS functions instead of normal &quot;printf&quot;/&quot;writeln&quot; functions. <br>Definition of &quot;Runtime environments&quot; is fuzzy - aforementioned libraries are technically runtime environment, but are normally not called that. <br>BASIC RTE is typically called just &quot;interpreter&quot;. <br>C# RTE is called &quot;.Net framework&quot; and it&#39;s opensource clone is called &quot;Mono&quot; - those are required to run any normal C# code

 Okay, I&#39;ve seen this mistake being made time and time again: interpreters don&#39;t convert high level languages into machine code. Rather, the interpreter itself is a machine code program that steps through the high level program character by character, and as the name suggests interprets what those characters mean and what action should be performed. All of the machine code needed to perform the high level program is within the interpreter itself. No additional machine code is produced by the interpreter. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called an interpreter rather than an assembler or compiler. In comparison, a high level language like Python is a hybrid system that consists of both a compiler and an interpreter: the compiler takes the source of a Python module and converts it into a &quot;virtual&quot; machine code, which is then interpreted. As a third example, Java is also a compiler and interpreter, but some Java runtimes can also compile a Java method directly into machine code on the fly when needed, and then that is executed directly by the CPU.

 You do great videos I really enjoy them. During my Cybersecurity class we had to learn Architecture which I  thought was unnecessary. But the dean of the program had to give me an example by telling me how CPU&#39;s were vulnerable through their power usage. And that gave me a better insight on why I needed to know Architecture. So the way I see it knowing Machine Language gives you a better leg up in knowing how computers work and how to secure them when you get down into the weeds.

I&#39;ve been there, done that, and got the t-shirt.  It wasn&#39;t fun.  You don&#39;t need another processor with math hardware when all you really need is an 8-bit C compiler.

I learned x86_64 and then later on Arm64. Assembly is still used and far from a dying art. A huge group of people write exploits and proof of concept exploits to sell to software vendors so they can patch them. It&#39;s a bug bounty. Although most bounties are webapp related there are tons that are for closed source programs so we frequently will use radare2 or Ghidra or ida64 or plain old gnu debugger if you are a masochist to reverse engineer the software.<br><br> It&#39;s also used to reverse engineer malware nowadays to find out a way to get a signature on polymorphic or metamorphic malware. Only way to get a signature is to know something it does consistently that is unique to it and the only way to know what it is doing is by watching what it does in a close environment by observing memory and instructions carefully.<br><br> I just got started with arm assembly not too long ago to take up iot hacking for internet connected devices that really shouldn&#39;t be external facing ever. Smart TV&#39;s, cameras, Amazon&#39;s blink security system, even sex toys. A large part of putting together an proof of concept exploit to get a cve created is writing shell code and making it as small and easy to package as possible without using multi-part stagers to deploy your exploit. Which is very important for a smaller network footprint or the possible signatures able to be created from using a stager method for your payload. So fighting for sizes as small as humanly possible while now trying to bypass all the memory protections of today like nx, dep, aslr, etc the craft is still alive and well to make a long story short. <br><br>Hopefully this makes some sense I&#39;m off my face right now on a sleep aid but I saw this comment and some of the replies and got a bit disheartened and sad that many people do not see the amount of work the younger generation is putting in with low level languages. I have immense respect for those before us especially the early devs but just know that legacy of creativity by working in constrained environments is not lost. In some ways its more difficult now than ever before.']

 I&#39;ll tell you something, I spent a whole entire semester learning Assembly Language for the PIC 16F887. Why do you ask? Well, it was actually part of my courses (I&#39;m studying in Computer Engineering). I&#39;ve done C, C++, Python and Arduino and they are definitely not the same. Even though the PIC only has 35 instructions (compared to 56 in the video), I definitely had a few long nights studying! I also had a lab test where I had to alternate a 7-segment display to certain patterns in just under 3 hours. I got it done, but alot of my colleagues suffered from their grade because of it. If you ask my opinion, I have alot of respect for Assembly programmers. I also prefer Assembly over any of those high-level languages.

There are some projects to properly &quot;ahead of time&quot; compile C# into native binaries but it&#39;s still pretty rough.

 I have always wondered how my career would have been different if someone had explained this to me in 7th grade 1983. I was good at basic programming but basic is so limited I started dealing with hardware more than software. And in 2002 did get to give Gates a tour of a 3000 computer data center I had been in charge of building for his non Microsoft company. <br><br>Understanding binary was always my strong suit. We had an old server we needed to put a 350mhz processor in but the motherboard instructions only showed the dip switches up to 200mhz. We had about 10 I mean 1010 technicians looking at the problem and I said ‚Äúwell the dip switches are just counting in binary so continue counting up‚Äù when they all looked at me funny I acknowledged not every one can think in binary. :). <br><br>I didn‚Äôt really understand the concepts in this video until I was in my late 20‚Äôs and I was fully on the hardware path by then.

 I think your videos would benefit from spending more time researching the topics. Your segment comparing languages was quite inaccurate, only to be followed with a generic disclaimer in which you make fun of your audience. The time you spent sourcing that Jim Carrey clip and editing it in could have been spent researching C#/.NET/Java so you could get it right to begin with. And your copy/paste response to everyone raising it saying you didn&#39;t want to spend &quot;2 hours&quot; on a tangent is disingenuous at best.

 Assembly and machine language are still very much used today on modern computers. Optimizers can go a long way, but sometimes it&#39;s required to write specialized code in assembly. One example is in cryptography. A memset() can be optimized out by the compiler, causing the private key to persist in memory, or it might cause different code paths to take different amount of time, allowing for side-channel attacks. In such cases, assembly is the way to go.

 I really wish assembly languages and machine code were more prominent in development courses and programs today. You may never need to write assembly, and unless you&#39;re into retro coding or microcontroller programming you&#39;re probably never going to write an entire application in assembly, but it definitely helps you understand computing at a fundamental level; each individual machine instruction is pretty easy to understand on its own, and all of the complexity and power we have is simply through chaining a bunch of these instructions together. I&#39;ve definitely used assembly in my Arduino projects to get performance gains as well as tighter timing and more predictable behavior, and assembly still has the potential to speed up intense processing applications. In some ways, if we still used assembler in places where it makes sense to, our computers would feel even more powerful than they are today. (If you consider what C64 accomplished on 1MHz, and then simultaneously feel that your 3GHz machine is laggy and slow, you&#39;ll get what I mean!)

 Great video Dave! Takes me back to my youth (also C64) and I also Used blitz to compile some simple basic programs I had written. I also had an MSX on which I wrote a complete graphic sketching program, in BASIC, but unfortunately the keystroke registration routine became so slow it was unusable. Fortunately a friend of mine was savvy in coding, and wrote an assembly routine in Z80 assembly that I could execute instead of running the tedious BASIC subroutine. It would return the same values so it was plug and play, and my sketching program was actually usable. I made a pretty good sketch of the Ghostbusters logo, and could even save it. But it would save the sketch command order as I recorded every command into a database. The next time I would load the sketch it would redraw it exactly as I had drawn it. It was pretty cool, and just about the pinnacle of my programming skills. Today I am trying to learn python but my age is showing and I am having a much harder time understanding it, despite it&#39;s partial similarities with basic.<br>Again, great (first?) video from your new studio.

 At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=9m34s">9:34</a> - The CPX #$00 is completely unnecessary. INX already sets the Z flag if the INX results in X=0. That‚Äôs 2 cycles * 256 loops of wasted raster time.<br><br>Saving 512 cycles may not sound like much, but consider that each scan line of pixels is 63 cycles... 512 cycles is 8 rows of pixels; an entire row of characters.<br>Obviously this program doesn‚Äôt matter but in a game, that‚Äôs a huge savings.

 I don&#39;t quite understand why you included Java and C# in your language explanation, separated them into two categories, and then added a disclaimer telling that you know it&#39;s wrong? Just mention that some languages, like Java and C# use a combination of compiling and interpretation. It&#39;ll even underline more that machine code is achieved at some point, even if not at compile time.

 Programmers today are the worse for not knowing how the metal works.  Having an intimate knowledge of how the CPU actually executes instructions, and how that relates to the other hardware inside the machine is special.  It means if you are clever, you can extract the absolute best performance you can out of whatever resources you have.<br><br>But modern programming is so divorced from the hardware, that it is not useful anymore.  Which is a double edged sword.  Yes, the code is very portable, which is desirable, but it is wasteful in machine cycles, which is not.  Especially when you consider the cost of running that code millions of times a day, and that costs computer time, and energy.

 INX will set the zero flag when appropriate, so that CPX instruction is not necessary. 

 	Replies: ['The Guy That Everyone Ignores', '@Not2Tired Gaming The CPX #$00 instruction is unnecessary because whenever a register is incremented, decremented, or loaded on the 6502, the status flags are set as if the register was just compared to zero.

But I&#39;m new to 6502 assembly, and asking a question rather than asserting a possibly better answer.  I&#39;m sorry if I made it seem otherwise, I can see how it may have came off that way.  What I was imagining was a scenario where the other code had the X register with the desired value before branching back (that is, incrementing X would be undesirable).  If the X register can be incremented without trouble, then yes, putting CPX outside of the main loop would definitely be better.', 'Guy Perfect', '@Not2Tired Gaming Then it can have its own CPX and branch to $1302 instead.

 Fun times....The &quot;real world&quot; job I had was writing Cobol and RPG II/III on system/36&#39;s and As/400 (Midsized business computer).  As I got more experience, we would often compile the RPG III, and print out the MI code (machine interface = ML/Assm), and would optimize our programs by seeing how the compiler would do the translations.  After getting use to it, I even wrote a few programs directly in MI, because it could do things the higher level languages couldn&#39;t do. (ex:  it had encryption and compression commands built in).  Then I switched to the .Net universe, and did some of the same things.  Looking at the IL created by a compiler to try to improve performance.  But by then, I was working with huge databases, and transactional load, and fine tuning the SQL, and how many virtual machines were running was more important.   Amazing how much things have changed from my first basic program on a dial up tele-type (70&#39;s) to today!  :-)

 Bit of a misnomer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=5m26s">5:26</a>. Assembly is machine language, just extrapolated into something readable to humans. When I took my uni course on assembly, more or less the last thing we did was write pure binary code.

Higher level compiled languages are a bit more disconnected from machine language when compared to assembly

My point was more just that, at least in the assembly language I learned, it was 1 to 1 with machine code, only difference was instead of binary or hex to represent commands, we used letters and decimals. I think his music to score comparison is more describing using a more complex assembler similar to what stuff like C would use.

 Without a memory map of the hardware, you end up having to reverse engineer the board to determine out what addresses control which hardware (through address decoders to chip select or enable inputs).

 In the very early days of the home computer boom in the UK (so 1980 to about 1982), if a piece of software was written in machine code (we didn&#39;t really call it &quot;machine language&quot;), it would be a definite selling point that would be mentioned prominently in the advertising.<br><br>That&#39;s because so many bedroom coders had popped up selling software, and much of it was written in BASIC and was of poor quality.

 At my school they had a really, <i>really</i> old computer. It had a grand total of 4KiB of core memory (Google it) and three tape drives. It had no ICs at all; the whole thing was made out of discrete transistors on a myriad of circuit boards, filled an entire room, and had a cooling system like a jet engine. It had no screen, or even a teletype: it had a &#39;front panel&#39; with a hexadecimal numeric pad and a few other buttons. To start running anything you had to manually key in a bootloader in hex. The bootloader was just enough code to load in an actual program from a tape and jump to it. On this kind of computer, all programs were written in hex, they didn&#39;t even have assembly. The whole program, plus its working data, had to be squeezed into that 4KiB. Oh yeah, those were the days!

IIRC C# is too.<br><br>It&#39;s also probably worth talking about how interpreters work.  Some just step through the program; others generate snippets of machine language on the fly.

 I also think of &quot;machine language&quot; and &quot;Assembler&quot; as the same thing.   The difference is that &quot;machine language&quot; is just a bunch of numbers, while assembler is the same code presented mnemonicly, in a form that humans can understand.  There is a 1:1 relationship between each assembler mnemonic and a machine code instruction.  The thing that you didn&#39;t express is that while the 6502 has 56 different instruction, each one of those instruction has several different forms, and each variant has its own unique op-code.  The difference between these forms being the &quot;addressing mode&quot;, IE: the way the processor finds the location of the data it will be using in that instruction.  So, when learning 6502 machine language you need to understand what each instruction does, and what each different addressing mode does.  Also not all addressing modes are available for each instruction.<br><br>Hope to see the new studio all fleshed out real soon,  Please take us on a tour of the entire building, not just the &quot;sound/video&quot; stage.

 Back in the 90&#39;s I&#39;ve created an app that would display text on the screen. The first version was written in the Turbo Pascal. I didn&#39;t like the result, so I&#39;ve bought the Turbo Assembler Bible and converted every single function into a more optimized version (fun fact: turbo pascal had very, very, slow loops, because of all the boundary check subroutines). So, when I&#39;ve finished the conversion, I&#39;ve ended up with the app that could fill up the screen with random letters, with the random color, at the random positions in the time it took the screen to switch from the text mode to the SVGA mode. The regular pascal program was far, far, behind. <br><br>The bottom line is:<br>1. Every language will convert your program to the machine language, but some of them will do a crappy job. <br>2. You should always try to find and fix the slower parts of your code. One optimal line can make a very huge impact on the whole program.

 yeah, java is weird. Java runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which means that it is actually still compiled, but for the JVM, not x86/64, ARM, RISC-V, or any other instruction sets. The JVM then runs that compiled bytecode on top of the chip, making it a virtualize language. This means that depending on who you ask, it can be compiled, interpreted, or what I think of it as, both at the same time.

 I remember when I had my C64, when I was a young teen,  I learned BASIC inside and out.  But I couldn&#39;t ever figure out how to make those complex games that you bought in the store.  So I double checked the C64 manual and saw the chapter about &quot;Machine Language&quot;.   It was a little unclear, and I just couldn&#39;t get anything I put in to work.  THEN, I noticed something that I overlooked.  There was ONE tiny, throw away line in that manual that said that I needed something called C64Mon to make this stuff work.   I hunted all over for that damn program.  No one sold it.   Everyone looked at me like I had two heads when I asked if I could order it.   No store, or anyone out there who I could find, seemed to know of this program&#39;s existence.  To this day, I&#39;ve never seen it.   Then, even more frustrating, when I learned about something called, &quot;Assembly Language&quot;, I decided to try that.  I hit every book store and software store, and local library,.  There wasn&#39;t a SINGLE DAMN THING that I could find.  And of course, people at these stores had no clue what I was looking for.     Years later, I FINALLY found a program called &quot;Merlin&quot; that was for assembly language.  But then I tried to learn it.  I managed to find some books on C64 Assembly language.  But then ran into MORE road blocks.   The way these books were written, they assumed that I knew what all the internal hardware was, in the machine, and how the stuff worked, right down to the damn circuits.  Like they expected me to be an electrical engineer.   So I needed to learn THAT stuff.. from somewhere.   I was able to find books about that stuff, but THEY all assumed that I understood Machine Language.   The way things were back then, it was completely impossible for a young teenager to just go and learn this stuff.  ALL the literature and books about this stuff all had this circular reasoning that in order to learn the language, you needed to understand the inner workings of the machine, and in order to learn the inner workings of the machine, you needed to learn that language.   Where I lived, it was just impossible to find that information at the public level.  I&#39;m assuming that back then, they only assumed that people learning Assembly or Machine Language were high level computer engineers being taught the stuff by college professors and electronics engineers.  There wasn&#39;t much available, at all, to really learn this stuff.  Everyone I know who learned Assembly or Machine Language, learned if from people they knew, rather than books.  Oh.. even to this day, I&#39;ve never seen this illusive &quot;C64Mon&quot; that the Programmers manual talks about.  It&#39;s not even on the internet.  I&#39;m assuming that it was either never released, or no one used it and it was discontinued quickly.  It&#39;s a lost piece of software.

PC program counter (the only 16 bit register on the 6502), used for branch and jump and updated during execution Accumulator (A):  Where the results of mathematical operations accumulate.  Status Register, containing 8 bits the status register can be thought of as flags that are set based on the results of an operation.  X and Y are used as an index similar to for...next statements.  Stack Pointer:  The Stack is the first page of memory and is used to save return addresses and for very temporary storage.  Zero page (0-255) also useful for certain addressing modes, since it only required one byte it was sometimes used as a speedy alternative.

 Excellent job! In fact, software development has not changed since the days of directly programming hardware interfaces. Today, as then, it‚Äôs not the LANGUAGE one needs to know well, rather it‚Äôs the FRAMEWORK that one needs to master to build anything useful. Assembly is simple. So is C. So is Java. The frameworks are NOT simple.

 I think you&#39;re confusing Java with Javascript here. Java is not interpreted, and C# is not compiled to machine language. Both of them are compiled to an intermediate binary language that is interpreted by a framework to execute it.

 Seems like assembler programming is now pretty much only used in microcontrollers and the very earliest parts of the boot loaders.

 I actually quite enjoy coding in ASM, and have chosen it over C for some projects back in college. Although you can program microcontrollers with compiled C, I think there is still a fair amount of ASM programming for those outside of the hobby-space. So there&#39;s one modern use for assembly.<br><br>As stated with C#, some generalizations were made about these languages. One very interesting one is Java, which in this video was categorized as an interpreted language rather than a compiled language. This is kind of accurate but kind of not. I&#39;d say strictly speaking Java is a compiled language that results in machine code. But realistically speaking it&#39;s an interpreted language. But the reality is it&#39;s generally both.<br><br>Java works by compiling code to binaries that run on a Java processor. Similar to compiling for an x86, ARM, Z80, 6502, etc. processor. Except that Java processors aren&#39;t a real thing. (Well, they are but they&#39;re very rare, and that&#39;s not really the point of Java) Instead, your runtime is actually a virtual machine that converts Java instructions to your native CPU instructions. Which is where it&#39;s similar to interpreted languages. This is what gives it cross-functionality as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can be created to run on multiple architectures while all taking the same Java binary.<br><br>Obviously, explaining that in this video would have been a completely irrelevant tangent, so I think simply grouping it in with interpreted languages makes sense, but it&#39;s definitely unique in how it works, and quite fascinating in my opinion.

 Java and C# need not be interpreted.  Most ARM chips include running compiled Java natively. Also, languages like Python and Ruby are not converted to machine code.  The interpreter is machine code. 

 	Replies: ['steve Zara', '@PikaChu I think the direct Java byte code running is now considered obsolete, as there aren‚Äôt the memory restrictions that made use of bytecode preferable.  Also, Java optimisation for high performance tends to come after byte code generation, so running Java on its own runtime gives much better performance.  I was pointing out that Java isn‚Äôt, by definition, an interpreted language.']

 Everyone in this thread is wrong about Java. There is no &quot;one way&quot; to execute Java byte code. There are at least three ways. A tradition very slow interpreter from the old days, a JIT compiler that caches the results of compilation in machine code to use over and over AND ahead of time compilation of Java code to create stand alone executables. The latter being provided by <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">https://www.graalvm.org/</a>. As the 8-bit guy said &quot;it&#39;s not that simple&quot;.

 One thing I&#39;ve noticed working on my music tracker for the X16 is how small assembly programs can be. I know some of these reasons (such as the fact it&#39;s 8-bit vs 64-bit) but nonetheless, it&#39;s pretty amazing my .PRG file is only 5.1k at the moment, and that&#39;s without doing a lot of space saving optimizations.<br><br>You mentioned assembly is a lost art on modern machines and I actually think, in a way, that&#39;s a shame because it really does give an appreciation for things, and I do think, at least in some cases, code can be much more compact that compiled languages, though this does depend on how good the compiler is. That said, I find I approach assembly programming differently than when writing in C and I think that is part of the other reason.<br><br>Of course, it helps there&#39;s no bloated OS to get in the way when using the X16. On Linux, I couldn&#39;t immediately tell you how to draw something as simple as a lined box on the screen. There&#39;s so many ways to do it. Actually in some ways it&#39;s worse than writing in assembly for one computer because, even though I can use a high level language, there&#39;s just all this stuff to have to mess with. While it took me a bit to figure out the VERA on the X16, it&#39;s pretty easy for me to draw a box on the screen without much fuss at all. I really like the simplicity and we could use more of this in the mdoern era, I think!

Do remember how much of a pain it was when in transitioning code that originated in 16-bit DOS and Windows to 32-bit Windows platform -- in particular making sure that the data structures lined up properly (some of which would need to reflect 32-bit, and others needed to reflect 16-bit to maintain compatibility).', 'Zolt√°n Boros', 'Not to mention dialects of different compilers.', 'Desmond Hawkins', '@Conenion Yes, all true for sure. My point is that very few code bases use them, even modern ones. My copy of K&amp;R is also the 2nd edition and that&#39;s how I first learned C, a language I&#39;ve been using almost daily for over 20 years now. In my experience most software is written for a single platform so it doesn&#39;t matter a whole lot. All I&#39;m saying is that the idea that it&#39;ll run on any CPU is far from reality, especially when referring to the wild variety of architectures that existed decades ago.', 'Conenion', '@Desmond Hawkins <br>That is a strange way of arguing,  considering that inttypes.h/stdint.h were introduced in C99, 10 years before the first Rust release. If a C book or course doesn&#39;t mention it, it is the book&#39;s or course&#39;s fault.<br><br>Kernighan/Richtie were well aware of the pros &amp; cons of having defined bit widths.

A more accurate statement would be: &quot;When you write code in C, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;ll crash on any CPU you haven&#39;t tested it on&quot;.<br>Yes the portability of C was a huge jump from having to literally rewrite everything from scratch for a different instruction set, but this is still a very low-level language where various architectures have significant differences. Whereas modern low-level languages like Rust have chosen to use fixed-width primitive types like i32/i64/u32/u64/etc, it&#39;s trivial to get bitten by changes to the size of int or long on common architectures like x86_64 on your development machine and an ARM-based Raspberry Pi for example. I&#39;ve written my fair share of C code and being truly portable requires a significant amount of work and pretty much means abandoning the original standard types like short/int/long/float/double since you&#39;d also need to add tons of pre-processor conditions to make sure it&#39;s safe. C has equivalents to these Rust types now but you will rarely find them mentioned in a C book or course.']

 One slight correction. Java is somewhat hybrid of interpreted and compiled language. It does require its own runtime environment (Java Runtime Environment, JRE), however the source code has to be converted to binary compiled machine code. The only difference between let&#39;s say C is that the machine code is exclusively designed for JRE, which is run by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Another quirk is that the Java machine code is optimised for object references and calls.

 Great video. I always wanted to be able to write machine code but I couldn&#39;t get my head round it back in the day. The Sinclair machines (ZX81, Spectrum, QL) didn&#39;t make coding in machine code that accessible. Particularly when slow cassette tape loading was the only option available. Load Assembler from cassette, write program in assembly language, save to cassette, assemble code, run code, crash computer. Reset computer, load assembler from cassette, load saved assembly code from cassette, debug code, save debugged file to cassette, assemble code, run code, crash computer, reset computer ... and so on.<br><br>I always envied the Acorn Atom and later Acorn Proton (BBC Micro) which came with an inline assembler in their BASIC interpreter.

The CoCo used a Motorola 6809 microprocessor -- but Bixby says he rewrote his code in Z-80 assembler, so his would&#39;ve most likely been either the original Model I, or one of its successors, the Model III or Model 4.', 'Blahorga Slisk', '@The Guy That Everyone Ignores Only program I ever wrote in machine language was a serial communication program that ran on a single board computer with a 6502, at least I think it was that processor. It had a six seven-segment LED display elements. Four showed the address and two the value of the byte at that address. In the ROM it had a very simple editor that basically allowed you to use a hexadecimal keypad to enter an address and change the stored value if desired, or you could execute code from the current address.<br><br>This was a computer class in school and we started by building the computer. The PROM with the minimal editor was provided pre programmed. When we had our SBC&#39;s up and running we were handed a book that basically just listed the available commands, the byte structure for each and the number of T states it took to execute each command, and were told to write a serial communication program. The final test would be to take any two machines and have them talk to each other. I had some knowledge of coding for the Z80, though I had never written anything from scratch that did anything interesting, but most of the others in the class didn&#39;t have a clue. We were pretty much thrown in at the deep end of the pool...<br><br>I still remember that the protocol was using a start bit, eight data bits, parity and a stop bit, and I think it was running at 1200 or 2400 baud. All to make it as complicated as possible. I was the one who got to specify the protocol and I choose it to make things interesting and to make sure we had a hard start of each byte transfer. The start bit was a 1 and the stop bit was a 0, so there was always a nice edge to sync on for the receiver. People still grumbled over having to calculate the parity bit but I thought it was a good exercise. I don&#39;t remember if there were any other kind of handshake but it&#39;s possible.<br><br>To make things more interesting the SBC didn&#39;t have any kind of UART so the communication was done using the I/O pins and with no real time clock we had to carefully time the signalling to match the desired bitrate. Fortunately the use of start, stop and parity gave you a good structure to sync on so we had pretty large tolerances. With a total of 11 bits for each byte the signal skew has to be pretty awful to be a problem.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember how many bytes my program was, but given the tedious method of entry anything larger than an empty loop felt way to long...<br><br>I think I only entered the program once and that was when the teacher tested them. Fortunately it worked perfectly first time, which wasn&#39;t the case for everyone else in class. I do think most got their programs working eventually.<br><br>Once a few of us had working programs the teacher showed us a cross compiler he had written in Pascal and had running on a CPM machine. He had also added a simple communication program to the PROM for the SBC so it would be connected to the CPM machine to transfer the compiled code.<br><br>Those who still hadn&#39;t managed to get their program working now got to use the cross compiler to speed up the trouble shooting. They still had to time their loops, but no longer had to manually calculate every address and looking up every instruction code, not to mention they didn&#39;t have to enter the program over and over again using the hexadecimal keypad...<br><br>And I wrote another wall of text... Sorry for that.', 'The Guy That Everyone Ignores', '@Blahorga Slisk Before I ever had heard the word &quot;compiler&quot;, I had written a very simple one for the Apple II which could compile BASIC programs that only used the hi-res statements.  All of the coordinates for plotting dots and drawing lines had to be hard-coded.  My compiler simply converted these coordinates, which were stored as character strings in BASIC, to binary, loaded them into registers and called the same routines in ROM that BASIC called for plotting dots and drawing lines.  I tested my compiler on a BASIC program that drew a picture in about 20 seconds.  The compiled program drew the same picture instantaneously.', 'Blahorga Slisk', '@The Guy That Everyone Ignores Interesting that the numbers conversion from a string to binary numbers was such a huge bottleneck. I say that as I remember programming the ABC 80 in basic back in the very early 80&#39;s. It was a Z80 based computer and the version of BASIC that it ran had a lot of strange quirks, one of which was that you could enter the numbers explicitly as string values just by putting them inside quotation marks. So as far as to the output the two following lines were equal:<br><br>Let A=10 : For X = 1 to 500 : Print A+X-6 : Next X\r<br>Let A=&quot;10&quot; : For X = &quot;1&quot; to &quot;500&quot; : Print A+X-&quot;6&quot; : Next X<br><br>There were however differences in how they are stored in memory and how fast they are interpreted. If I remember correctly the editor stored any number that didn&#39;t have a qualifier as a 9 byte floating point value. But by entering the numbers as strings they were also stored as strings. so in the statement Let A=10 the number will take up 9 bytes of memory while if it was written as a string it would only take up four bytes. To make things even more fun the interpreter handled the numbers that were entered as strings in fewer clock cycles. The variables were the same, so for optimal performance you would have used string variables for everything except possibly integer value variables as those were only 16 bits. But if I remember correctly integer variables were still slower when used in calculations than string variables. Always thought this was really weird, but back then there was a lot of that going around in the computer industry.<br><br>Another fun thing was that if you were doing calculations that required high precision then you would convert all numbers to strings and use only string variables in all calculations. Not only was it faster but the results were more exact. While I can see why it could be more exact I still can&#39;t figure out how the heck it could be faster. But I remember verifying this myself.<br><br>Those machines were very limited, but at the same time just so simple to work with. You had no libraries of functions to load and the hardware was no more advanced than that you could easily read the circuit diagram and figure out how it worked. You could actually buy the ABC 80 as a kit with a bare PCB and bags of components and solder everything together yourself if you wanted. The simple architecture also made it so easy to write programs in machine language or assembler for these 8 bit processors. After all you had at the most 64KB of memory to worry about...', 'The Guy That Everyone Ignores', 'I used to write programs in BASIC on an Apple II+ and manually convert them to machine language.  It was typical for them to run 200 to 300 times as fast.  I found most of the speed improvement was from working with binary numbers directly rather than numbers stored as character strings in BASIC.<br><br>Also, I calculated Pi out to over 20,000 decimal places, though the math was done in binary.  It still took five days to run even with everything written in machine language!  There is no doubt it would have taken years to run if I had wrote it in BASIC.']

 When you learn assembly and program in it, you remove all the &#39;magic&#39; from behind the scenes and it gives you a much better understanding of what the machine is doing. It gives you understanding of why doing certain things, even in a higher level language, in certain ways are better or worse. However, compilers these days are also very good and will almost surely do a better job than you ;) In a setting like for work or when you&#39;re working collaboratively, writing code so that the next person who has to look at it to make modifications or fix something can quickly and easily understand it and do the work is better than writing something that is very highly optimized and complex. Later, if there&#39;s a performance problem, run profilers to see where the performance problems lie, and then optimize <b>those</b> areas rather than the areas that you <b>think</b> may be the problem. The problem may be that optimizing a routine that&#39;s called a bunch of times is a better first target than optimizing one routine that is called only once or twice. Profiling is what will tell you where the time is being spent. Plus, we always paraphrased an old saying to indicate this idea: Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

 There is an active effort to prevent assembly language and machine language programming.  Some might call it a conspiracy, and I&#39;m not joking.  I agree with you on people not using assembly much anymore, but it&#39;s wrong to say it&#39;s because there isn&#39;t any benefit.  Literally dealing with decades of obfuscations of little to no value, almost certainly done to keep the C language a standard.  It is practically impossible to use assembly, or even create a compiler, without having C handle the creation of the executable file.  It&#39;s a shame, because it has ended up as a bottleneck preventing new technology.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpi9n2H3kE&amp;t=4m56s">4:56</a> as you say later on, it&#39;s not &quot;black or white&quot; (compiled vs interpreted) and I wanted to give some of my thoughts :<br>- Python : it&#39;s true you need an interpreter to run it, but it&#39;s grammatically too complex to be interpreted line by line (eg: like BASIC) so it&#39;s usually compiled to something intermediate (eg: bytecode that CPU cannot understand, that is why you need an interpreter). So, in a sense, even Python is compiled at some point. <br>- You put Java and C# in separate groups but they actually behave the same way : code is converted to an intermediate language at compile time which is then converted to machine code by the VM at runtime.<br>- in general : being interpreted/compiled is not a property of the language but a property of the implementation. There is nothing that prevent interpreting C code (even if 99% of the time C is compiled to machine code). The other way around, there is also projects like Cython that take Python code, translate it to C code then compile it (so even Python can be compiled to machine code). When we say a language is &quot;compiled/interpreted&quot; we usually speak about the most common implementation.

 Not trying to rain on your parade, I like your videos.  I just find it strange that you categorize C# as compiled to machine code and Java as interpreted -- they are both compiled into a bytecode which is then run by a execution machine.  They are 100% the same category using your classification framework :).  Furthermore, Java/JVM has a super reliable and tested JIT compiler, that compiles the Java Bytecode into machine language for frequently run sections.  That&#39;s why the JVM is called &quot;hotspot&quot;, fwiw.<br><br>Having a C in C# doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s closer to C/C++.  C# and the CLR (Common Language Runtime) is effectively Microsoft&#39;s reimplementation of Java and the JVM.<br><br>It&#39;s definitely outside the scope of this video, but JITs actually allow non-machine language programs to exceed performance of machine language programs in some cases, since the JIT compiler can compile for the runtime instruction sets, rather than a lowest-common-denominator set of older instruction sets.

Meaning, someone out there still has to be an expert in assembly language in order to continue updating and optimizing this and porting it to new platforms.

Typically the model in C reflects what you have on Unix systems using ASCII.  That&#39;s where you notice one problem -- on the PC in DOS and Windows, a &quot;newline&quot; is a carriage-return followed by a linefeed (a convention carried over from CP/M).  Sure, the runtime library virtualize that for you (by &quot;automagically&quot; transforming CR/LF into LF on read and writing CR/LF when you write LF on output) and everything&#39;s fine, right.  Weellll... It&#39;s fine and dandy as long as you&#39;re ONLY dealing with files on the PC in DOS and Windows (that have been read/written with programs using the same model).  If you transfer text files between other systems you run headlong into a problem, or dealing with programs written with a different runtime library, you run into a problem.   You&#39;re apt to find that various implementations are broken in different ways.  Some libraries trigger on the CR and &quot;eat&quot; the following character (assuming that&#39;s it&#39;s going to be the LF).  Others trigger on LF and &quot;eat&quot; the character preceding it (assuming that it&#39;s the CR).  Still others simply transform CR <b>and</b> LF as LF on read.  Each of these result in different behaviors.<br>It&#39;s hard to understand why Pascal uses EOLN() rather than looking at the character code -- until you&#39;ve dealt with some Control Data mainframes.  IIRC the line termination sequence for text files was something like a word-aligned sequence of consecutive zero-bytes.  On the Cyber 750 system the words are 60 bits in length -- divided into 10 6-bit bytes.  And it doesn&#39;t use ASCII code.<br>Ah yes... let&#39;s not forget the &quot;fun&quot; in dealing with transferring textual data between different systems.  For me, that was transferring C source files from the Unix systems and the IBM mainframes, going through the UUCP to BITNET gateways.  Depending on the particular gateway, slightly different translation tables existed (for the slightly different versions of EBCDIC).  Character codes that often got &quot;mangled&quot; included horizontal tabs (sometimes they translated to tabs, sometimes expanded to spaces -- though the translation wasn&#39;t consistent -- sometimes tab character was always translated a fixed sequence such as 8 spaces, sometimes it was &quot;intelligent&quot; and inserted enough spaces to advance to the next column of 8 characters, and occasionally those &quot;expansions&quot; were buggy and occasionally a tab turned into nothing), curly-braces (sometimes they came through OK, sometimes they would disappear completely, other times they turn into something else), caret (sometimes it comes through OK, sometimes not) and backslash.   The loss of curly-braces meant that you&#39;d have to figure out how to restore them.  You might think that indentation will help you there -- until you realized that you&#39;d tabs for that (and the tab character mangling messed up the indentation).  The &quot;solution&quot; (i.e. workaround) for me was to use trigraphs.  Indeed the code ended up looking fugly, and got fuglier each time the character code translation took place, but at least the underlying logic came through.   Pascal code would get mangled by the same buggy character code translation -- similarly the workaround for me was to translate stuff like square brackets, curly braces and caret into the alternate sequences that Pascal/VS on the IBM would allow ( &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; could be substituted with &quot;(.&quot; and &quot;.)&quot; , &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; would be changed to &quot;(*&quot; and &quot;*)&quot;, and &quot;^&quot; to &quot;-&gt;&quot;) when sending to the IBM, and performing reverse transform when going the other way around.']

 I recently played with an emulator for the Sinclair ZX81, and wanted to make it play Nim. Only problem was that the BASIC had no command for bitwise XOR, leading to a truly disgusting bodge involving turning each number into a string of the binary representation, and then iterating over the two strings and performing comparisons. It took about 40 seconds to make a move, and maybe 100 lines of BASIC got replaced with 8 bytes of machine code once I worked out how to poke into RAM and run machine code

 Great explanation, David! Since that kind of stuff is my daily work, I didn&#39;t really learn anything new (except for some details about the 6502, which is a processor I never worked with -  my parents didn&#39;t want to buy me a C64 when they were a thing). I wouldn&#39;t say that programming in assembly language is totally obsolete today. It may be in a PC environment for the reason that you mentioned, but I have used it quite a lot on 8-bit microcontrollers of the AVR family, and at work I even recently wrote some startup code for an ARM9 that used a few bits of assembly language.<br><br>However, I have to add that I really like the way you mixed your audio. I watched your video on a system that supports surround sound for the first time, and I have to say I really like how you switch between having your voice all around when talking straight into the camera and having your voice only come from the front when your&#39;e talking off camera and have subtle music on the rear channels.  I don&#39;t know for how long you have been doing it since I only had stereo sound so far, but I think this is really cool.

 I used to use a program called MCODER 2 on the Sinclair Spectrum, is that anything like BLITZ?  Used to program in Z80, 6502 and MAB8400 many years ago.  Work stuff on the 8400, playing on the 6502 but wrote many simple routines on the Z80 for my ZX81 and Spectrum, best one was sound on the ZX81 obtained by turning port 254 on/off very quickly to produce sound and with the help of my late mother tune the ZX81 and play music.  Nice to see a video on machine code it brings back many memories but unfortunately I have forgotten a lot after many years of not using a computer to program. by the way, I still have my ZX81 and Sinclair Spectrum.

 Ok, so a slight correction:<br><br>Java and C# are neither compiled to native machine code nor interpreted. Both are run on a VM. C# is actually derived from Java, as it started as a Microsoft implementation of Java and ran on the JVM for quite a while. The difference being that both Java and C# are compiled down to machine code, just not native machine code (though there are processors in existence that can natively execute JVM bytecode). It&#39;s not necessarily disingenuous to say that C# and Java are &quot;interpreted&quot; in the sense that they are not executed natively on a processor in most cases, but it is not correct to place them each in a different category.

 Minor nitpick: Java and C# are in the same category. C# gets compiled to CLI byte code to be interpreted by the CLR (or other CLI compatible runtime). 

 	Replies: ['Magnus J√∏rgensen', '@Dylan Turner It did. And C# takes a lot more from Java, than the other way around. In fact many(me included) see C# as Java done right.', 'Ryan Jay', '@Coda Highland Yeah at this point it&#39;s a semantic argument. These days even JavaScript is JIT compiled to machine code by the browser. I wouldn&#39;t quite call it a &quot;compiled&quot; language. Regardless of the semantics, Java and C# should be grouped the same (which IMO would be in the group not with languages that compile directly to machine language, i.e. C++)', 'Ryan Jay', 'Glad someone pointed this out. I assume the 8 bit guy is going off very old outdated knowledge. Like others said, Java hasn&#39;t been &quot;interpreted&quot; for a very long time. C# and Java are essentially the same now - compiled to an intermediate and then compiled to machine language at runtime with the JIT compiler.', 'Coda Highland', '@Dylan Turner It could be interpreted. You can treat it as if it were interpreted, even, and the JIT is just an implementation detail. (And some JITs basically just unroll what the interpreter would have done and only optimize it on a later pass.) This is a better description of the semantics.', 'bozimmerman', 'You are correct -- Java did not originally use a JIT compiler, but I it has since JDK 1.2, which would be around 1996.']

 	Replies: ['Peter Johnson', '@avfusion still large for even small but non-trivial programs compared to the same thing in C++ - that&#39;s what I meant by &#39;large&#39; :)', 'avfusion', '@Peter Johnson The way GraalVM handles Java AOT is pretty interesting and is the main way they sidestep large binary sizes. They require you to state your use of reflections ahead of time, then tree shake the dependency list. What you end up with is a generally very lean binary that only includes the requisite portions of the StdLib.', 'avfusion', 'You weren&#39;t jebaited. In terms of his own chart, Java and C# should have sat in the same category no matter where he put them. It&#39;s hard to make a point when you contradict yourself in your own explanation.', 'Peter Johnson', '\u200b@gigaherz You&#39;re correct in that AOT compilation will not be able to make use of the same kind of aggressive optimizations that the JIT can. Runtime heuristics can allow a JIT to remove loops and branches that are never entered (but cannot be determined to be inactive at time of compilation), unroll short loops, cache and inline results of function calls, etc.. Generating the heuristic data takes some time (and this is why it appears that JIT code is &#39;slower to spin up&#39;) - the optimizer will not start kicking in until ~1000 iterations of a loop, for example. It also has the negative effect of the optimizations being aggressive, so while the code will be optimistically run (same as in a CPU branch predictor), the optimizations may need to be thrown out if it turns out that the preconditions that made the optimization possible in the first place no longer hold. If this happens, new heuristic profiling will be performed and the code re-optimized if necessary.<br>The negative side of this is mostly academic except in the case of high performance games and simulations, where state thrashing can lead to the JIT repeatedly optimizing and then discarding a hot path.', 'gigaherz', '@Peter Johnson My understanding is that AOT compilation of bytecode/cil has lower startup times, but the runtime speed tends to not be as high because it doesn&#39;t have enough information to make good predictions of how the program will run. JIT meanwhile takes longer to spin up but it has the luxury of generating code based on runtime statistics, so it can do more aggressive optimization and prediction.']
