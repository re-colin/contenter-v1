 I&#39;ve started boycotting companies that have annoying ads and I recommend everyone to do the same. If enough people boycot this, eventually the extra cash they make from people that are influenced positively by ads will not compensate the amount of cash they spend on ads.

 The never ending battle between people wanting to use the internet for free to get info, have fun, etc and companies that want you to buy their stuff reminds me of the battle between software companies trying to keep their software from being copied and users trying to copy their software (anti-piracy). It&#39;s a never ending arms race. But just remember that if you are getting services for free, like what Google does with so much of their company...YOU are the product.

 It&#39;s 2022 and the ad industry stills uses dark patterns to make users accept tracking, clearly acting in bad faith. Advertising should be made illegal, similarly to drug dealing and ads should be considered a schedule 1 drug....they&#39;re more addictive and do more harm than many  other schedule 1 drugs

 It‚Äôs funny I find this video, right after I mention to a friend that YouTube and YouTube Creators should get with Wikipedia to create a very thorough database of text and video for nearly anything in great detail. The videos could just be embedded snips of YouTube videos for demonstrations like how a gasoline engine works or how to make a fire. There are already millions of useable videos already made. And for historical information, YouTube Creators have already made thousands of great documentaries that could right along side text from various sources. I guess being YouTube you‚Äôd have to be ok with ads in Wikipedia.

 Advertisements, in general, are illogical.<br>If I have a need for an item, ex. something broke and I need a new one, then I already have the desire to purchase one and will do given financial opportunity.<br>If I have no need for an item, then viewing an advert for it will not generate need for one. (or the money to buy one)<br><br>If I like Coke and dislike Pepsi, then viewing an advert for Pepsi will not rewire my taste preferences and cause me to buy Pepsi over Coke. No matter how many times they say it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; or &quot;critics agree&quot;<br>If I have need of a general item such as &quot;a phone&quot;, then viewing a Samsung or Apple ad will not help me choose or influence my choice. I will look at video comparisons and benchmarks.<br><br>The only thing advertisements do is increase the price of the product as it&#39;s the customers that have to pay for the advertisements in the end.

 I&#39;ve been banging on about this for a very long time. The web needs to go back to being straight HTML and CSS as much as possible, with heavy restrictions on scripting. Some pages take just as long to load as they did in the days of dial up despite connection speeds being hundreds of times faster today, just because they&#39;ve become so bloated. What&#39;s wrong with text and images? That&#39;s all I&#39;m looking for. Why do I need a whole bunch of code executing just to load some content through a content loader, set up a bunch of stupid animations and crappy formatting that&#39;s bad for accessibility?<br><br>At least back in the days of flash you could leave it disabled and it was easy to selectively run it for certain applications where you knew it was absolutely necessary, because as a plugin it had defined boundaries. Javascript on the other hand is so pervasive, multiple scripts running on a page from different sources, and not restricted to any particular div or frame, and it&#39;s so overused it&#39;s very challenging to keep disabled everywhere, essentially making it impossible to control what runs on your own pc!<br><br>Advertisers complain about adblock, but I have no sympathy for them. They dug their grave years ago by making ads animated and with sound. Tracking was the final nail in the coffin. If it was just the odd static image that can&#39;t track you, like in a newspaper, I don&#39;t think nearly as many people would bother with adblocking.

 Ads, especially on mobile phones where it&#39;s harder to adblock are cancer. Most of the time I see an article I want to check out 70% of my screen is hidden by ads so I can only read two lines before scrolling.

 I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not on the individual users to just... Not keep third party cookies and JavaScript enabled? Why must a site bother me with my personal permission to use DOM APIs which I opted into using by downloading a specific web browser? All of this is bureaucratic salary grifting. And an easy way for companies to get canned for genuine simple mistakes. Nobody would ever issue a fine for a pop-under advertisement, why bother with this garbage? And why does Tom Scott present it as if it&#39;s an entirely fair status quo? That we are gonna be chasing, with legislation, the APIs which you consent to enabling by downloading a piece of software that has a JIT compiler/state machine?<br><br><br>It speaks volumes about the ineptitude and laziness of the general public who seemingly elect politicians that promise to &quot;secure their privacy&quot; instead of just launching the browser in incognito mode, or without cookies etc. If you gave me the kind of funding the EU&#39;s chambers have in order to create a web browser which did not allow tracking of any kind and was resilient against fingerprinting, I would work for a month and then smoke crack for the rest of my life.

The exception is YouTube, where I only F5 my way through various &quot;Ad 1 of 2&quot; cycles before finding some non-intrusive ad that doesn&#39;t require me to drop what I&#39;m doing to hide it.

 I would expect that those who downvoted are people hosting servers for the central purpose of ad revenue and crypto currency mining. (And perhaps a game maker with the same in mind ). The Web needs to be free of monetisation and abuse... it‚Äôs freedom to do what you want yes, but it‚Äôs also supposed to be free. If one disagrees with that then they can give up their own personal freedoms and rights... because that is essentially what will happen if this pattern is not stopped.

I mean if you dig deep into the web you will find such unarchived pages or disturbing paranormal videos that you don&#39;t just come across by accident or don&#39;t actively look for (if that makes sense)<br><br>I&#39;d actually love to see Tom react to the &quot;Dark Side of YouTube&quot; or &quot;Creepy Subreddits&quot; or &quot;Creepy Web Pages&quot; which will definitely also make him expand his horizon about why the web is also such a mess

 The cookies is the scary part yet most of the comments are focused on ads in general. I work in online ads and FYI too many ads absolutely drives down a sites traffic. We know this. In our industry, execs try to balance how many ads they can show with how many a user will tolerate e.g. user experience is important. But these ads also allow people running food blogs, for example, to make money off that blog, make more content with that money, and eventually make enough to turn that blog into a career. But yes we know the ads can be annoying. Every suggestion I make involves less ads. But just like supporting youtubers, these ads allow higher quality content to exist for free. Cookies are where it becomes greedy. They let advertisers pay more money to target specific groups, which isn‚Äôt surface level bad, but allowing random companies access to detailed profiles on us is a recipe for disaster.

 The most infuriating thing is when the site in response to a &quot;no cookie&quot; request deliberately takes it so literally as to not store a cookie with info about that &quot;no cookies&quot; preference. Instead, one of the million &quot;third party&quot; vendors or whatever is the option that enables the &quot;yes/no&quot; cookie, disguised behind some obscure company name. The advertisers and site designers will take the absolute piss at any given opportunity to try and squeeze a few extra cents. The ony thing i&#39;ve seen work against the ever repeating cookie popup is, ironically, an adblock filter blocking that site element from loading.

Initial box says &quot;accept all / customise&quot;, and if you customise, everything <i>should</i> be off, and then it asks you &quot;accept all / save and close&quot;. The accept all is of course big and green, while the customise/save are grey and looks disabled.

 This is why I have done two things:<br>- Disabled cookies globally, and enable them per site basis. I&#39;ve allowed Google-cookies since I use Google services, but every Facebook-cookie is denied.<br>- I&#39;ve installed an extension that blocks all third party requests, aside from basic images and text. But scripts, frames and other media is blocked. Then I enable them per-sitte basis, such as allowing Google video serving video to YouTube and YouTube to show up on other sites as playable video. But all third party requests from for example Facebook is blocked. My browser won&#39;t even make a request to Facebook, unless it&#39;s an image. But the like share button is a script, so that request isn&#39;t made.<br><br>This is a poweruser tool. Several websites will break as they use third party scripts. But some still work, and some will still give you a readable page even if not all functions are there. Third party scripts are for example one that makes drop-down menus work, for video players, as well as the cookie consent popup. So no more of that.

 There should really be a chrome extension that reads what&#39;s on your page, recognises the box and immediately opts out. Kind of how ad-blocker works.

 I also should note that while the word &quot;cookie&quot; in english speaking countries could mean two things (the baked cookie or the web browser cookie), in non english speaking countries the word cookie only means web browser cookie, because for the baked cookie they probably have a word in there own language. That kinda hurts the original meaning of the word cookie.<br>That&#39;s just what I thought after reading here someone saying that they often see the popup &quot;do you want cookies? Yes or learn more&quot; to confuse people. Those phrases can only confuse native english speaking people, because outside of that the meaning is still clear.

 &quot;..why the Web is such a mess nowadays? Advertisers.&quot; - the video could have ended there and not much information would have been lost.<br>The web would still be fast if sites didn&#39;t use fullscreen videos as background image now. The web would still be accessible if sites didn&#39;t hijack your scroll wheel and didn&#39;t put text into images or scripted animations. The web would still have privacy if sites didn&#39;t try to track your every move, just to collect pointless data to extract irrelevant information about unimportant people to draw false business decisions about what they think are their customers.

 As someone who has been on the internet since my childhood in &#39;96 or &#39;97, the internet began to start sucking after web 1.0. This problem was further exacerbated when smart phones gained internet capability. It is sad to say, but the relative exclusivity of the internet pre-smartphone meant that it was mainly for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and other nerds who had something interesting to contribute. Once the internet became for your &quot;everyperson,&quot; it began to significantly decline in the amount of joy that it sparked in my life. There are still some websites that spark this joy, but they are not youtube, they are not facebook, they are not on very many apps, and sadly that joy is much more sparse than it was 20 years ago.

 I hate content-covering popups so much more than cookie consent banners, and will make a mental note if your site uses them. They&#39;re just like paywalls, and lemme tell ya somethin&#39;, buddy. There ain&#39;t no content on your site I can&#39;t find somewhere else. You have not secured exclusive rights to a news story, and if you did, I just won&#39;t read it.

 This is probably the most comprehensive explanation of cookies available. Perfect for the layman to be able to understand.<br>The reason the GDPR is ineffective is because it puts the onus on the website and not the browser for giving you the option to not be tracked. The irony is now people are thoughtlessly, explicitly agreeing to terms when entering websites which turbo charges the legal ability of those companies like Facebook or Google to continue further developing this practice. You can&#39;t use most websites or apps without making this agreement. There remains no visibility to what is really happening behind the scenes either.<br>For the GDPR to be effective, it has to put the onus on browsers to provide controls that allow blocking of third party cookies. This means that regulators have a greater scope while only having a minimal number of businesses to monitor closely, perhaps even a system of code being recorded to public or regulated library. This would naturally be the type of system in place for industries such as architecture where it is in the public interest to know the nature of what has been built around them for the sake of future management and as a way of ensuring quality control.<br>No company should be above the law and these behemoths have been able to run riot mostly because they&#39;re so easily able to prey on a lack of understanding of technology. Politicians aren&#39;t developers and these issues are often explained to them by the very influence they seek to regulate.

 There is something very important missing in Tom&#39;s explanation when it comes to cookie banners. Tom mixes up the word &quot;advertisers&quot; here (or at least doesn&#39;t explain it in enough detail). The way Tom puts it, it sounds like companies like Google or Facebook would put these boxes there but that&#39;s not true for most cases. There are mostly two different reasons for why you see these banners. 1) companies that want to sell stuff and 2) people or companies that want to generate money with ads. 1) wants to know if you clicked on an ad somewhere in the internet and then bought something in the company&#39;s online store. They simply want to know if the money they spend on ads is worth it (e.g. if they generate conversions from their ads). There are metrics such as Return on Ads Spend (ROAS) that advertisers look at. If you disagree on these cookies, advertisers don&#39;t know if the money they spent at Google or Facebook was worth it, they only see that you clicked on an ad at some point. 2) is mostly the thing Tom talks about. So people or companies that actually have ads on their site and transfer the user data to Google and co. for personalized ads.

 People being the problem is actually spot on... the &#39;net (not just the web) became a very different place over the course of just a year or two in the mid-nineties. That was when it went from being accessible mainly for people in academia to being easily available to all. While on the whole a good thing, it also meant that a lot of good forums (generally all open back then) died from the influx of clueless, entitled morons demanding answers to their problems not even related to the forum topic...<br>What? Me bitter? Nah, surely not ;-)

 Here&#39;s the thing.  It&#39;s those advertisers that subsidize the cost of renting server space, or running your own server, so that you (and others) can AFFORD to put democratized content online.  Remove advertising, and you destroy the Internet.  The world economy, despite the fact that Star Trek asserts that it can be so, cannot operate altruistically.  Things still need to be paid for.

Then the creators of said content try to make money so they can continue to survive. <br>Then we cry about the ads. <br>I know things are more complicated, and no, I don&#39;t work for marketing etc. But I often feel we have become way too greedy. At the same time we are devaluing many things in our minds because they are free. We don&#39;t think of how it would be if we didn&#39;t have cable tv or newspapers on the internet or Youtube . <br>I don&#39;t know what the solution is but we are on the fast track to a black mirror world where you pay for everything by watching ads and if you close your eyes you are forced to keep them open.

With more than 10 employees who can access PIA (answer emails, see usernames, ...) you need to hire a data protection officer (and you probably need one in the beginning anyway to understand all the requirements).

 I&#39;ve never really understood the whole targeted advertising thing.  I have never opted out of any tracking, and I have yet to see anything of any relevance.  I get ads for shoes from companies that don&#39;t make footwear in my size, ads to visit exotic holiday spots when I hate travelling, offers for credit cards that I am ineligible for, restaurant ads for foods I am allergic to, weight loss ads when I am not overweight, ads for gossip about celebrities I am too old to have ever heard of, the list goes on.  I am beginning to suspect that I am so unusual that there is just nobody advertising the sort of things I want to buy!  I suppose ultimately though it comes down to the fact that if you have to advertise it, it&#39;s because it&#39;s not very good.  If it was any good, word of mouth would take care of it and you wouldn&#39;t need to advertise.

 This video doesn&#39;t really get to the heart of why the Web is such a mess. The real reason has mostly to do with using the &quot;wrong&quot; abstractions to start with. Properly speaking, when I ask a website for a webpage, I&#39;m asking them for a &quot;program&quot; that&#39;s written in a language that allows me to safely execute it on my computer, without having to worry about whether it&#39;s going to meddle with my hard-drive or install a keylogger to record my keystrokes. It&#39;s a &quot;self-contained&quot; program that has permission to access the rest of Internet, but which does not have permission to access my files or my programs or my anything. This concept of a &quot;self-contained, safe program&quot; should have been the underlying concept upon which the web was built. Instead, we got a complicated story about documents and hyperlinks, and these ideas ultimately turned out not to be to the correct abstractions to build on. The history of the web is largely the history of how software engineers found ways to slowly move away from the &quot;hyperlinked documents&quot; point of view and toward the &quot;self-contained program with specific permissions&quot; point of view. Of course, these changes occurred not by radically changing the underpinnings of the web, but rather, by tacking further crap onto an already bloated base framework. This is the real why the web is such a mess today.

 If anyone actually wants to get rid of those popups: install uMatrix for the desktop or kiwi browser on Android (you can even transfer the full rule file to your phone and it works) and you are free from tracking and annoying ads/popups. It takes a bit of time to set it up but later your surfing experience is way better.<br>Especially with those fullscreen popups on your phone!

 Okay, for one, you managed to make an ad pop up during your pop-up bit despite my adblock, so good job there. There&#39;s only one kind of ad on youtube that can do that.<br><br>Also, the pop-ups in the US at least make it clear that if I don&#39;t accept cookies, I don&#39;t use the site (which given what they are is reasonable) and mention exactly nothing about tracking.

 Cookie Law made browsing from Europe incredibly more annoying. Some American sites even outright block EU visitors. Ironically, the state of cookie consent itself is saved in a cookie, so if you block cookies on your browser, the consent form will pop-up on every visit. <br>Even if the law might&#39;ve been well-meaning, I hate it. The privacy-concerned user probably already blocks third-party cookies inside their browser or has an add-on like Ghostery installed, so the law results in nothing but annoyance.

 Cookies in the beginning were extremely useful: they could significantly speed up browsing to a web site and they could store individual info on user preferences (upon the site functionality) that made browsing a better experience (given the limited bandwidth limits of the time). Then cookies started to grow, massively up to the point that web browser developers suggested a clean up from time to time to ensure the browser would not start crawling over time and usage. Then cookies started becoming the footprint of nowadays tracking system. It&#39;s funny to think that the web transformed rapidly over the last 1.5 decade but since I use also a niche os with its custom browser, I can check how the same sites I visit with my other devises. Well, turn of cookies and js scripts and you still have at the core : text, images, hyperlinks and videos. That&#39;s about it,behind all those fancy websites. Speaking of js that&#39;s another pain in the neck. Gmaps requires in desktop mode over 600mb or ram to display a single tab. The tech requirements are plain insane in order to retrieve a sort of info. As for the user consent upon third party tracking, that&#39;s another bs as many hide the options deep on the selection menu, forcing the regular Joe to just hit accept in order to proceed. Furthermore, even if you customize the third party tracking of a said website, upon returning it keeps asking for your full consent again and again. Tbh, I think in the future, devices such as a Pihole will be the norm, especially for the tech savvy users. But anyway, you are right, the web as it is right now, it&#39;s a mess.

 I use Firefox [they claim to not track me] and an ad-blocker [my favorite is uBlock Origin, downloadable for free.]  I am amazed that the powers-that-be haven&#39;t yet banned ad-blockers - there is still hope for humanity!   I pay my ISP enough money already for my internet access - I don&#39;t need to perpetuate the archaic broadcast radio/TV model that &quot;we supply the program material for free but in exchange we require your eyeballs glued to our ads as well&quot;.  Using obligatory push ads to hype products we don&#39;t need is one of the unrecognized problems in our economy.  Push back, folks!

 So the answer to &quot;why&quot; is simply &quot;advertising&quot;? Sorry, but this is hypocritical coming from a YouTube personality who likely thrives off of ad-revenue on his own videos.<br><br>Ads are ugly, sometimes creepy, and usually intrusive. And advertisers/publishers really should be mindful of how much advertising can hurt the user experience. (Perhaps they can do better.)<br><br>But the reality is customers (viewers in this case) often cannot or will not pay for content out of pocket, so publishers must often subsidize the cost of providing this information/entertainment through other means.... advertising. And they have to find ways to make that advertising effective/efficient if they&#39;re going to bring in enough ad revenue to justify making the content.<br><br>Otherwise there&#39;d be no such thing as free information on a world wide web. I&#39;d think Tom Scott, of all people would understand and appreciate this.

 I wouldn&#39;t even mind (slightly) less features if not agreeing to cookies.

This was some similar idea behind it like the content id system, where, anyone can, and this is nearly unpreventable, copy music / films on USB-Drives / CDs / ..., so they take this money to &quot;make up for the revenue lost&quot; by people doing that.

 Regarding the closing line- I&#39;d say that&#39;s not just true of the online world, but any artistic endeavor, any moral choice, and even any freedom by law. Along with the freedom to choose anything inevitably comes the ability for abuse. It&#39;s why you have such constant battles (especially in America) over legal rights and freedoms- trying to curtail the abuse without stepping on the freedom, which oftentimes is intrinsically impossible; to maintain the freedom, you have to maintain the possibility of its misuse. It&#39;s the double-edged sword of free will.

 Well if there were no advertisements, many of the the sites or the browser itself will have to monetize it directly from the consumer.

 If you ever wonder why governments classify everything, fingerprinting is your simple example. A bunch of harmless information can be put together to clearly identify you out of every other person in the world. On it&#39;s own, each piece is perfectly safe, but when someone can took at all of it... so you end up hiding, obscuring and just flat out removing data because you never know what could be used against you.

 we need to completely rework laws about cookies and advertising<br>firstly, the only cookie allowed to be called a cookie are cookies that help a browser remember user settings and logins, any tracking and advertising cookies must find a more sinister name, as they are inherently unnecessary, malicious, and exploitative, i might suggest calling them cyanide, or expired cough syrup<br><br>secondly, tracking and third-party cookies must be off by default, the setting to turn them on must be hidden in a separate page, not to be turned on through a pop-up, and this page must thoroughly detail in layman&#39;s terms everything they do with these cookies, if your 95 year old great grandma can&#39;t reasonably understand it, the page has failed and the site has to pay a fine<br><br>thirdly, much like as a standard all electronics have to accept any interference [though i&#39;m sure this means something other than what i think it means], sites must accept any and all non-intrusive changes made by the user or scripts/plugins the user has installed, this means sites legally cannot circumvent attempts to block ads, disable scripts, or block third-party cookies, as long as a change the user has made is not permanent and/or does not affect other people&#39;s experience of the site, the website cannot legally resist it<br><br>fourthly, if your website is a marketplace of any kind, it must be impartial, and it must not have advertisements, this means no one may buy a &#39;sponsored&#39; position, no one may pay to manipulate user reviews, and the website has no power to curate reviews, no more of this &quot;review was not posted as it was unrelated&quot; crap that is almost exclusively used to hide negative reviews

Oh, and while many people had great hopes on the GDPR‚Ä¶ in the background most companies just sign DPAs (agreements) with their other companies and track you like nothing has happened. Regarding browsers: it helps to use the &quot;idontcareaboutcookies&quot; browser extension and disable Javascript for the more annoying sites.

 Very good explanification. The battle continues, which is what you notice if you have NoScript and ublock:origin plugins in your browser. After the last firefox upgrade, I got the occasional &quot;blanked out ad&quot;, an x second long blank screen where (I&#39;m guessing) others would see ads, with a Skip Ad button. A few weeks later, I&#39;m guessing ublock has updated again, so that&#39;s disappeared and I get back to watching the video immediately again. Unless of course, you somehow managed to get Youtube to stop running ads in/through your videos. :D

 I sort of sympathise with them... Here we have this huge service which many try and make a living from, and we want itfor free (except for connection costs.) So if content providers want to monetize their service, they seem only to have options of either ads or subs.  People don&#39;t want subs and try and block ads, so where does that leave them?  <br><br>I think platforms like YouTube do it best, which effectively models the way that TV works.  You provide content, and the platform provider organises monetization and pays you a cut.  Of course, that leaves content providers open to cyber bullying from those platform providers (unfair demonitization is becoming a bigger problem) but I&#39;ve no idea if there&#39;s a better solution.

 sure, its just an opinion, but the internet used to be better in teh days. my reasons for it: back in the end of the 90s, it was there, it was open to anyone, but but everyone wanted to be there. you were welcome to join but had to accept the way it worked. the more people came, the more it had to change in order to suit the newcomers that disliked certain ways. and when it hit ciritcal mass, companys started to ask the question: why DONT some people use it? and tried to get those people into the web. i view the web in some kind of a wild west mentality.. new lands, with its own order and law, that had downsides compared to the established east for sure, but the more people came, the more it formed to a copy of the east. courts were build, companys raised, factorys were build and after a while, pioneer culture disappeared. sure, things like youtube are great about the modern web, but i miss the times where there were less rules, where people saw the web as different place where eveyone is just a nickname and not all of the real world rules applied to the web and where saying something that others find offensive, wasnt something that brought a shitstorm throughout social media. but that kind of world can only exists, when the community is very smal and dies out, as soon as everybody is there and you have to govern it, that noone really gets offended by anything. and by that i mean things like &quot;you can see a womens nipple at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFRjZtYs3wY&amp;t=0m23s">0:23</a> in the video, theres no age verification.. THINK OF THE KIDS!&quot; and the video gets banned but the rest of the world, would be okay with that little slip in the video.. so to me, as someone who started using the web in 96, the golden times ended somewhere around 2006. and to give you an example of what i mean. while you were beeing called a nerd in 98 for using the internet, and a few years later, got all the music you wanted through napster, while the girls in my class cried because they had no money for the newest XY album that still think, computers and internet are for ugly buys that dont get laid.. they - 10 years later- used facebook at home and on the phone and posted status updates 5 times a day and today, even lead their kids to used smartphones and computers, do their workouts while listening to spotify and get all their stuff on amazon and send every hoax on facebook to their friends because the believe them

 I feel like an underlying problem is that there&#39;s no universal built-in way of monetizing content on the web. So, content creators bombard you with ads which require all those cookie consent prompts now or they hit you with a paywall. If you could just browse the web and creators receive their fair share from you consuming their content then none of this would be necessary. However, even a monetization system like this would be very hard to design in a way that it can&#39;t be easily exploited.

 I think GDPR is a good idea in principle, but really your preferences should be controlled by the browser instead of every site. That way you could set your browser to always reject advertising cookies.<br><br>Maybe they should beef the law up and create a standard for browsers to control cookie consent. Make it so web sites legally have to support that protocol, and only show the popup if the user&#39;s browser doesn&#39;t support it (or simply refuse access to the site and tell the user to update their browser).

 Since this often gets misunderstood, it&#39;s worth pointing out two things explicitly about the GDPR:<br>1. Those confusing screens that try to trick you into agreeing, are actually illegal. The GDPR doesn&#39;t allow this. It just doesn&#39;t get enforced hard enough yet.<br>2. Such consent popups aren&#39;t necessary for functional cookies, eg. those that keep you logged in. If someone is asking you to place cookies, it&#39;s for something that benefits them and not you.

 The web has always been about representational state transfer, and so calling it stateless is a bit unfair - servers have state and so do clients. Cookies are aligned with this principle. Code on demand is also a fundamental part.  We shouldn&#39;t be trying to turn off cookies or JavaScript, as you alluded to they are vehicles for creativity and capability. The root problem is the abuse of these things.  It&#39;s a bit like saying get rid of cameras because of facial recognition.  Well sure you don&#39;t want a camera on all the time but they remain useful.  Cookies aren&#39;t unique in their abilities to identify users. Any website that requires you to sign in can obviously do this, and if it weren&#39;t for the horrid pace of most corporate software development, even if we all disabled cookies, they would just start embedding tracking SDKs from their advertising partners, or using hidden assets such as images that are fetched from a dynamically generated URL that itself represents the cookie, then forwarding that request to the advertiser on the backend.  I say this because if we continue to treat the symptoms and not the problem the web will keep being a game of whack a a mole for privacy concerns.  This is because the real problem is most of us don&#39;t want to pay for websites, and not only the content but the actual hosting costs money.  At least the most popular kinds of it. Even Wikipedia frequently needs to beg for donations.  An analogy would be public broadcast television vs. mainstream ad subsidized.<br><br>Hosting costs can be really cheap if done right, at least for certain content, the vast majority of the web can be hosted for pennies per month when one considers only personal and scientific, public content, but ad revenue is the only thing keeping many content rich or media heavy sites free.  Where do you draw the line between &quot;paywall begging we need money to be able to function as journalists&quot; and popups?<br><br>Sorry, I&#39;m not trying to make a specific argument, just that it&#39;s interesting to think about in context with the not too distant past.

In many situations, the ad impression isn&#39;t worth enough to exchange for the content if it can&#39;t be targeted using ad personalization. Ideally, there&#39;d be a choice to view personalized ads or pay directly, but such a system is challenging due to the very small amounts of money involved.

 I never google search while logged into a google account and every so often they annoyingly ask if I allow them to track my searches etc. and that is conveniently set to yes by default. Being that already VERY irritating they keep making the settings to disable all this hidden more and more and more in multiple screens and clicks. EU should fine Google for that !

 Awareness being neccesary for people to peddle their products puts us in a position as a society and species that as long as we wish to earn optimal money we need to engage in practices that also optimize peoples awareness of the products we have. Being annoying is not important, if you know something exists you can buy it if you need it. The &quot;Any publicity is good&quot; that gets thrown around does not explain this issue well at all.<br>This further makes short and repetitive adverts better then long and entertaining ones because its not about entertaining the people who need to know your products just exist as that is expensive compared to just legitimizing yourself with repitition. Some people might avoid to buy your products because off how annoying or often an advertisement is but those are also not the people who needed them.<br><br>This isnt an issue with the web really its an issue with how we allow ourselves to sell all of our products.

 I don&#39;t think consent-based permission for tracking is even sufficient. To reliably give consent, you need to understand what you&#39;re consenting to, and websites are perfectly happy to use jargon and obfuscation to keep you from understanding web tracking, even to the point of making it seem completely good. While it may be easy to see the convenience of a personalized internet, the cost of it is abstract and hidden.

 Couldn&#39;t the lawmakers have stipulated that a person should have the right to say no and still access content? Or would that have disrupted the ability to maintain login sessions at all?<br><br>Personally, the only reason why I installed ad blockers to begin with was the advent of animated ads and sites that abuse auto-refresh to disrupt what I&#39;m reading in order to create more ad Impressions, which even advertising companies shouldn&#39;t like because that&#39;s actual fraud. If I pay an Advertiser that 500 people should view my ad I wouldn&#39;t be happy to learn that one person saw the ad 500 times and we&#39;re so mad they will never buy my products ever because they now associate my product with frustration. And that&#39;s not even including all the malware and illegal content that gets spread via advertisements. Literally every news site that I have read which asked me to turn off ads ultimately served up malware if and when I did so which resulted in me looking for ways around ads again because while I don&#39;t mind some advertisements I don&#39;t want my eyes beans Rod to flashing images, or to have my computer endangered the, or to have my speakers blast with a video that&#39;s playing somewhere in the background. some websites even played radio ads in the background and it took forever to find out which tab was doing it before browser started to put a little speaker icon in the tabs.<br><br>The kinds of ads we had in the 90s, banner ads and the occasional pop up, weren&#39;t all that bad in comparison.  yes, we had the occasional flashing image, and there were the malicious ads that tried to install malware or would play some audio through your computer&#39;s internal speaker, the one that makes those beeps, rather than the speakers you plug in, but at least those ads were few and far between. We didn&#39;t but at least those ads were few and far between.<br><br> as a business owner I refuse to use internet advertisements entirely because I don&#39;t want my products associated with user frustration. I don&#39;t want my product to be the thing that makes you mad. That&#39;s just bad business.

 The amount of obscenely intrusive gif ads and surprise pop-ups is why I can&#39;t read the vast majority of text-based content on the web. For someone with OCD, it can be like making all of the wheelchair ramps steeper and steeper. At a certain point, I&#39;m blocked from going to your site because of my disability. Obviously, that&#39;s not exactly true, but it is effectively true because I need to protect my mental health, at some point. It&#39;s not worth it. I even manually add blocks in my ad-blocker, because I know I&#39;ll forget. (For example, CNET auto-plays video with audio on, so they&#39;re blocked.)

 When a website tries to block me from reading content because I block their ads, I take great pleasure in opening the Dev Console and just disabling their block. It&#39;s usually a combo of adding a display: none; and setting overflow-y: auto; on the main content.  Sometimes its a bit of a chore to dig through all the markup mess that modern platforms are adding though.

 There was a &quot;freedom to advertise&quot; debate a while back, too, that was kinda interesting -- force a right to advertise, prevent users from blocking ads by law (and a less interesting war about paying for showing news snippets - but also kinda hilarious really). I mean, it&#39;s my PC -- but it&#39;s your website and content... how much freedom do I have, how much should you? Also, many a website originating in the US (media outlets are notorious for this) still show &quot;Due to GDPR we can&#39;t display content to you. We&#39;re working on that.&quot; or some similar crap, trying to make GDPR the bad guy. :-) You did a wonderful video about copyright on (not just) the Internet... I think it&#39;s time for one on advertising there.

These are all brute facts.<br><br>If anything, you <i>help</i> the corporate machine.  After all, you&#39;re not going to buy their products anyway.  Loading the ad means the corporate machine pays the content creator at no benefit to itself.', 'Robman5105', '@John Undefined I&#39;m going to leave up my other reply for transparency. I apologize in advance, but you sort of struck a nerve.<br><br>My argument is emotional, as is yours. It is a function of our minds. You argue for the content creator. I argue against the corporate machine. They are a functionally evil apparatus. The purpose of social media is to gather data which is then sold to advertisers. They take that data and use it to craft very targeted ads. Those ads serve the purpose to sell you a new product. Do you know where and how many of these products are made? In third world factories. With workers treated as disposable assets and lax environmental regulations spilling tons of pollution. Of course we could also examine the many wars and economic destruction that this sort of global trade creates. This is all done for the benefit of a small number of people. You see, I don&#39;t like that. So if blocking those ads hurts this system in any way, then I feel good about doing it. Even if some &quot;content creators&quot; have to be lost as casualties along the way. I&#39;m not a hero, but it sure as hell does more than waving some poster board at a &quot;protest&quot;.']

 Great video, only thing I&#39;d add is that it would&#39;ve been nice to talk about non-commercial web. ActivityPub federation with Mastodon, Pixelfed, Lemmy, PeerTube, and so on is a big community nowadays with millions of users. Since the federation is open source and non profit, there is no incentive to make ads or track users. In fact, both Mastodon and Lemmy are explicit about not doing any tracking. I think the federation is resurrecting the original vision of the web where sites are run by regular people instead of just having a handful sites run by giant corporations. Meanwhile, VPS solutions have become very cheap nowadays and containers make it easy to package apps making it more accessible for people who want to host an instance of the app.

 Tom, would you consider doing a part two to this, about the value of content? That&#39;s a huge part of the push for advertising - I thought musicians got something noticeable (if still small) per radio play they got, but web streaming gives miniscule payments. It feels like the consumer wants all the content for free, but with no payment and there is a lack of appreciation for paying for quality journalism etc. I get how the advertisers are making the browsing experience a bit rubbish but should we consider that trade off acceptable? I don&#39;t think there is a clean answer, it just feels like a corollary to this

 To &quot;fix&quot; the mess:<br>1.) Pass universal privacy law. This law would require the DEFAULT use of a website to be NO TRACKING COOKIES and NO RESELLING OR PERSONAL PRIVATE DATA.<br>2.) Websites must decide whether they are publishers or platforms. If YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. decide to be platforms, then they cannot restrict (via discrimination) thought or determine what is or is not fact, fiction or anything in-between. <br>3.) Individuals who post or upload content will be the &quot;publishers&quot; on what are otherwise social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.).<br>4.) Platforms that engage in censorship along ideological, racial, religious, etc. grounds are subject to lawsuits from the public AND governments.<br>5.) Websites, news sources, etc. should identify on their homepages if they have actively contributed to political candidates, parties, causes, etc.  This includes lobbying.<br>6.) Favorable coverage by a &quot;news source&quot; should be subject to campaign finance laws. In other words, if CNN, MSNBC or Fox News wants to give free access to candidates that is deemed by courts or the FCC to constitute as a political contribution, then they should be held to said limits. Moreover, they should be fined if they exceed those limits. <br>7.) Websites must IDENTIFY if they use tracking cookies.

 Javascript/CSS/HTML are responsible for the web mess. &#39;Development&#39; using a mashup of the worst technologies ever hacked together for user interface creation is obviously going to result in an abysmal mess, totally lacking in the consistency enforced by a standard UI toolkit library. These messes are massively bloated, lacking in basic accessibility features like keyboard shortcuts, and are usually created by mediocre non-programmers who don&#39;t think twice about bundling multiple copies of chrome with their crappy re-packaged web pages while seeming being committed to following a crazed approach of ad-hoc assembly of dodgy amateur created micro-dependencies into horrific monstrosities, instead of defining and following some architectural vision. I marvel at the fact that frankenstein beasts like node.js and electron have actually been built, and that there are people who believe that end users will actually accept web pages in a window as an alternative to using software.

 Great as always, Tom. It&#39;s a shame though that you seem to overlook the fact that advertisers are in competition against each other. Of course, a business could &quot;just stop advertising&quot; but any that did would die very quickly. Anyone wanting to sell online needs some kind of advertising, if only to get ahead in search rankings. So long as one business is able to pay to get their advert placed above others, everyone has to play the game. The price of the internet being open and free is that, sadly, some people will misbehave and ruin it for everyone. That same freedom can improve the web, however. Wikipedia is a great example. New browsers and standards will help. The conflicts of interest (such as the one you point out) are an obvious problem, as is market dominance. But how do you solve that without the risk of involving regulators (fundamentally at odds with the freedom of the web)?

 These problems are a big part of why I browse the web mostly using a &quot;Web 1.0&quot; browser called Dillo.  It&#39;s like &quot;reader mode&quot; but even more lightweight.  It doesn&#39;t even have javascript.  And it&#39;s so small and quick, I can run hundreds of instances in less resources than a single Chrome tab.<br><br>I still need a full-featured browser for heavyweight web applications like google docs, youtube, and facebook... but at least I can get away from the hostile mess of predatory web malware the rest of the time.

 The question is<br>Can tools like ublock origin and many others defeat advertisers effectively?<br>Currently, the only option feels like it&#39;s using tor or just use the internet knowing you are being tracked. Using tor is not very intuitive because you still want to get the fonts the sites give, you want to be able to save preferences and data of websites, and etc. You want to be able to have an account on these sites to save achievements or talk with people. You customize Tor and you no longer have an anonymous fingerprint<br><br>I like to think that these tools may be enough, but with the fingerprinting thing, I am not so sure anymore. They also use your ip to get info about you. I mean, I already know a lot about these things and I consider myself to be very savvy, but this video makes me start to lose hope. We just need a different web browsing design altogether maybe??? I just ignored fingerprinting for the longest time tbh.

 I&#39;m fine with adverts. I&#39;m fine with watching an advert before viewing an article. I&quot;m tired and annoyed and otherwise chapped about having to wait for an advert to load before viewing an article, the sheer amount of adverts, and pop-ups that block the pages you&#39;re trying to read. With no paper, ink, and presses needed, and therefor much lower costs, it should be viable to have the same profit margin on the web as newspapers and magazines had, but with fewer adverts.

 As there is a section of human society who have been trained from childhood to respond to adverts, advertising is a viable method of making money without paid subscriptions. There is plenty of content I would not pay to view but may browse if it appears free to do so as I don&#39;t know if it is worth reading until I have read some of it. If I must allow cookies to access a website, I usually open a private window. <br><br>Perhaps we need some sort of national web content fund where creators are paid per view, but since a botnet could then make you very rich, don&#39;t hold your breath.

 Funny thing is, because Facebook is so ubiquitous, and because their Share buttons are actually desired for most people, Facebook in particular is <b>very</b> good at tracking people. Even with Adblock, since those buttons aren&#39;t technically ads and thus aren&#39;t blocked by it by default. The number of times I&#39;ve been barely looking into something, then hop onto Facebook and see a &quot;sponsored post&quot; related to it, is crazy. On the one hand, I should probably adjust my Adblock settings to block those. On the other hand, I don&#39;t do anything that I really care if anyone sees/knows, so... meh.

 I have an online store and am constantly getting companies (including my hosting platform) telling me I should have pop-ups for newsletter sign ups, points systems, live chat and more. <br>They want me to pay to add things to my website that are the vary things I hate encountering on other websites. What is worse, they are literally telling me that I need to spend a bunch of money on doing things that might, maybe, possibly, lead to making a little money. (Or, in the case of the points system, extremely lose me money.)<br>Even promoting a coupon code is a huge cost. A 10% off coupon code could cost me $20 when used, but also costs me more to get it listed with a coupon searching browser extension or even more if I just run an advertising campaign.

 a way to satisfy advertisers and end users alike would be something like limited tracking, where you can see what they do on a site but cant remember it, so if i search something like &quot;how to set up a tent&quot;, i get ads for tents and outdoor equipment, but if i press the x, then the fact that i searched fountain pen, and that i should get fountain pen ads, gets deleted like my search history does after my parents leave me home alone for 3+ hours. this lets advertisers target their ads so no ad is wasted, and lets end users keep their privacy, so everyone should be happy to some extent

 Advertising legitimately ruins everything. It ruined TV, it ruined radio, it ruined the internet. You said there are two reasons the web is a mess?

All of you who are upset over advertising and other Internet monetization - how else do you propose that YouTube keep their servers running and programmers paid? How else do you propose that the tier 1 Internet backbone companies keep their routers running and their network engineers paid? How else do you propose that video makers be able to devote their time to making videos rather than other paid jobs? <br><br>People revolted over subscription services, so those aren&#39;t an option anymore. People want Internet services to not have a monetary price tag, so the price has to be paid in some other fashion. Don&#39;t expect tech people to provide services for free - tech doesn&#39;t magically happen.

 Good work Tom! You explain these things clearly so that even those with little computer/web experience can understand! Perhaps you could augment this video with another that focuses on the intimate relationship between advertisers and government agencies; How they share information about the populace as &quot;meta-data&quot; and how that data is used. As you say, like everything else that on the internet, that could be used for good or for VERY NOT good purposes.

 I&#39;ve often wondered why cookie consent UIs are not built into the browser instead. That is, websites have to use the browser&#39;s own interface to cookie consent before they are able to store any cookies for the user. In that way the user is in control and can do things like backing up and restoring their consents, adding rules, etc. Also the interface would be consistent, meaning that users would not be confused with awkward consent forms and would know what to do immediately as soon as they&#39;d learned the browser&#39;s UI. Seems like a much better system to me. 

 	Replies: ['Simon Pugnet', '@Ichijo Festival I agree; I think education in this area is very important and these confusing consent forms just help to muddy the waters. Hopefully more content like that which was presented in this video will help the average user to understand what it&#39;s all about, and perhaps eventually we&#39;ll get some kind of a browser standard in this area.']

 Adblock is my greatest friend. Advertisers are like those annoying people who will follow you at the market to buy something desperately. I also think this advertiser strategy is outdated, but apparently it still makes money. I have no idea why and how. The only time I actually clicked an ad it was by accident. Never have I ever thought; hey this looks like a  useful ad, lets buy it... If it&#39;s anything I have learned as a programmer in the marketing/e-commerce business is that just don&#39;t, it&#39;ll kill your soul. 

 	Replies: ['Midnight', '@Jared Bowden that&#39;s also the reason I always was so chilled about all the tracking and everything. Facebook showed me nothing but crap ads for products I wouldn&#39;t want to have if they paid me for it.<br>So, as long as <i>Facebook</i> doesn&#39;t seem to know anything useful about me, I&#39;m fine...<br>But then again, I&#39;m disabling cookies everywhere I go now, so... Maybe I just avoided the worst tracking sites before.', 'rytan 451', '@Jared Bowden Well, there is an explanation. Advertising isn&#39;t targeted at people like you, who don&#39;t act on advertisements. They&#39;re targeted at the sort of people who would act based on advertisements. Even if 99% of people never acted on the advertising, if the remaining 1% of people who acted on the advertising paid for the cost of advertising, then it&#39;d be worth the cost to the companies. For internet advertisements, the ads that are acted on cost much more to the people buying the advertisements than the ads that you press &quot;skip ad&quot; the moment the 5 second timer runs out. And they&#39;re fine with that. It means that they only pay more when they&#39;re earning money. <br><br>Why then do the ads end up reaching people like us, who just ignore, skip, or even make an active effort to avoid products with intrusive advertising? Well, if it&#39;s cheaper to blast the ads to everyone than it is to avoid sending the ads to people like us, then everyone gets a face full of ads.', 'Jared Bowden', '&quot;. I also think this advertiser strategy is outdated, but apparently it still makes money. I have no idea why and how.&quot; This + 10000.  I just <i>don&#39;t</i>  <i>get</i> <i>it</i> .  I would imagine big business are putting lots of analysis to see what makes money and what&#39;s worth it, so obviously Advertising must be beneficial to them cause they just keep advertising more and more.  But, I&#39;ve never actively clicked on an ad, I&#39;ve never seen anything in ads that I thought was worthwhile, targeted advertising my ass.<br><br>It makes me wonder what these advertising companies know.  Like, I understand that most advertising is subliminal or indirect; maybe that has way more of an effect than I think.  There is also a possibility that advertising is just one of those &quot;things that companies do&quot; and it is actually just a waste of money, but if that were the case I would think someone had figured that out by now.', 'Markle2k', 'I used to wonder at how useful the AdSense text ads next to your search were.

 The sad part is that essential cookies and other forms of local data storage are all exempt from the cookie law, so all of the sites that do show these popups (which as we know are almost all sites) do it just to track you. It&#39;s not like innocent sites are getting caught in the crossfire.

 With regards to GDPR and non-eu websites having to obey it, I&#39;m fairly sure that it only applies to non-eu websites which direct/aim themselves for EU citizens. So an international news site would have to comply, but a local Seatle coffee shop website that only aims to show locals when the opening hours are, wouldn&#39;t have to comply. The EU know the extent of where they can enforce laws, making it apply to any EU citizen anywhere at any time wouldn&#39;t be enforceable and they knew it, so they didn&#39;t try.

 Great, concise explanation. Well done! <br>Sadly, even sites and services that start out benevolently, quickly run into the problem of having to provide the servers to host their data. And those can be paid for either by donations - like Wikipedia does - or by running ads. <br>My hope is, that Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s original vision for the internet - a fully distributed net - will be possible with new and fast approaching tech. Blockchain promised exactly that, but has failed miserably thus far due to crazy inefficiencies and scalability issues and an innate tendency towards centralization. But there are others. <br><br>Holochain comes to mind, a fully distributed platform for apps that would allow services such as Wikipedia to be run on thousands of small home servers. They are on the verge of entering their open alpha phase.<br><br>@Tom Scott: Should you have some free time and energy to dive into the rabit hole of Holochain, I would love to see your assessment!

 The laws should add &quot;all sites have to automatically apply cookie settings sent by browser&quot; so instead of you clicking all the settings and consents, browser would do it. You would specify the default in the browser and it would sent it to the sites instead of you and you would change them for some specific sites.

 As a web professional, it&#39;s disturbing that this video is only presenting one side of things: &quot;ads = bad&quot;.

 It is very easy to blame the advertisers. The advertisers help the content creators to generate income. From buying a website to hosting, creating content, maintenance and security all comes with increased charges. No one runs a website for charity and if people pay for the content that they access then we can avoid this mess. For long, since the creation of the Internet and web, this idea of accessing free content is some how strongly built inside everyone&#39;s thought process. This needs to change. A vast majority still looks for free content, pirate and copy software downloads, not even thinking about all the hard work and the production cost that went into creating it. Still have the audacity to point fingers and complain about corporate greed. Go Figure!

This way developers could also easily make browser-wide &quot;Deny all cookies&quot; setting, so the whole hassle would be gone and users would only allow cookies on sites that in fact deliver them some value.

 	Replies: ['Chaidan', '&quot;rejecting no cookies never being used&quot; just means that some cookies are never used. The two &quot;not&quot;s at the start probably don&#39;t change the meaning. Since cookies only really exist (in memory) if they are &quot;used&quot; (written to, read from etc.), a response of &quot;yes&quot; is unable to satisfy. If you answer &quot;yes&quot; they will be unable to comply with your request.', 'Seth', '@Hamburger Cheeseburger actually i have now seen it backwards. we are used to pressing the button without color for &quot;no&quot; and now they are swapping that around and making the cancel button have color. That only works if you also switch their positions too. Usually &quot;no&quot; is on the right, but then it is on the left.', 'feha92', '@sergey Yes they do, there are non-cookie (and indeed non-tracking) ways to store preferences nowadays. Mostly because of javascript being a thing. With js they can store data locally (that isn&#39;t sent to server unless they script it to do so, but then its tracking again, so they &#39;cant&#39; do that without consent), which they then read during every load and dynamically apply the settings (ie. only create the overlay if the user hasnt rejected already).<br><br>Personally, I simply tend to put my adblocker to the task instead (since noone wants to make their forms non-intrusive), and set it to automatically filter out a specified element. Which just so happens to be the intrusive form.', 'feha92', '@MB DG quintuple would be a single negative, no? quadruple would be a positive.', 'hecko', '@sergey there&#39;s often a category of &quot;necessary cookies&quot; that&#39;s always enabled for this sort of thing (it&#39;s legal under gdpr)<br>but i&#39;d imagine most folks wouldn&#39;t know that so the excuse works']

 This is only half the story. If you actually try to implement the confirmation you will discover just how difficult such a thing is when you want to use third party plugins such as disqus for your comments section, scripts for downloading fonts, analytics. Even if the user is eventually going to agree or disagree, loading those things conditionally is incredibly difficult if you are using something like a static site generator.<br><br>There is also the issue of different levels of enabled and the fact that every country in the EU actually has different cookie laws.

 And that&#39;s why every website that tries to force me into seeing ads or anything... is instantly banned for me. I would bypass a website that does it, even if it contains info I want. Just to send them a message of &quot;sorry, you won&#39;t get 0.003$ from me by making my browsing 10 times more annoying. Just give me the info or offer microdonations.&quot;.

 Having worked on both the cookie law project and the GDPR compliance project for my employer it doesn&#39;t help that they were terribly written laws from the point of view of extracting requirements for what compliance actually looks like. Cookies especially we ended up massively overdoing the solution because nobody understood what the minimum required to be compliant was so we built this massive list of preferences where you could check and uncheck stuff like essential cookies, tracking cookies, targeted marketing etc. and then other sites got away with just banner text saying &quot;we use cookies, OK?&quot;

 Then of course there&#39;s the problem of how we pay for the internet.  All that content requires a lot of people&#39;s time to create, and they need to get paid somehow.  Unless we want a payment model of &quot;insert coins to view more internet&quot;, we are kinda stuck with advertising as the business model.  The cheapest way to advertise is to advertise just to the people who will actually react to the ad, thus the tracking.

 There&#39;s a seemingly-endless war between advertisers and users as well. Users taking every possible measure to block advertisements, trackers, etc. And advertisers relentlessly trying to find new ways to force advertisements onto users and/or continue tracking them. A myriad of browser plugins, programs, and apps have been made, all designed to block advertisements, cookies, scripts, fingerprinting, and other intrusions to privacy or otherwise. People want to just browse privately and in peace, but as long as their views, clicks, and information are all worth money, there are companies out there that will fight to ensure that doesn&#39;t happen.
