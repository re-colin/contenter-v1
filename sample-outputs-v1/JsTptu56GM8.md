Description: 
 Computers store text (or, at least, English text) as eight bits per character. There are plenty of more efficient ways that could work: so why don't we use them? And how can we fit more text into less space? Let's talk about Huffman coding, Huffman trees, and Will Smith.

 This is the last of the three trial Basics videos! This pushed my quick-explanation skills to the limit, but I figure that &quot;slow down the video and replay if necessary&quot; is better than &quot;let people get bored&quot;...

 Actually there is such a thing as &#39;lossy&#39; text compression which attempts to rewrite the text using smaller words etc to still get the message across.

 Yea, my attempt at text compression when analysed came in at nearly 40% saving over not compressing. A lot of words were duplicated, there was a measure of cheating by assigning different ASCII codes for Upper &amp; Lower Case (ie using 8 bits like 7!). And where the words were adjacent, a byte to signify &quot;use&quot; previous word&quot; eg &quot;use&quot; cf &quot;+ful&quot;. 15000 max lexicon.  I would waste my time changing the algorithm even if Mr Huffman could get me to 50% - modern computers &amp; broadband make squeezing every last drop an academic time waster.

 Wikipedia says that Huffman invented this encoding method in 1952 when a student at MIT, however this same method (binary tree and popularity of letters) is how the Morse Code assigns combinations of dashes and dots to the English letters, and the telegraph is much older than 1952.  Morse Code doesn‚Äôt even have to include pauses (neither 0 nor 1) if you are using a fixed beat.

 I love the visualisation of these mathematical formulas that would never have been so easily understood for the learner. I always recall that at uni, a friend clearly stated that... The best uni were in the USA.. because they literally allow you to be hands on and that you disconnect and break through that human learner association. Whereas in the UK, we relied so much in our language and assumption to break through implied meanings and constructs....

 Can‚Äôt you just compress a word into a smaller string of text, like turn compress into cmprss, and each word has a unique compression (or smaller words might not have one) and then add a marker on the end of that compressed word to tell the recieving computer hey, turn it back, to stop computers being unable to differentiate between cmprss as a string of letters and cmprss as a word. Like, cmprss and cmprss‚Ä¢

 A little late, but there are 8 bits, 256 characters, because that would enough for all the keystrokes on an IBM Selectric typewriter keyboard, the input device for IBM computers, plus some computer commands we don&#39;t see (EOB, EOLN, START, STOP, etc). Since most computers were IBM computers, that became the standard (there used to be a lot of different standards depending on the computer manufacturer).

 Video 4 years old at this point, but relevant and awesome as ever. I am a big fan of compression, because I hate wasting anything in life. Hate wasting food, wasting water, wasting gas, wasting time......... And wasting space, physically and digitally! I like to experiment, what kinds of files can be further compressed through means like Winrar. Videos and images (like JPEG and PNG) usually can&#39;t be compressed any further, but I found out at some point, that for example Photoshop files (.psd) can often be heavily compressed. Depending on their content, really. But I have had compression rates of up to 93% on particular files. What a load of wasted space.

 the cleverness of Huffman coding is that, although you can end up with some characters using more than 8 bits, this only happens if the character is really rare, and typically it&#39;s only like one or two more bits. You&#39;re prioritizing the most common characters without the ambiguity of the na√Øve approach where you start with spacebar, e, t...

 But how does it knows how long the bits of one character are? 

 	Replies: []

109: David James 
 Huffman codes are NOT optimal.  For example, in your example, if your shortest single character code is 5 bits, then the last few characters in the message can have MUCH shorter codes with no ambiguity.  For example, if a period character is not so common in the entire message so the Huffman code is quite long for it, why not enter it twice in the character table and when you get close to the end of the message, just output much shorter codes for the last few characters such that there is no ambiguity.  For example, if the last character in the message is a period character, just give it a code of 0 (1 bit).  The decoder will see this and see that there is no more data, and interpret the single bit &#39;0&#39; as a period.  0 will be the prefix of many other character codes but so what?  It cannot be any of those longer bitstring characters cuz we ran out of data, so it MUST be a period.  Those short bit sequence characters will NOT be used anywhere except very near the end of the message where short codes will not cause ambiguity.  So what I am saying is build the normal Huffman tree but augment it with some shorter encodings for characters near the end of the message.  This can either be done manually (by inspection) or programmatically.  For example, suppose the code for &#39;.&#39; is normally 11111111 (8 ones).  You can enter it AGAIN in the table as a 0.  If a period appears at the end of the message, you would encode it as a single 0 rather than 8 ones.  The decoder will see that and translate it back to a period.  Simple.

 The need to store/send the tree along with the compressed data will certainly create extreme cases where the uncompressed ASCII text is more efficient than the Huffman Encoded text and the Huffman tree. Storing the alphabet in ASCII is 26 characters of 8 bits each for 208 bits. Storing it Huffman encoded is 6 characters 4 bits long and 20 characters 5 bits long for a 124 bits, but then the tree that converts that bit stream back into ascii characters will be (I think, I am not sure how the tree is exactly stored) 6 characters of 12 (4 bit Huffman to 8 bit ASCII) bits and 20 characters of 13 bits, for a total of 332 bits for the tree, and a total required to store/send, of 456 bits, more than double the fixed length ASCII encoding.<br><br>There has to be points where fixed length ASCII is more efficient storage wise than Huffman - and there are certainly ways to shorten the tree&#39;s size (say encode the numbers 0 to 25 and after decoding add 01000001 or 01100001 to get A-Z or a-z respectively), but is there a formula to find these points based for a used  alphabet N characters long, how long a base string is needed to ensure that the encoded bitstream and the tree combined are more efficient than the ASCII it started with?

 This is also why, strictly speaking, Morse code requires five modes. Dash, dot, letter space, word space, and off. When working with only on or off, it goes like this:<br>Dot: Signal, wait<br>Dash: Signal, signal, signal, wait<br>Letter space: wait, wait, wait<br>Word space: wait, wait, wait, wait, wait<br>Which is also why telegram or light signal Morse code is different than written Morse code.

 Text is very good to compress. But it does remind me of the times that compressed files got bigger then the original file. This happened with JPEG files which were actually compressed already or some EXE files... Well that was way back in the DoubleSpace / DriveSpace times with MS-Dos...

 	Replies: []

 Likely already said below, but lazy: the original ASCII code was only 7 bits, i.e. 128 possible values. The other 128 characters were added later as Extended ASCII. This included non-language characters, such as straight lines and 90 degree angles, often used to create &quot;windows&quot; or progress bars within DOS programs, for example. It might seem odd to have a 7 bit code, given that bytes are 8 bits wide, but... once upon a time, byte size varied from machine to machine. There were 6 bit bytes before 7 bit bytes came on the scene, and it wasn&#39;t until the IBM System/360 that we finally standardized on the 8 bit byte everyone* knows about today. As far as Huffman coding goes, that was a really clever approach!

 What&#39;s really interesting is that genetics has similar rules. Codons, for example, are made of three nucleotides. Each nucleotide taking the place of a bit. The bits represent amino acids, but the start and stop codons are used in a manner similar to assembly programming. <br><br>One big difference is that genetics isn&#39;t digital. Rather than two binary bit states there are four possible bit states:  A, T, C, and G.<br><br>To some it might seem like binary because the amino acids appear in pairs, but they pair between strands so that the genetic information can be copied. <br> <br>Each codon has a length of 3 bits, and because there are 4 possible states per bit that allows for 64 possible combinations.<br><br>What&#39;s even more interesting is that there are over five times as many proteins as there are genes to code for. To oversimplify things, the epigenome acts as a kind of encryption layer switching genes on and off in order to change the way the instructions run. In other words, our DNA is heavily encrypted, but the same mechanisms also allow for the real-time adaptation to environmental conditions. This approach seems like it&#39;s more efficient then what&#39;s represented in this video. I&#39;m curious if this could be applied in computer science.

 8 bits per character was a relatively modern luxury when i was young.  Of course it started out with 5-bit encoding as used on punch paper tapes (no hole =0, hole=1). Giving 31 codes for letters and a serial shift code for numbers.<br>Then we got US ASCII which was 7-bit. Then extended ASCII/ANSI 8-bit, and then of course the modern day 16-bit Unicode.

 Uhm... Just a side-note: (readable) Letters and punctuation have just 7 bits - 128 characters.  In fact, there are just 94 of them - but 94 also takes 7 bits. character 0x00 - 0x20 are control-characters, which are eventually useful for formatting text, 0x80 - 0xFF are &quot;special characters&quot; (in ASCII) which you cannot &quot;read&quot; in the english language. So you can display a full text with 7 bits per character. <br><br>The rest is well explained.

 Great summary.<br><br>This method is also combined with LZ (&quot;repeat 6 characters starting 8 back from the one you just decoded&quot;) and RLE (&quot;repeat this character 5 times&quot;). As far as I know those plus Huffman are the fundamentals of every compression algorithm.

 Considering this is Binary, I wonder what we could achieve if we could accurately read/write halves, quarter, 1/8ths of a charge.  <br>Perhaps unlike quantum computers, with as much accuracy and speed of current hardware.  <br>Could we be even more sloppy with our implementation than the 8-bit encoding?

 wouldn&#39;t the theoretically best method be to use a tree that used, not just letters, but sequences longer than individual digits? such as 2-digits, or even whole words (Each of which would be followed by a space, essentially removing the need for the space to be in the huffman tree). such as the 200 most frequently used words in a novel + individual letters in order to assemble those that don&#39;t fall under the top 200? i&#39;m betting this is, indeed, how more advanced implementations of huffman&#39;s coding works.

Encoder and decoder read the letters in the same order, produce the same tree.

 I hate to nitpick, but ASCII characters are technically only 7 bits, which allows a parity bit.  Of course, my introduction to computing was on an IBM System/3, which is an EBCDIC machine, as was the Honeywell Level-62 we replaced it with.  It still seems like a space should be x40 instead of x20.  üòÑ.

Take for instance the increase in video compression when he talks about it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8&amp;t=0m43s">0:43</a>), him saying &quot;worms&quot; instead of &quot;words&quot; when talking about (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a>) lossy text compression, and the fact that at (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8&amp;t=4m40s">4:40</a>) he does his gestures mirrored so it is our left and right and not his left and right. On top of that he does it all in one take. I&#39;m always amazed when a new episode comes out.

 As I already commented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5c_RFKVkko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5c_RFKVkko</a><br><br>&quot;Huffman encoding is known as the best encoding with a fixed set of codes for the encoded alphabet. ... There is a better way to compress using the arithmetic coding. It does not generate a set of constant codes but is achieving a better compression rate.&quot;<br><br>It always makes me wonder why this is so rarely known. Over the top? Not fitting the basic nature of this video series? Huffman encoding is just a special case of arithmetic coding. <br><br>The only reason it wasn&#39;t used often was US patents on this algorithm. Today, they are expired, though. Some implementations of it may still have pending patents, but the general algorithm is patent free. Besides more modern algorithms are beating that with further ideas, as you already hinted on, so the algorithm being patent free has no big impact.<br><br>I know the interested viewer may read up on this in the wikipedia article about huffman coding, I would still categorize arithmetic coding to the basic algorithms and at least worth noting while explaining the huffman prefix codes.

 You said that this compression was the &quot;best mathematically on a single byte stream&quot;.....but I disagree.  There is a way that you can write a triple harmonic on a stream and xor those values to the data, the harmonic itself is very small to store in the tree.....you then do a full tree on what&#39;s left with a wrapping window enclosure for each character, reducing the tree when that character is not applied....and voila.  The harmonic can be altered to find the best fit window.<br><br>I know this technique requires a lot more processing on the compression side of the algorithm, but LZ compression is better than huffman on that anyway, so you&#39;d be wrong on that count as well.  This technique simply produces the smallest file possible given a minimum size across all types of compression.

 What if you compile a dictionary of common English words and assign a string of 1s and 0s to them instead of each letter individually? Basically treat the words like individual characters. Maybe have the most common words use less 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s and the more obscure words use more. I&#39;m guessing it wouldn&#39;t take up any more space than, say, Chinese, so I think it could work. Basically, cut out all the redundancy and unnecessary space taken up by the individual characters and just process each word as a single thing. Of course, this wouldn&#39;t work in situations where the letters matter, such as misspelled quotes, but the program could notice that a word is misspelled and isn&#39;t in the dictionary, then process each character instead.

 ASCII is actually 7bits not 8, it just happens that bytes are 8 bits in most modern systems so there is a wasted bit of storage. There have been plenty of 6bit char sets and systems that used 12bit bytes. Of course this 8th wasted bit of storage allowed UTF8 to be designed as a superset of existing ASCII. 

 	Replies: []

720: Psyklax 
 ROM hacker translators use dual tile encoding (DTE) or dictionary encoding, which both work the same way: not all of the 256 possibilities in a byte need to be used for text characters, so you use half of them for two-letter combos, or whole words with dictionary encoding. If the program sees a byte in a certain range, it consults a pre-made table. You could use two tables to compress even more, and it probably compresses even greater than this Huffman example.

 What if we... Search the lyrics for letters most commonly found together in pairs as well. Make a separate tree for those. Assign them a strand picking up where the last strand left off. And have their code replace the code of any two characters where those two character match something from this alternate tree and are of longer bit length then the combined character code on the alternate tree. would that work to compress it more?

741: therealquade 
 LZ Compression &gt; Huffman coding. compress repeat strings down to links back to their previous occurrence, it&#39;s more efficient as long as your link is smaller than the string, which typically happens at 3 character strings and longer. additionally word index/dictionaries are better for even larger files, such as books, where words can be stored as characters, which can then further be compressed again.

 So how much of a Huffman-compressed ASCII text file is the tree on average, for a given length of text? Presumably the tree itself should not be losslessly compressible (otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be the provably best compression for single-character blocks), and presumably the percentage of a 100-char file that the tree makes up will vary a bit between texts (aaaaaa being less diverse than qwerty).

 It is absolutely not the mathematical limit. It is optimal is probability are negative powers of two. For instance one character has probability 0,5 , and two others 0,25 then it is optimal. You&#39;d wonder, but then, if we break this limit, then we&#39;d have a non integer number of bits per character. is that even possible ? It was assumed no for a long time, hence the mentioned proof, but in fact it isn&#39;t so and we now know how to do it.<br><br>I suggest you look for Finite state entropy as one interesting techniques achieving this. It is used in the recent ZSTD compression standard.

 Funny enough I did come up with this compression technique independently , but I designed it as a compression algorithm for  lossless image compression, and I was able to even compress  &quot;non compressible &quot; images(image with random noise and every pixel being a unique color)  in a lossless way, however after working on that for awhile I just concluded that it was kind of pointless for images because the amount of computation power needed vs  amount of bits saved made it not worth it, but I am working on a video for my yt channel that <br>I will show using some of those ideas  how to convert between different bases in an easy way without math.
