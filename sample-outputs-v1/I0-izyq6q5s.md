 just  WOW... I am working in the Software industry for about 3+ years now and I almost forgot the basics of the boring ( that&#39;s how the teacher explained ..!) register which I hated during my grad classes... but OMG... It&#39;s fascinating how easily you just described a register for great understanding where it took so many boring unclear classes to know about these in grad classes.. wish every grad teacher were like you man.. keep up the good work..!

 Hey Sebastian. I know I&#39;m 2 years late to the party, but I just recently discovered this series of yours, and following along has been a blast! I&#39;m curious by nature and have always wanted to understand fundamentally how computers work, so upon discovering your videos and the simulation tool you&#39;ve made available, I knew I&#39;d struck gold. I&#39;ve sunk 10s of hours into grasping how each logic gate works and how stringing them together can eventually result in a functioning computer. I haven&#39;t even gotten to the later videos in this series, but I&#39;ve already learned so much that I want to thank you for doing all of this. You&#39;re amazing!

 The L1, L2, L3 cache is powered by an infinite circuit set up by capacitors under the Cpu. The processor (or the 387 coprocessor) remembers the dexterity, magic, strength, vitality, intelligence, agility, luck. Simple, an Itanium or Xeon processor fills its cache with such data. To erase the cache of the Pentium 2, use your finger. Engineers overcomplicate all these simple things, to mislead the public. Very sad.

 Ah...the second method, the SR NOR latch, was how I saved values in Minecraft in early redstone days, before repeaters and pistons. My tic-tac-toe masterpiece was built off of this simple circuit. I didn&#39;t know anything about logic, but with this schematic + an open sandbox + lots of free time...voila! Who says you can&#39;t learn playing video games :)

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s&amp;t=7m00s">7:00</a> also ask yourself the question of why does electricity only travel in a closed loop -/+? I guess it&#39;s because they are Bosons with a designated target: + so if there is no way to reach that it&#39;s superposition won&#39;t interact with the super-positions of other particles. A loop like that is what we would more or less expect if Quantum-physics wasn&#39;t a thing

 This could be vastly optimized especially from the D-Latch to the Flipflop to the 1 Bit registere as you call it.<br>All the functionality of the register can be done with less logic on the D Latch level. But I get that you did this for educational reasons to go from a to b to c and not cram to much into one thing.<br>Same goes for the ALU and some other stuff from the videos, however the videos are amazing and your voice is really nice clear and crisp

 Wow this would have been helpful <br><br>I randomly downloaded a circuit simulator that&#39;s basically this on my phone. <br><br>Without looking it up, I stumbled upon how binary works by using the displays. I then figured out how to add and subtract binary numbers by hand. <br><br>Then I decided to try and make a calculator in my simulator. <br><br>Then.... I made memory so that I can turn thst into a multiplication calculator <br><br>My last project was a 32 bit memory block which can be manually or automatically written to and read from lol <br><br>And again....... I just screwed around and drew logic diagrams until it all worked lol <br><br>These videos would have been GOLD lol

 Love the video. If you havent had the reason for the double nor gate working in real life its because the sim you use is assuming power comes from voltage and amperage but this is false.

 I love the videos in this series. I got the simulation, and it really helps me understand what you are saying even better, which is saying something because you explain everything extremely well. Just one quick suggestion for the sim: Make players able to delete chips, preferably by right-clicking, which would bring up a small button to delete. I made a 4 bit adder, but then realized if I was to ever use it in even bigger calculators, I would need to add a carry in input (something I neglected to do). Now I have two adder types, and the first one isn&#39;t worth having, but here I am.

 	Replies: ['BitwiseMobile', '@acertainnemesis SSDs store data using a flavor of flash memory technology.  Flash memory works by using a floating gate MOSFET.  MOSFETs are a complex topic on their own, but you can think of them as switches in this case.  They will be either off or on - 0 or 1.  Normally the switches need an input of power to change state, but the floating gate sort of &quot;holds&quot; the last state, so when you switch the power off it holds the switch in that state.  The gate is &quot;floating&quot; because it&#39;s completely isolated from everything else, so the charge can be retained for up to 10 years.  So flash is sort of like having an electrical switch, but when you turn it off a small force holds the switch into place for you until you turn it back on again.', 'acertainnemesis', '@Wyrmver Oh wow didnt know that.

 the video is awesome and all, but you are totally scrweed up the concept of D-Latch and D-flip-flop, and that&#39;s because you don&#39;t understand the difference between doing something when clock is high and doing something only and only on the rising edge of the clock. This video could have been so much better if you have correctly explained these concepts. There is a lot of confusion out there between D-latch and a flip-flop. But in general Latch is a term used to describe when a data element stored a value whenever clock is high however a flip-flop stores a value ONLY on the rising edge (could also be falling edge), older processors such as 6502 worked in the way you described with latch, so one latch before a combinatorial algorithm and another latch after (but with inverted clock) to control the flow of information in a state machine, however in case of flip-flops both latches can be connected to the same clock as they are only triggered the rising edge and that&#39;s how current processors and FPGAs etc work, Adding a clock pin to a latch (SR or JK) does not make it a flip flop -- it makes it a gated latch. In short a latch become tranparent for the whole duration when clock is high a flip-flop only change it&#39;s output at the risging edge of the clock

 i managed to make an actual clock, by taking a DLatch, inverting its output, and using that as its input (i give my latches a Out and Out Not to make this easier), then its store signal is just an enable pin for the clock, its quite fast by default, so you might want to add a few div2 circuits (these are actually the exact same circuit, with a d flip flop, instead of the d latch) before you output the clock signal, i found that the clock is approximately 8Hz. so 3 div2s should be enough

 Hi everyone. I want to advance my knowledge of logic gates and stuff. We all are taught computers (any kind of digital device/machine) only understand 0s and 1s. 0 refers to &#39;low&#39;, &#39;off&#39; or &#39;no&#39; while 1 refers to &#39;high&#39;, &#39;on&#39; or &#39;yes&#39;. So, let&#39;s take off and on: what does `Off AND On gives Off (false)` means? does this means we are providing two inputs to AND one has electricity while other don&#39;t or something else? 

 	Replies: ['Gohan Goku', 'Hello, this is a very good and important question. It shows that you have already entered the deeper levels mentally. \r<br>\r<br>You have to fundamentally distinguish between two things here: Once the physical level and once the logical level. \r<br>\r<br>In the physical level, the highs and lows are determined by voltage levels. Thereby &quot;no voltage&quot; can either be a zero, or depending on the logic or agreement a &quot;high&quot; (this is called active low). \r<br>\r<br>The first principle is easier to understand. There are transistors that open their current flow channel only when a sufficiently high voltage is applied to them. For active low applications, there are also transistors whose current flow channel is already open without an applied voltage and is only closed when a sufficiently high voltage is applied (negative principle). \r<br>\r<br>If we now build a circuit with these two types of transistors without having any power supply at all (there is no current flowing anywhere), we can form the basic gates by clever arrangement of these elements. Take two transistors of the same type and connect them in series -&gt; AND gate. If you connect them in parallel -&gt; OR Gate. With this method we can build the most complicated arithmetic units. So far so good. \r<br>\r<br>But this circuit is not able to perform an operation. It has a property, but it is not alive. Without power supply nothing happens here. If a memory function exists within the circuit, as shown in the video, the memories are lost as soon as the power supply is withdrawn from the entire logic, because there is no more current flow and all active highs are no longer active. This type of memory is called volatile memory. (like the ram in your PC).\r<br>\r<br>But now there are transistors that have such a control of their current flow channel that they can &quot;catch and keep&quot; electrons from the power supply. Depending on the amount taken up, the degree of opening of the channel differs. These types are called floating-gate transistors. These elements can also be used to build a circuit that does not lose its state even after the power supply is disconnected, because they still have &quot;trapped&quot; charges. These trapped charges shape themselves into certain voltage levels, which are then used to distinguish whether a cell connected together from several transistors is a &quot;high&quot; or a &quot;low&quot;. With clever circuitry, a mass storage device can thus be built, as is the case with your computer SSD, for example, the so-called NAND flash.', 'iloveyou', '@Wannabelokesh Ah, I see what you&#39;re saying now. This is also something I wondered when watching this series. I&#39;m assuming that there is still a flow of electricity to all gates. -- okay, I just googled it before I replied and this is what I found from stackoverflow: &quot;Logical gates are electronic circuits having their power supplies in addition to the logical IO.&quot; -- so basically, there is always a power source to the logic gates, and the logical computation is not dictated by the &quot;flow&quot; of electricity, but moreso the flow of the logic. Not sure the specificities of it but that&#39;s essentially what is happening.', 'Wannabelokesh', '@iloveyou I&#39;m not talking about the logic. I&#39;m talking about something else. The input and output. Is it current? if yes, how does Off NOT (!0) can give On (1) meaning how does no current can produce current? I&#39;m thinking all this noob thing because digital devices work on electricity and you know I can&#39;t explain it more deeply, please try to co-operate if you really want to understand the question and find an answer.', 'iloveyou', 'The AND logic gate requires BOTH inputs to be 1 for it to produce the output of 1.  all other conditions provide an output of 0']

So the faster you make that clock tick, the quicker it makes the rest on the breadboard calculate things?<br>I&#39;m new to this electronics stuff and just had an ahaaa moment!<br>So to overclock this little processor you would simply need to increase the tick rate on your clock?

 I have found that I do a lot of experimenting in the simulator before I find how to design the gate/chip I am trying to make. All too often I click on CREATE before I make a screen shot of how I made it work. I would like to be able to right-click on the name of the gates/chips I have created, and have a temporary window appear which shows me how I constructed that gate/chip. A second right-click could remove the temporary window. This would help me to not forget what I fought so hard to accomplish.

 I do like the video and if u could make more of this with that program, i would be happy to see and learn from it. <br>I started to play with the sim and now i made a fast pulse from the NAND and with the first 4 bit register u made, i made a little clock. <br>So i have a ON button for the clock, I also made a save store. <br>When i push the store button and put it off again, it knows it has to store the data. And the clock will turn the store in the system off when the store button is off, else when the store button is on it keeps storing, when u put the store button off, it keeps in the system the store on till the clock passes. It really helpt with the last part u ended with. the 4bit calculator.

 I have a computer engineering degree and 10 years of work experience but I find your videos so amazing that I find myself watching them even about things that I already know. BTW I was so fixated and hypnotized by the way you move the mouse cursor and how smoothly it&#39;s done that I had to backtrack a section of the video several times because I was only paying attention to the mouse hahaha you make it seem so effortless like &quot;I&#39;m recording my screen just moving the mouse and talking&quot; and I&#39;m not sure but I&#39;m under the impression the mouse is scripted or smoothed (great work! That&#39;s very hard to achieve and takes a lot of work and attention to detail). Anyway, your video is extremely easy to follow, and that&#39;s a huge and great thing because there is an immense amount of people trying to teach these concepts and yours has definitely stood out as the best, most beautiful, and easiest way to learn.

 I have a dream that the logic simulator is expanded upon as i have used it as a tool to basically learn computer logic from scratch for the last 6 months. Some quality of life additions would be amazing; being able to edit already saved chips, seeing which outputs from chips are one even though no lines are connected. And maybe even seeing a micro version of what¬¥s inside a chip when it¬¥s compiled. Anyway, thank you for making the tool and sharing it Sebastian :D

 For anyone interested, the random initial state is due to bounce. Any physical button or switch takes time to settle, basically flapping back and forth at very high frequencies before settling. Physical buttons and switches needs to be debounced and can be achieved with (from the button output) a R to VCC and a C to GND.

 latch and memory are separate, one is essentially powered, all the time, and the other is not powered, only when its operated on, memory consumes hugely less power than an active component memory

 In your construction of the NOR gate, there&#39;s a subtle subtext here about &quot;functional completeness&quot;.  Everything can be built using only NAND or NOR gates as your fundamental objects (that is, only NAND, only NOR, or, of course, some combination of them).  (To contrast that with your original building construction which required two logic gates, to wit: AND and NOT).<br><br>I look forward to part three of this series.<br><br>(I&#39;ve never taken an electronics course, but as a former math teacher, I suspect lots of students have had an assignment to make all the gates out of NAND and NOR thrown at them.)

Plate?<br>I thought it would be about hos the hard drive keeps the state of bits as 1 and 0 even when there is no current.<br> That&#39;s more an explanation of how they compute by keeping states temporarily in various memory types, in the cache, here, or rather directly in the CPU&#39;s logic gates I suppose. There is also the complexity of modern CPU&#39;s architectures and these logic gates.<br>Anyway, good video. Don&#39;t mind my ramblings.

We are so used to abstract thought we overlook the fact that computers are only a pattern of on off switches.

Computer was originally the job title for operators using electro mechanical machines.   Machine is the more accurate term for the device or apparatus .  I say this because the term computer confuses people and makes the think there is something magical.  The only magic is in the electro magnetism which is what the word magic actually comes from.

 How do computers remember?<br><br>The chips that make up a computer&#39;s internal memory come in two broad flavors known as RAM (random access memory) and ROM (read-only memory). RAM chips remember things only while a computer is powered on, so they&#39;re used for storing whatever a computer is working on in the very short term.

 Your circuit functions the same as a start/stop station to control an electric motor. L1 is fed to a stop buton throught to a start buton to cr1 which is fed to cr, when the start button is pressed, it provides power across the normally open cr1 contact to one side of the contactor relay that when energized all contacts change position our normally open contact that we bypassed with the start button is now a closed contact keeping current flowing to the relay. The stop botton being in line to that side of the relay when pressed stops current to the relay and turns it off thus our cr1 contact changes back to its normally open state. The other normally open contacts have power to one side and leads from the motor are on the other side, pressing the start switch turns our motor on while pressing the stop button turns it off..

 At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s&amp;t=6m43s">6:43</a> not only is there a gate delay like you said, but theres also energy lost from the wire since it has a nonzero resistance. This would also be a factor in why it eventually settles to a random node being active.<br><br>I learned something similar in my physics course where closing a circuit when there is a component that continuously flips the voltage will cause a decaying oscillation until all the energy is lost (i think it was an inductor in a loop with a switch to an external power source) <br><br>The time to decay depended on a damping coefficient in the formula

 Many thanks for your videos, please do upload more in this series! One question, I am really struggling to create an Or gate in your (frankly amazing) software. What combination of And / Not do I need? I think I have a solution but it prevents an &#39;And&#39; - an open OR/AND combination would be useful. Thank you!

 would be cool to see you continue this.  Also, good job on the simulator.  I just found out that logisim sortof lets you make custom chips by making subcircuits, but so for I like your simulator more.  I&#39;m thinking of implementing the NAND2Tetris computer in logisim now.

 Ive had courses where I was taught this in two different universities and BOTH times they failed to show the intuition and motivations for coming up with the different latches... I&#39;m just mind blown before minute 12. I know I&#39;m a bad student but if my professors took this approach instead of just pulling out schematic after schematic and only giving us enough words to appreciate their characteristic tables, maybe I&#39;d understand a bit better...<br>You are awesome and your attention to the beauty and detail in computer hardware is mesmerizing to say the least.

 I created a &#39;bit&#39; that works like a bistable button: give it a pulse and it outputs a constant signal, give it another one and it outputs nothing. How I made it:<br><br>Have 1 input and 1 output pin (on the edges). Place the following: a 1-bit register, a NOT gate and an OR gate. Connect the left bottom pin in the 1-bit reg. to the input pin. Then connect the output of the 1-bit reg. to the NOT and OR gates. Also connect the output of the NOT gate to the OR gate and output pin on the far right. Then, connect the output of the NOT gate to the top left pin of the 1-bit reg. Lastly, connect the output of the OR gate to the middle left pin of the 1-bit reg. Now it&#39;s done! Only took me like 3 minutes to figure out, even tough I know nothing about chips. Enjoy!<br><br>Edit: If you replace the OR gate (wich makes sure the &#39;STORE&#39; pin is always powered) With another input pin, you have what I like to call a control bit. By powering the second input, you can choose wether you want the bit to work or not.

 It&#39;d be excellent for the let&#39;s say,illiterate like me to see the innards.<br><br>Yet I&#39;m sure it&#39;s to cut out redundancies in his video. Although what I lack in information &amp; algebraic logic I make up for in all things editing. Photography,Video editing,Music/audio etc. is how much of my 36yrs of time has been spent. <br><br>That being said,to the channel operators I have a simple suggestion that will work for the viewers while also ensuring the narrator/host doesn&#39;t have to pause a lecture to show an expanded view.<br><br>With the exception of &#39;New&#39; chips created in the current video to be uploaded,all chips previously created but limited to specific components featured in video to be uploaded should have a clip of an expanded view so viewers can see how said chips were arranged and assembled.<br><br>However these expanded view clips would typically be placed either at the beginning or the end of the video,then take use of youtubes time-stamp &#39;linking&#39; feature. Either way as part of the introduction the host/narrator should inform the viewers that there are encoded timestamps so they can quicky skip back &amp; forth.<br><br>Sadly I don&#39;t see enough tubers taking full advantage of such a powerful feature. Giving your viewers the ability to skip to any portion of your video will definitely make people watch your videos more often. <br><br>Especially important for individuals like me who,if content is good enough, I&#39;ll return to this video as many times as needed while starting projects. Like a Build-a-Long video! <br><br>So to have a portion that showcases the guts of all chips used in said video would be a massive time saver!!!!

Even worked up an 8-bit shift register with override, so it can convert 1-bit serial data into an 8-bit out, and convert an 8-bit input into 1-bit serial out. Plus basic set-all and reset-all input lines, of course. Figured it out on my whiteboard then got it working in your sim tool. :)<br><br>Looking forward to your next video in this series!

 You should mention that this is a design choice. I may not always want my result to be stored in A. I might want to &quot;remember&quot; what was in A and B and do other calculations with A, B and the result of my addition for a 4th result. That result may go to another register or to memory or some other type of logic operation. That&#39;s where your commands come in to play. Remember all the button pressing in the simulation are really the commands that will be given. But that is jumping way ahead. Point is in designing your hardware logic think about the commands that you might want as well.

 Okay so this is kinda random and pardon me if it&#39;s later in the video but it just occurred to me and I don&#39;t want to forget: with the variation where it cycles between 1 and 0 but most likely favors one slightly because it&#39;s closer/easier to travel,,,, couldn&#39;t you just invert the chips basically every time you do it so that for instance it may favor 1 slightly but then the next time it favors 0 because there&#39;s a big ol&#39; not in the loop? Sounds like the only probable way to get absolute random in computers over pseudo random but Idk if that&#39;s just improbable to create like you&#39;d probably have two different chips and after the one is triggered it turns on the other and consequently turns itself off because of a xor gate or something

 Very cool video. I love the smooth animations. Maybe you could have included the T Flip Flop / Latches as they are interesting as well. The T stands for Toggle and when you pass a &quot;1&quot; signal into its input it will just toggle it&#39;s output from one state to another. (If it&#39;s &quot;ON&quot; it goes to &quot;OFF&quot; and vice-versa)

 I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re doing anymore game programming tutorials or not but I&#39;ve searched for a while on how to implement an Input buffer for something like a fighting game. I&#39;m not even sure if you covered something like this.<br>I found a couple of things but they don&#39;t make any sense and they don&#39;t go into detail on how it works.<br>Basically I&#39;m trying to achieve simultaneous buttons (ie A+B and so on) and button combos (ie QCF+P).<br><br>For the past few days I&#39;ve been switching between trying to find help on the topic that I can understand and experimenting with my own ways of pulling it off.<br>I&#39;m literally pulling my hair out over this. For now I&#39;ve decided to switch back to an older project.<br>If you can point me in the right direction for some help that would be fantastic.<br><br>And from the looks of it a few others need help understanding this as well.

 You said you&#39;re going to build RAM in the next episode...turns out that&#39;s actually quite simple. You just need to have a register for each address, and a multiplexer to select which one you want. So it&#39;s quite simple to build RAM out of the components you&#39;ve already built up.

 was wondering, for the problem of the race condition, could you bias one of the gates by adding a buffer from the output of that gate leading to the input of the other gate, meaning that when the circuit is powered up, the output of the circuit is always granted to be either a 0 or 1 depending which gate you biased, as apposed to it being random whether the output is 0 or 1?

Storage, which does hold data without power, can&#39;t be done purely through logic, it needs a physical way to store binary values. Hard disks do it with magnetic fields on a disk, SSDs basically just have very well-insulated cells that store voltage (it does leak out over time, and data can get lost if the ssd is left unpowered for an extended period of time). Once you&#39;ve got the data physically stored, it just needs to be run back into the machine on boot.']

I&#39;m not good enough to code something like that especially not know how you even did this if it&#39;s too much of an inconvenience could I possibly get some tips on how to do so?

 Small correction at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s&amp;t=7m14s">7:14</a>, real digital logic cells that can have this &quot;undetermined&quot; state must ALWAYS be forced into reset mode at startup. Thus we always force the output to be false. Depending on what this memory bit is used for, having an unknown state &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; could be dangerous and could break the computer if not careful.

 I love your videos. I have one suggestion though to improve the parse-ability of your simulations - when you have a component that stores values like the registers, and you load some value into one then rewire to something else - the little output dots should go red. Eg if a component stores a value and is constantly outputting it, its output dots should stay red, like the wires go red when they carry a value

 I downloaded the simulation tool and have been following your videos instructions and I&#39;ve learned so much,  and creating my own logic circuits easily is one of my dreams as a little kid, I still don&#39;t know exactly what is going on intuitively with some of the more complex circuits so I have some suggestions for it <br>- I would like to edit my chips, when messing around I often mess up the logic on my chips and they don&#39;t work. I either have to start over or use my dead chip in a new one to make it work and simply being able to go into the chip and change something would be appreciated. changing the name would be nice too.<br>- auto wiring, my finger hurts from clicking, it would be nice to just press shift to get a neat wire <br>- zooming in and out and the ability to change the size of the board as it gets crowded very quickly if I&#39;m working on something for more than 30 mins

In real life all electronic logic components have a separate connection to the power supply. The inputs do not supply power they just control whether the outputs allow the power to pass through or not.  Watch the 1st video where the NOT concept is shown (1.5 to 3 mins), when the switch (i.e. the input) is open the light will stay lit as long as power is available. Adding power connections to every component in the simulator would just add unnecessary details.']

 As a computer science student, I already studied this, however it is really cool to see this stuff again and much easier to understand.

 Love this tool! It&#39;s super useful. I&#39;ve got an idea you might want to implement: when creting more than one input/output it adds ‚Äãa decimal representation next to the inputs/outputs, however the number represented is always positive. How about adding the possibility of it being negative without having to have an extra bit to represent its sign? The numbers for 4 bits would be as follows, and I am sure you can deduce how it would be for a bigger o smaller number of bits.<br><br>‚ÄãBINARY	DECIMAL<br>‚Äã0000	‚Äã0<br>‚Äã0001	‚Äã1<br>‚Äã0010	‚Äã2<br>‚Äã0011	‚Äã3<br>‚Äã0100	‚Äã4<br>‚Äã0101	‚Äã5<br>‚Äã0110	‚Äã6<br>‚Äã0111	‚Äã7<br>‚Äã1000	‚Äã-8<br>‚Äã1001	‚Äã-7<br>‚Äã1010	‚Äã-6<br>‚Äã1011	‚Äã-5<br>‚Äã1100	‚Äã-4<br>‚Äã1101	‚Äã-3<br>‚Äã1110	‚Äã-2<br>‚Äã1111	‚Äã-1<br>I think it would be a great improvement because with this system you don&#39;t have to create special units to work with negative numbers, instead you only have to rethink the way you read the numbers.<br><br>Once again, amazing tool, and thanks so much!

 I would love to see a kind of &#39;expanded view&#39; added to the simulation program, which unwraps each chip into its core components recursively. I think that would be immensely satisfying to see, as well as a little hard to understand what is happening

Although what I lack in information &amp; algebraic logic I make up for in all things editing. Photography,Video editing,Music/audio etc. is how much of my 36yrs of time has been spent. <br><br>That being said,to the channel operators I have a simple suggestion that will work for the viewers while also ensuring the narrator/host doesn&#39;t have to pause a lecture to show an expanded view.<br><br>With the exception of &#39;New&#39; chips created in the current video to be uploaded,all chips previously created but limited to specific components featured in video to be uploaded should have a clip of an expanded view so viewers can see how said chips were arranged and assembled.<br><br>However these expanded view clips would typically be placed either at the beginning or the end of the video,then take use of youtubes time-stamp &#39;linking&#39; feature. Either way as part of the introduction the host/narrator should inform the viewers that there are encoded timestamps so they can quicky skip back &amp; forth.<br><br>Sadly I don&#39;t see enough tubers taking full advantage of such a powerful feature. Giving your viewers the ability to skip to any portion of your video will definitely make people watch your videos more often. <br><br>Especially important for individuals like me who,if content is good enough, I&#39;ll return to this video as many times as needed while starting projects.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s&amp;t=12m54s">12:54</a> Synchronous logic controlled by a clock signal can also help prevent invalid data from being stored in memory (i.e. the ALU doesnt calculate everything, THEN push all that to its output. It&#39;s output may change to multiple invalid states while its calculating, but by only reading its output on a clock edge, assuming the clock is longer than the ALUs time to calculate, then you should only ever read valid output from it. A DFF is a good choice for this use-case (they&#39;re also good for state generators))

 I&#39;ve downloaded the tool to try this out myself (thanks for sharing!), but it seems that the version that you&#39;ve made available, as well as the version on Github, has less features than you show in the video. The things I&#39;ve noticed are: no 2-complement notation, the numbers on the output don&#39;t show at all, and the names of the signals do not display. On top of that, I noticed a couple of graphical things that were slightly different. Could these changes be pushed as well, or should I implement them myself? ;)

 The moment i saw memory in the title, The microprocessor subject from my engineering course rushed through my mind and i immediately wondered if you included the infamous race condition and what happens when the power turns on when both the NOR gates are off in SR latch.<br><br>Also i think you should have also included what happens if both the set and reset are HIGH at the same time. 

 	Replies: ['Roxor128', '@Rutvik Panchal  I ran into that in a game of Factorio while trying to implement a combinator circuit to disable a train station for an oil patch that didn&#39;t produce much and avoid sending the oil train off on the long route to it when there wasn&#39;t enough available to make the trip worthwhile. I eventually got it working properly, but not without partially dismantling things to get it into a stable state. I think it got into the glitched state when setting up the combinators that provided the set and reset signals.', 'Rutvik Panchal', '@Sheep Undefined in that case both the outputs Q and Q&#39; will go LOW (using uppercase due to typing convention for bit states) which shouldn&#39;t happen in terms of logical properties we have assigned to the outputs.<br><br>As the Q&#39; is the opposite of Q both being the same value breaks the logic hence that state is considered an invalid state where the output of the latch isn&#39;t considered. In real world this never really happens because logically only one input of S or R is allowed to either SET or RESET the latch.<br><br>You can map how both the outputs go LOW using a pen and a paper, start with any one input and you&#39;ll slowly see how the outputs go LOW. You can also map this just by looking at the latch but it might be difficult to track. For reference you can check out SR Latch video by Ben Eater. His entire series of 8-bit breadboard computer is a goldmine of knowledge and i am genuinely amazed by the effort he puts in all of his videos to educate people all around the world for free (Think about it, cutting out wires to exact size necessary to provide crystal clear presentation of circuits!). His youtube channel has taught me more than my college on that subject. Same goes for many many creators on YouTube, @Sebastian Lague obviously being one of them.', 'Sheep Undefined', 'Uh, I&#39;ll bite! What would happen in that last case?']

 Thank you for this! You inspired me to make a binary calculator in Minecraft. I‚Äôm only in secondary school so I‚Äôm no expert but I worked out how to make different logic gates and put them together to make your adder circuit. I‚Äôm going to make a YouTube video on it when I finish it but at the moment I only have managed to figure out how to make an adder.<br>I‚Äôm trying to do it tutorial free but I‚Äôm using your logic gate maker thing to help me know the order üëç

 but your ram chips are actually a transiter + capacitor these days... the registers inside the CPU might still use latches, but your RAM actually has to be refreshed constantly so it doesn&#39;t forget.
