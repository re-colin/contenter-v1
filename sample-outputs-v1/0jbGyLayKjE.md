 When all stories come from or are at the very least mediated by corporations, who is to say whether they say anything meaningful about us at all? I love the channel, no dig intended here... but there is always the risk of seeing social relevance in material that is self-referential... and as you kinda of actually suggest, maybe this is not a lot more than capitalists making capital by capitalizing on capitalism. <br><br>I watch Boba Fett with my kid, and see frankly a sad thirst for meaning in what has somehow become our folklore. Who am us, anyways, at long last?

 Roald Dahl lost his daughter to measles years prior to writing Willy Wonka. He had a bad experience with the pastor which made him question all faith and religion. This book was about that. Later on when he wrote The BFG it was a more honorable tribute to his daughter.

 I want to write a version of this where Wonka and Charlie&#39;s grandpa are as they are, but Charlie, good kid that he is, becomes corrupted by the temptations in the factory. Food everywhere when he&#39;s starving, money laying around when he&#39;s poor (golden eggs), and more.

 I like your video. Thank you for sharing your thoughts of Willy Wonka. Charlie and the chocolate factory is one of my favorite Roald Dahl stories. I remember when I was a kid at Woodlands Elementary School in 5th Grade my teacher Mrs. Molly read the book to not only me but to all of the students in her class. Around the same time we did a class project where we made a float for the story book parade and we have to draw some pictures of different scenes from the book. Then one year later in 2009 when I was in 6th Grade I did a school play where my principal Mr. McCormick played Grandpa Joe and I was the giant Wonka Bar passing out the programs and operating the curtains. Fast forward to 2019 I saw the stage show. It started in London&#39;s West End in 2013 and it&#39;s still running on Broadway. Now the national tour has landed in Seattle&#39;s Paramount Theatre. I like the show and it is a blend of both of the 1971 Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory movie and the 2005 Charlie and the chocolate factory movie but there is one complaint of what I don&#39;t like about the show is they used adult actors to play Augustus, Verruca, Violet and Mike. Which makes the show look kind of weird because adults don&#39;t act like nasty kids. A lot of audiences who saw the show on Broadway and on tour in the U.S. are never going to notice that but for me that really bugs me because when I saw School Of Rock and Matilda The Musical when they were on tour in the U.S. they had child actors on stage. Out of all of the performances of Charlie and the chocolate factory live on stage I like the London&#39;s West End version a lot better because they have the child actors to play Augustus, Verruca, Violet and Mike which makes more since because we need kids to act like nasty kids. Plus when the show started in London they know what they were doing for the casting of child actors in the show to play the four nasty kids and they got it right. Compare to the Broadway and National Tour versions they used adult actors to play Augustus, Verruca, Violet and Mike which doesn&#39;t make any since and they got the casting of the characters in the show wrong. But still I want child actors in the show to play the four nasty kids. Every time they do a stage play of Charlie and the chocolate factory in America after the success of the West End version the Broadway/National Tour and UK Tour versions always get&#39;s the show wrong. <br><br>The Broadway and U.S. Tour versions of Charlie and the chocolate factory needs to pay attention more on the West End version and do more research on their auditioning process for child actors to be in the show because Broadway is being so lazy when it comes to casting to play the characters in the show. The show did great on Broadway and on tour in the U.S. it&#39;s just it wasn&#39;t the right casting. Other than that another con about the show is that it had no exit song for Violet after she chewed the three cores dinner chewing gum and the show is going from kid friendly to dark when during the Nutcracker Suite the squirrels tore Verruca apart. I&#39;m going to give the Broadway and National Tour version of Charlie and the chocolate factory a 7 out of 10 with the exception of the adult actors playing the four nasty kids, making the show dark, no exit song for Violet and the squirrels taring Verruca apart.  When the show is back on Broadway and back on tour in the U.S. I hope they will correct this in the future and allow child actors on Broadway and National Tour to play Augustus, Verruca, Violet and Mike in Charlie and the chocolate factory. They also need to make the show less dark, more kid friendly and make it a little more like the West End version and the 1971 and 2005 films.<br><br>Not only that, if the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle or any other Theatre in the United States and the United Kingdom want to recreate their own stage production of Charlie and the chocolate factory and make it a better version and get a revival on Broadway and on tour in the UK and USA then they not only they need to include child actors to play Augustus, Verruca, Violet, Mike and Charlie but here are the songs they should use for act 1 and act 2 from the West End version, Broadway version, stage school/community theatre productions of Willy Wonka and one song I made up for the Nut Room scene.<br><br>Act 1:<br><br>1.

 Obviously racial issues abound but I always saw this as a satirical condemnation of capitalism. For example, it‚Äôs taken to absurd extents how Wonka ‚Äúimports‚Äù people and how much the unemployed townsfolk revere him. It‚Äôs not unlike Elon‚Äôs Twitter army. <br><br>I‚Äôm probably wrong, though but it seems like a possible way of interpreting it.<br><br>Also, the author definitely had a chip on his shoulder about kids.

 I saw the old movie in TV when I was little, and it got stuck to my brain forever, in a bad way. What a weird and awful thing.<br><br>There&#39;s a point I don&#39;t agree.<br>It&#39;s all good understanding the structural part from where problems arise. Same goes for any social problem, police brutality. crime, racism, corruption... But let&#39;s not erase the individual responsibilities when doing so.<br><br>Maybe Charly, when he gets the factory (sorry for spoilers :P), can&#39;t solve things single-handedly, because the problems are systemic, sure. But he could make things less bad, or at least not worse, or even not participate in exploitation at all, and leave the factory in control of the Oompa Loompas. He can choose how to participate inside that system.<br>Capitalist exploitative pigs should still be accountable for the damage they do, and it doesn&#39;t matter if they come from poverty, or are put in that role by some external pressure.

 i&#39;m only about halfway through so far, but it&#39;s really an incredible video, you&#39;ve done an outstanding job! i always felt a little bit affronted about the fate of the kids in the book, especially given like... the circumstances? what they&#39;re there for? violet and augustus are punished for loving candy, inside a candy factory. veruca is rich and spoiled, but like... the kids are still in the single digits. that&#39;s absolutely more an indictment of her parents than of her. and mike is just a smart kid! he&#39;s just punished for speaking out of place! idk how to describe it, but to me there&#39;s this real sense of entitlement/deservedness that runs through the book that - while i love it - always put me off a bit. and the way you&#39;ve framed it in a religious angle is really enlightening, i think!

 This video is amazing. Educational, yet eerily creepy. No music, no happy title card, just a girl and a bookshelf telling a story. The same story, but from 3 points a view- making the character of ‚ÄúWilly Wonka‚Äù come to be all the more of our friend. But not really, as he‚Äôs a wicked, fast talking little imp, who can turn on a dime. This video perfectly shows what Dahl was trying to accomplish with this character. One of the most iconic literary characters held under a microscope- examined for a new era.

 Hey Zoe, I&#39;d really like to see an expose on cartoon billionaires.  I think cartoons imbued with the same thing may have been even more ubiquitous because it  was accessible to those of the lowest incomes.   This caused me to think about who was the target audience of the original.  I don&#39;t believe it was those of the lowest incomes so.......then this could be kind of a &quot;cremation of care&quot; for those of the middle and  upper incomes.        However, cartoons were accessible to those of the lowest incomes.    The focus of what they were imbued with ,something perhaps even more vile,  that an &quot;Oompa Loompa &quot; would always be an &quot;Oompa Loompa,&quot;  contentment to be part of the  permanent underclass.

 The whole point of the story was to teach kids to take some responsibility for their behavior. To be humble, healthy and virtuous. Nothing more, nothing less. C&#39;mon.

 I never really thought of Willy Wonka as an awful guy when I was a young child and was just happy that Charlie could escape from poverty, but recently, I rewatched both movies with my friend and sister. While watching, I noticed how messed up it was for Willy Wonka to manipulate and injure children, the fact that he enslaved the oompa loompas, and as my sister pointed out, how he plans to groom a child into running a business exactly as he wants so that he will essentially be controlling the company even after his death. Thanks to this video, I now have a much more... complex view of the story

 Not read book but I found the characterisation in the gene wilder version quite unlikeable. The depp version I had to take my friends children to see at the time reminded me of Michael Jackson and his weird ways. I thought the business capitalist message was quite obvious. I found both film versions disturbing. As for Sacking his workers, where was the union and the picket lines? As for the parallel with the Christian god it works exactly not a darker parody bad the Christian god is a jealous god one that causes suffering to the innocent and denies daily bread when it suits his purposes, so the wonka parallel works directly. And the bible conveys the fear of god that humans could become like him in a number of places, which is why steps are taken to prevent this from happening. The name of one of the children, Augustus, is probably coincidence, but 2,000 years ago if you were talking about the saviour of mankind, bringing good tidings to the world and making all war to cease you would have been talking about the emperor Augustus, characteristics later transferred to Jesus Christ, the personification of Jesus has literally been transferred from Augustus so in that sense Jesus has usurped Augustus technically the true redeemer, so is willy wonka as the metaphor for Jesus, as he is portrayed by the church, symbolically trying to eliminate the original saviour, Augustus?

 Very interesting interpretation of Willy Wonka! I recently watched The Theorizer&#39;s latest video on him, and it&#39;s eerie how related both interpretations are. He uses a lot more evidence from Tim Burton&#39;s movie, but nonetheless its interesting. He further posits that the Oompah Loompas are indeed creations of Wonka himself, placed in one of numerous artificial biomes Wonka has proven himself capable of creating. He then goes down, fully capable of communicating with them already, and offers them divine bounties in the form of the cacao bean, something that they just so happen to already worship. It&#39;s as if Wonka indeed played god, not only creating life, but shaping the very culture and civilization that they organize themselves in.

What if he lived a few states away and his family couldn&#39;t afford a flight for them? Would Wonka just shrug his shoulders and try again? Would one of the rich kids win? Who knows.

 I admit, when I saw the title, I was like, &quot;Oh, great, another Liberal Arts major whining about capitalism&quot;, but then I saw the video and you make some pretty good points. Capitalism, in and of itself, isn&#39;t a bad thing. Ideally, it means you get to keep the majority of the fruits of your labor. Everybody has the chance to become the next Sam Walton, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or John Rockefeller. However, it&#39;s only a razor&#39;s edge between capitalism and corporatism. In a corporatists society, wealth is only for the select few, the old money, and everybody else is under their boots, but still, there is a chance for financial growth. It is a highly-flawed and even cutthroat system, but I think it&#39;s better than the alternative.

Was that the movie I remembered? I forgot about it, but growing up, starting to understand better why I felt that way. But I felt alone. Nobody around me was seeing any issue with the way the kids were treated or expcted to behave. Or that the kids are punished for being selfish even though Charlie bought chocolate instead of food for his starving family.

 I love all forms and adaptations of this book. But as someone who&#39;s from the Philippines, country with large history of colonisation and slavery, I remember feeling weirdly about Wonka just bringing in indigenous people and making them &quot;workers&quot;. I always viewed the book as a slight child&#39;s beginner guide (I read this book when I was in 4th grade) to understanding the different classes like how Charlie is in poverty and Augustus (in the book at least) and Veruca are all part of a higher class. Then Wonka represents the working class, and Violet and Mike are the upper middle class.

 I&#39;ve only watched the original movie, so correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but aren&#39;t the Oompa Loompas willing employees? Not slaves? It&#39;s just a silly fantasy kids movie who&#39;s moral is basically &quot;don&#39;t be stupid and greedy.&quot; Sounds pretty morally sound to me. I don&#39;t think Willy Wonka has to do with capitalism vs communism at all, and even if it was pro-capitalist slavery isn&#39;t capitalism. Capitalism is all about competition and the free market. Slavery is easy labor but it also creates stasis in the economy. There has to be a constant flow of money for capitalism to work, and the reason capitalism is failing right now is because megacorperations have too much power and billionaires are hoarding all their insane wealth instead of dividing it fairly among their employees, paying then pocket change instead of an actual share of their insane income. If anything Willy Wonka is against late stage capitalism due to it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t be greedy&quot; message. Honestly the best corse of action is to put more government pressure onto megacorps and billionaires to disassemble and be forced to give out fair wages to combat inflation. Destroying the free market, giving everyone the same income, destroying all sense of competition and motivation in the workforce, and giving complete economical and job market control to the government (which is what communism is) is not the way to go about fixing the economy. Why do people like you like to make everything about communism? Not everything is capitalist or communist. You breadtube &quot;political analysists&quot; need to stop making everything about your ideology and just enjoy media for what it is. Critisism is fine, but you people go too far.

The right just spams out dozens of the same video of a manchild crying that they drew Luke Skywalker too feminine in a frame of a random Star Wars comic or that some mainsteamer actor made a cringe tweet or something. Both are bad, but I tend to always find the right wing ones a lot more annoying. Not to say the left wing ones are good, they&#39;re not.

 Seeing the awful products of capitalism (the greedy, overachieving, cheating, spoilt and entertainment addicted children) get it in the neck is enjoyable; I&#39;m not sentimental about children. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a bad person for getting schadenfreude out of the downfall of mike teevee. i was bullied by people like mike teevee so mike teevee can be deformed for life for all i care. still charlie bucket&#39;s obedience and docility is annoying. it would be lovely to see charlie and his grandparents mount an underclass revolution and negotiate with the oompa loompas as to whether they would like to start a workers cooperative or return to their home with reparations. at least charlie&#39;s father might get to be happy.

 As someone who has read the books and never saw Wonka as a hero, this speaks to me. I&#39;m using him as a Character in a roleplaying game I am writing, he will soon be introduced and my plan with him (as non of my players expect who know he is coming and just think &quot;nice candy&quot;) he will probably bring a big power imbalanced to the game, which is currently under the rule of trans icon Ozma of Oz. As an example he will peopbably argue that one of the biggest businesses in town is actually his as it was created by an Oompa Loompa who he sees as his property. In many ways he will insert his capitalistic views into the happy society my players have created and I hope that will cause some great conflict. <br>However the part where you mention &quot;Immortality Technology was still far away&quot; makes me wonder at the part in the second book where that actually comes up. He seems to have the trechnology but be against using it.

 I dunno, in the book Charlie is literally starving when he finds a dollar (as you yourself point out) but he doesn&#39;t spend it all on himself out of greed (as you say several times). He buys two chocolate bars (at ten cents each) and plans to bring the rest back to share with his family. It seems pretty harsh to fault a starving 9 year old as greedy and being the perfect consumer for immediately buying some food when he gets some money. That&#39;s even worse than condemning the other kids for being spoiled, actually.<br>Generally great, thought-provoking, and even disturbing video, though! (It was just this one part that seemed unfair.) The part about colonialism and slavery being invisible in this book hits especially hard. Roald Dahl&#39;s book were such a delightful part of my childhood, I&#39;m almost afraid to bring this lens to his other books too! Ironically I&#39;ve never bothered to watch any movie based on his books, for fear they might ruin my happy childhood memories.

 I have loved Willy Wonka since childhood, and I have found it impossible to watch/read the story and not be struck by one or more of the ideas discussed in this video. For me, this juxtaposition and dissonance between the different facets of Wonka&#39;s character is what makes the story so compelling, and I can&#39;t help but wonder if Dahl intended for the story to be deconstructed in this way.

 The musical theatre piece Hadestown is what I thought of in that description of Wonka the God. <br><br>The industrialism hiding below the surface of the earth, the poor protagonists struggling against the wealthy god, the way the workers sign their souls away, how a wall is built to keep the workers in their place, the figure of the dark god of greed, capitalism, industrialisation, and money. The main difference, I think, is that Hadestown is anti capitalist as a piece of media. <br><br>(Lady Persephone is interesting though, she‚Äôs King Hades‚Äôs wife, just as godly and powerful as he is, and is absolutely horrified at his treatment of the workers, his greed and desire for money and power, his turning Hell into a ‚Äúneon necropolis‚Äù King Hades is also a sympathetic character to an extent. He built Hadestown because he missed Lady Persephone during her time on the surface, he turned to industry to fill that loneliness, and he also thought that he could impress her with his ‚Äúelectric city‚Äù) <br><br>‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no difference between Hell and Hadestown any more‚Äù

 While there are definitely a lot of subtle allusions &amp; analogies to rampant systemic bad ethics and the 1971 movie adaptation with Gene Wilder intended to keep the allusion language on a high level for thoughtful adults, it seems to me there were also real tangible virtues espoused as well through Charlie&#39;s behavior, <i>NOT</i> that he was a &#39;good submissive consumer&#39; as Zoe or others might describe him, but that he observed the consequent negative results of the other&#39;s destructive behaviors, and then still, in the end when no one was really looking and by all accounts he could likely get away with selling the sample gobstopper and reaping a monetary reward, he chose the much harder path of truthful integrity.   While &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; was not published until 1973, I can&#39;t help but think that other such thoughtful authors &amp; producers in the arts were looking at what had been going on in other parts of the world with the rise of destructive communist regimes and like Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn, they concluded that against all these entrenched &amp; potential systemic injustices, the only practical defense is the next generation of people growing up with a commitment to integrity &amp; telling the truth - even if it might mean <i>not</i> getting a paycheck, that generation being represented by Charlie holding onto integrity.<br><br>I thought this reexamination of the first movie production was also interesting: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLJB_H21nVM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLJB_H21nVM</a>

 Most of those carbon programs are scams anyway.  Most of these programs also are usually filled with CGI have very little data very little actual scientific studies or evidence or real hard tested evidence of what they&#39;re doing would actually work as well as often missing a lot of very important crucial information cost analysis and the carbon requirements of what they would be doing and as well as other environmental impacts that could be related.<br><br>Essentially it&#39;s like all these idiots that drive around on electric cars it&#39;s like you have giant environment polluting lithium batteries okay so maybe you know the world&#39;s not going to heat up but good luck when you have no drinking water because there&#39;s so much lithium in it not to mention the fact of how unsafe these vehicles really are especially when you&#39;re taking to consideration how there is the allegations that safety inspectors were bribed to pass them regardless of the fact that they don&#39;t really pass fire standards and crashes due to you know lithium in fire. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong I mean I&#39;m all for preserving the environment and everything but you can&#39;t just save the environment by doing things that make you feel good they actually have to be thoroughly vetted and proven to work and work well it&#39;s like the problem with nuclear fusion isn&#39;t so much as we can t do it as we can&#39;t do it without putting more energy into it than can come out of it but as well even in liberal areas like New York they shut down nuclear power plants which produce a lot of green energy and to bounce back to the point of those electric cars all that electricity has to come from somewhere which will probably nuclear power plant since standard solar and wind could not produce the energy demands required for electric cars and the reality is the answer to car travel is in fact not more cars but to rather create cities and towns and places where people live where they do not require the need for cars where cars are in fact more cumbersome and less desirable because it is more convenient to either walk or hop on a trolley or public transit for 2 seconds to either get to work the grocery store or wherever you&#39;re going essentially communities and cities that are made for people and pedestrians as opposed to the wealthy elites that own vehicles and can be chauffeured around in said vehicles then that helps with the issue of vehicle traffic that helps with the issue of energy that helps with the issue of oil and it would greatly limit down how much is being used to transport things such as food or goods.<br><br>Now I know it&#39;s crazy get rid of cars but we all love driving cars well we can always build a racetrack and whoever wants to just go out and have some fun on the racetrack and do so sure people would still be burning through gas or whatever but it would still significantly cut down on the amount of gas that would be used the amount of cars that would be needed and people would still be able to have their fun should they seek it

 The thing this movie never showed is that out of every &quot;one poor good boy&quot; Charlie, there are a million who will not only NOT get the golden ticket, but will probably die of starvation and/or other issues that come with poverty. I actually don&#39;t shame or blame Charlie for being &quot;personality-&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot;-less; as a poor kid who was desperate to save his family, he saw this as his only way out of poverty. Who knows what would have happened if he defied Wonka completely? He might have decimated their little home, for all we know. For similar reasons why it&#39;s hard for the down-trodden ppl in this world to speak up. We shouldn&#39;t shame them for &quot;not having enough of a personality&quot;; they&#39;re trying to survive. Is it moral? No. Is it a question of survival? Definitely. At the same time, we should hope Charlie has enough smarts to not continue the cycle of trauma and is enough of a risk-taker to end the system of slavery and switch his manufacturing to an ethical system. Hopefully, the kid will wake up one day. Or who knows? He may be a bit manipulative himself and faked his sympathy for Wonka, and may in fact turn against him when he gets to his rebellious teen phase ;)

 I&#39;ve only watched the 2005 movie. Mainly because i was a toddler when it came out so I just grew up watching it and because im not form an English speaking country so the books and musicals aren&#39;t as popular or even available here. This being said, I distinctly remember watching this movie thousands of times, and every single time i remember being completely befuddled by the end. Like i just noticed how from the very beginning of the film wonka didn&#39;t like poor people, (i didn&#39;t notice his dislike of family, just how put off he looked  when noticing Charlie) and how Charlie&#39;s grandpa absolutely adored this man, and he in turn treated him horribly. Like i just remember how shocking it was to see how after that, Charlie just forgave everything just because wonka, a full grown man, had unresolved issues with his father.

Which really reinforces that Charlie wins because he will never stand up to wonka and if he did he would be condemning his whole family to starvation basically']

 God thank you THANK YOU THANK YOU ZOE. Speaking as someone who, as a child, was obnoxious about proselytizing, could be a bit of a bully (a learned behaviour from being severely bullied when I was in early elementary), and grew into a virulent homophobe and horrible edgelord until I got some sense knocked into me by real life, I really appreciated your addressing here that children *are not primarily responsible for their own suck*. <br><br>It is really hard, as a parent, to balance with my kids that their peers are not fully or even mostly (for my first-grader) responsible for the ways that they suck; they are products of their environments. That does NOT make it my kids&#39; problem that these kids are bullies or bigoted or what have you, though--the kids need to be socialized by having their peers correct them and even ostracize them if they won&#39;t stop behaving in ways that hurt other people. <br><br>But I&#39;m not going to get mad at other people&#39;s kids for being horrible, generally speaking. I&#39;m going to start looking at their parents and seeing where they learned it, and try giving grace and help where I can. (Again, not my kids&#39; job, but something I enjoy when I get to interact with other people&#39;s kids. They&#39;re complicated little people and they respond well to kindness more often than not.)<br><br>and like maybe prepubescent children don&#39;t deserve being brutally mutilated and murdered for being kind of crappy, but I hope that&#39;s implied

 charlie kinda reminds me of the nietzschean idea about &quot;slave morality&quot; which nietzsche saw best represented in medieval christianity.<br>it&#39;s &quot;the meek shall inherit the earth&quot; belief. the idea of wealth, health, happiness and power being equal to good or nobility, which we see in antiquity, has been replaced in the medieval times by the view of the poor, suffering, pious and modest person as noble and worthy of good things. as long as you patiently endure suffering on earth, the church told you, you can get your reward in heaven. and all those rich and powerful people? well, there&#39;s no need to get angry at them or try to overthrow them - they will end up in hell anyways. also being wrathful is a sin so you better don&#39;t do that.<br>and this is a comforting tale so that &quot;worthy&quot; victims can feel good about themselves and conform to the system that oppresses them. finding beauty and virtue in one&#39;s own oppression - now this is really a scary thing.

 Thank you for wwc4k And welcome back. How&#39;s your cat?<br>I saw the movie but not as deeply as your UT explores it. <br><br>I was granted US patent 3890161 DIODE ARRAY¬† for a refrigerator that absorbs thermal energy and releases a corresponding amount of electrical energy. I would prefer using a public idea registry that did not confer exclusionary power. The invention is a repudiation of the second law of thermodynamics which is part of science which ideally requires wide and open public participation. I have weak experimental evidence that the invention works and other teams have experiments that work. <br><br>Beyond equipment and maintence cost, this is free energy where energy can change form and even return to its original form without gain or loss. Electricity is made by borrowing heat from ambient air or water. Most uses of electricity return the thermal energy loan promptly. Refrigeration would produce electricity s ejectricity which would be contributed to a network or, for portable refrigerators, the electricity would be turned into heat,¬† which would be dumped into the air. <br><br>Please consider a thought experiment for self powered¬†thermal diversification that is impractical but easy to visualize and check for mechanical workability. <br>Sketch made with keyboard characters: <br><br>COLD ROOM¬†¬† ())--:::WALL:::--&gt;&gt; HOT ROOM¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<br>&gt;~1000 NM&lt; <br><br>Key<br>()) = Paddlewheel.¬†<br>-- = Axle.¬† (Continuous from end to end)<br>:::¬† = Axle tunnel going through a wall.<br>&gt;&gt; =¬† Lumped friction element<br><br><br>Visualize two roome full of air separated by a very thin wall that allows the rooms to hold their heat independently with minor leakage through the wall. The wall is thin to delicately support billions of¬† separate nanometer scale short axles running straight through loosely enough to rotate freely but¬† not leak very much heat so the rooms can hold separate temperatures. <br><br>On the left side, a very small paddlewheel is mounted at the left end of each axle. On the right side,¬†lumped friction elements are¬†mounted stationary in place on the wall, one for each axle, for the right end of each axle to run through. The lumped friction elements connvert the mechanical rotation of their axle into heat. <br><br>Brownian motion turns the paddlewheels at random speeds¬† randomly clockwise or rcounterclockwise. This random rotation is turned into heat by the lumped friction elements.¬† The lumped friction elements do not impart Brownian motion to their axle.¬†¬† <br><br>¬† The committed functional roles of the paddiewheels, axles, and lumped friction elements in differnt places should systemically produce a divergence in the thermal energy in the two rooms. The important point is that heat is moved by a nanometer scale process without being forced by added energy. This clears away the second law of thermodynamics. <br><br>An improved successor named Thermic Array needs protyping by a smoothly functioning nanofabrication team to see if it works. <br><br>The Thermic Array¬†mainly consists of two electrodes closely face to face (~1 micrometer) in a vacuum wired to an external electrical circuit. The face of the [Emitter] electrode is covered with a uniform array of LaB6 tipped small diameter carbon nanotubes grown straight out. The face of the [Absorber] electrode is covered with small scale graphine flake char. <br><br>Thermal energy mobilized unattached electrons tend to free themselves outward from the emitter tips and drift at ~1 million meters / second @ electron energy of 25 millivolts to the absorber which tends to collect them.¬† <br><br>A negative charge accumulates on the absorber. This repels oncoming electrons slowing their forward drift, cooling them. The absorber electrode charge is simultaneously the repelling cooling and the electrical circuit voltage. The drift current and wire current are the same. The DC electrical power consumed by the electrical load depends on the load resistance. Thermal energy absorption always equals the electrical yield. Wire resistance is a practical loss not a true loss. The performance of the device is expected to be modest in the beginning but improve rapidly. Even early devices are expected to last a long time.¬† <br><br>The Thermic Array will not be patented. The details of constructing the Thermic Array will be freely, openly, thoroughly,¬† and widely avaliable for the overall betterment of civilization.¬†0 <br><br>Thermic Arrays are not unreservedly good. Some foresight of the consequences is needed. For example,¬† endlessly powered boomboxes would be so portable and easy to operate that very young children could carry them around and make a lot of disturbing sound. This could provide teaching moments where children learn to consider more effects of their actions. Music talent may emerge. <br><br>People everywhere can have any electrical or refrigeration appliance they feel a need for and can buy. Small items will work immediately when unpacked, large items need some assembly and instalation and accommodation of their size. Community or personal sharing of appliances would be easier if energizing them was easy and cheap.<br><br><br>I think lt should be manufactured in AI operated factories within a cooperative managed coglomerate. The semicustom products would be open to public knowledge and sold at commodity prices for the overall betterment of civilization. Initial prototype funding would be a crowdsourced grant needing sophisticated management.¬† <br><br>Aloha,<br>Charles M Brown¬† lll<br>Kilauea,¬† Kauai¬† Hƒ∞ 96754

 I want to add one thing: go back and listen to the Oompa Loompa songs. All of them, any of them. First off, they&#39;re catchy as hell; they&#39;re the only thing I remember from the movies. But there are two details that add to &quot;Wonka the trickster god&quot;: first, they use the singular I/me, like &quot;if you are wise you&#39;ll listen to me&quot;; second, their songs are specific to the situations. It&#39;s like the songs are WW speaking through a hivemind, and as a trickster god, it is very likely more than legal fine print that binds the Oompa Loompas to him and his successors seemingly eternally. Not to mention, the song lyrics are so needlessly spiteful and cruel that it feels out-of-place if it&#39;s their words and wills and not WW&#39;s. And the lyrics (&quot;you know exactly who&#39;s to blame: the mother and the father&quot;) show that WW knows that parents are generally to blame for younger children being awful, but still punishes the children just because he can. The songs are the sadistic, vain theatrics of a mad god whose followers are automaton-like extensions of his fiendish will.

 In the 1971 movie, Wonka tips his hand through his use of Slugworth as a strawman tempter. The entire contest is rigged. Wonka knew exactly where those tickets were going and probably had Slugworth ensure that a certain type of child received the winning bars (probably by paying clerks for information of regular customers then giving them the tickets to hand to those selected kids). <br><br>We know this because Slugworth appears on live TV at the sight of the winner as soon as they win. And when Veruca&#39;s factory workers open the ticket, you can see Slugworth among the rows of workers  handing out boxes only to pull the employee out of the crowd and bring the ticket to Veruca HIMSELF. And how the hell can Slugworth intercept Charlie on his way home unless he KNEW that Charlie was going to win beforehand. <br><br>Also consider the rules of the contest. The factory-opening ceremony is given a concrete date printed right on the ticket (Oct 15th, I think). If the contest was truly random, there is more of a chance of only one person finding the ticket in time for the tour. It would make far more sense for Wonka to meet the five winners AFTER they&#39;ve been determined and verified. But he confidently sets a date ahead of time because he knows his scouts can find five kids out in the world before the tour begins.<br><br>Charlie was set up from the start as a patsy for any human rights violations Wonka&#39;s company may face once people (or governments) look into the absurd production rate of chocolate despite no new workers. The value of Wonka Chocolate balloons due to the contest, making ripe for an IPO. And once Wonka cashes out his shares, he can live in obscene wealth in complete obscurity with no consequences. The man played 4D chess with the global economy and won.

 Chocolate should be a luxury product.<br><br>Human trafficking, and exploitation of child labour and underpaid/slave labour are rampant in cocoa production. Cocoa is grown as forests, so short of sophisticated sting operations and massive systematic surprise raids, labour fairness certificates are next to impossible to supervise, making them essentially meaningless feel-good stickers.<br><br>Cocoa harvesting is physical and dangerous, even adults accustomed to the tasks and in good health can end up with serious or even lethal injuries. There is no specific time window for when the crop is ripe, so harvest is constant and involves distances. The cocoa fruit grows on a short stem on the trunk of the tree. It is chopped off with a machete. A large part of the fruit is useless for production, so instead of wasting energy and time by hauling unprocessed fruit, harvesters will periodically stop and husk what they&#39;ve gathered. This means holding the large, roughly lemon shaped fruit steady and chopping into it with the machete.<br><br>Due to the labour intensiveness of cocoa harvesting, and the low price of raw cocoa, owners of cocoa groves have great incentive to exploit child and slave labour, and few legitimate options to run their operations. At the price they get for their raw cocoa, the most logical use for wages is enforcers, not labourers. No one is getting paid anywhere near enough to care if a kid has shoes, gets treatment for injuries, or is being abused, as long as that kid is leaving with a machete and an empty basket, and coming back with a machete and a basket full of cocoa.

 Roald Dahl wrote some of the most subversive, creative, enjoyable, and wonderful books for both children and adults. It turns out he was also a keen racist, anti-semite and a Tory. Do we throw out everything he wrote? Or do we acknowledge that nothing is black and white? This is a perfect example of non-binary: he was not <b>just</b> a bad man, for example he also devoted himself to his family and children to the extent that, he invented ventricular catheters/shunt valves which have helped countless people over the intervening decades. He was also a wartime spy and fighter pilot who actively fought against the nazis.<br> <br><br>ALL current media is pro-capitalism. As a socialist I hate that fact, but surely we can target people who are actively trying to promote it, rather than people that include it as part of the narrative. Was he trying to promote capitalism, or was he describing a business that was based on capitalistic ethics, warts and all?<br><br>This is a brilliant description of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it&#39;s really unnecessarily harsh. Is this worse than children&#39;s literature from 100 years ago for example? Or are we expected to judge this by 2022 standards? Should we do the same for Dickens?<br><br>This is all too easy.

Little did I know I was walking into a truly unique ride made by someone who actually feels like they&#39;ve read more than three books. What an excellent way to get people who mindlessly consume videos like the one advertised in the thumbnail (like me, lol) to look up from their sketchbook and wonder what the fuck they&#39;re watching. Wonderful stuff, will be sending it to unsuspecting friends.

 I was a kid without much of a childhood ( I migrated from China to Singapore when I was young and spent my days just reading children books and watching DVDs) I still remember the first time I watched the movie was because my student care center just happened to had the movie and a lot of kids enjoyed it. ( Before this I didn&#39;t even know what was movies. ) When I watched it, I remember thinking about why were the children punished so heavily.  (I remember thinking that the punishments were to harsh or something) and how Charlie was a really boring character. So for the whole duration of the movie, I was just sitting there wondering why where the children in the student care so interested in the movie. So when I saw this video it opened me up to a perspective that I did not think about while resonating with my little 6 year-old self.

 One should consider that in all his literature (both for children and for adults) Roald Dahl consistently expressed an acidly bleak and nihilistic world view; none of his narratives should be taken at face value, but instead should be seen as the work of a man who regarded culture, tradition, and institutions as deadly, cruel, inhuman, and inescapable. There are no heroes, only dupes; there are no victories; only temporary escapes; and there is no justice; only reflexive violence and ignoble destruction. Even as a child, I could see that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a wryly sadistic inversion of older overtly moralizing children&#39;s literature in the spirit of Hilaire Belloc&#39;s satiric poems, and suffused with grim gallows humor.

Like five nights at freddies, its primed for a horror mystery game. You can twists in lin still in spirit eploring , or even taking from real life bizarre practices.<br><br>And charlie iosnt the right person to tackle anything there, because you need a benevolent and cunning person willing to go againt the strain, which charlie is not.<br>Dunno hhy i think of garibaldo on bablyon   and he is very working clas and ends up in charge for his wif of a biiig company, and he is cunning and ruthless enough to track their skeletons and even more should he be found dead suspiciously they sent toindependent media. Good scene. Dunno if it makes the system tackled somewhat, but thats a prson ai would trust to at least try to improve and tackle a  corrupt system. An he is flawed,. shady, and what else, but he is honest and cunning enough to do something.<br><br>Also something fun having a orkingclass background person actually use that to support an opressed minority , i mean he was blackmaimled, but he wants to, but shut down the corruption with whatever shady means. I mean use some unsavory methods if nessesary to help justice be done..

 these lefties really do hate families, the main message of the story is that families are the most important things, support that comes from them.<br>calling Charlie an empty slate is malicious or idiotic, we root for him because he is kind and loving, it was him that changes Wonka, it wasn‚Äôt Wonka writing his beliefs into Charlie‚Ä¶<br>and the other kids are just representative of certain sins and how they might cause pain when those sins tum the person, it is not fat phobia or anything as ridiculous‚Ä¶

 This video explains why I didn&#39;t enjoy the story when I was a kid.  I&#39;m not sure I ever reread it -- and I have always been a rereader unless I pretty much dislike a book.<br><br>Would you like to make a video on &quot;Madeleine,&quot; the French (translated to English) story about a small girl who was brought up in a highly regimented fashion by nuns?  I think she was an orphan.  It&#39;s supposed to be a touching and heartwarming story for children, but again I really didn&#39;t like it when I was a child.  In this case, I think I did reread it several times, and I eventually figured out that the reason I disliked it was the extreme conformity imposed on the girls.

 I think the 2005 version shows the vibes crystal clear. <br><br>The focus on not showing Wonka&#39;s face at the start, the Oompa Loompas blank, almost dead faces, the dolls burning during the presentation and the color palette, it&#39;s just too much.<br><br>Also, Wonka is VERY unsettling in that adaptation, I remember feeling scared and weirded out by him.

Not only the parents of the &quot;bad&quot; kids, but Wonka and Charlie, too. I‚Äôve seen others criticize the film for putting so much emphasis on Wonka‚Äôs backstory and for his personality being so different from any other version, but, to me, it really emphasized how limiting traditions and views are passed generationally. The film ends with Charlie encouraging Wonka to confront that impact directly by accepting that he can still have a relationship with his father despite their differences. It also ends by emphasizing (through explicit narration at the end of the film that sums up the message) that Wonka being accepted into Charlie&#39;s family was a bigger win than Charlie winning the factory. \r<br>\r<br>Progress arises from the rejection of a status quo that is often reinforced by parents. It&#39;s still tied to a narrative that fails to address many of the issues brought up in this video, but, to me, it was a decent direction for an adaptation to take.']

 I‚Äôve always been in a low income family so as a kid I grew up absolutely despising the ‚Äúbad‚Äù children in the movie and taking joy in seeing their wants backfire on them. But now that I‚Äôm older I really have grown to sympathize more with them. I tried to be like Charlie and be polite and quiet and submissive as a kid because I had this idea that it was the right way to be, or that I could prove myself worthy enough to get out of my financial situation. Looking back I‚Äôve started to hate Wonka and even the whole movie for a lot of reasons. I let a lot of horrible treatment slide as a kid. I think children should be allowed to be selfish sometimes. They should be allowed to be angry at those in power and sometimes it‚Äôs normal to be greedy. I shouldn‚Äôt have to make myself small to gain the adoration of the wealthy. I‚Äôve started walking away from exploitative situations and trying to assert myself and even be aggressive when necessary and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something I should be penalized for. Nothing will change until working class people start demanding more for themselves and their communities.

 I see a flaw in the way you‚Äôve described meritocracy. You said meritocracy is when people get rewarded/punished as they deserve. In that definition, meritocracy could be a good thing if it actually existed perfectly. Meritocracy, however, is actually the rewarding of people for qualities people value like hard work for example. Because of that, the very concept of meritocracy is morally wrong. Even if there was a perfect meritocracy as it was supposed to exist, people would still value and reward people for hegemonic capitalist beliefs.

 One of the possible reasons for Oompa-Loompa&#39;s singing is that it&#39;s a leftover clich√© of old pro-slavery propaganda. Slave ship captains and crews would force slaves they were transporting to cheer on command. There&#39;s an account from 1795 by Zachary Macaulay (CW: multiple deaths, slavery, suicide attempts, horrifyingly unsanitary conditions):<br><br>May 5. Captain Y‚Äî‚Äîtold us we should see that a slave-ship was a very different thing from what it had been reported. We should find the slaves rejoicing in their happy state.... He accordingly said a few words to the women, to which they replied with three cheers and a laugh. He went forward on the main deck and spoke the same words to the men, who made the same reply. &quot;Now,&quot; says he, &quot;are you not convinced that Mr. Wilberforce has conceived very improperly of slave-ships?&quot;...<br><br>7th. I observed one woman handcuffed, and inquired the cause. I found she had lately attempted to drown herself, and had been caught by the leg just as she had thrown herself over the side....<br><br>8th. The men-slaves were brought on deck for the first time since our sailing.... While the ship was on the coast they had made an unsuccessful attempt to get possession of her.... The two ringleaders are now chained to each other by the neck; besides having on the same fetters which are worn by the others....<br><br>23rd. I observed to-day, as on former occasions, several of the slaves rejecting their food. The officer on duty began to threaten and shake his cat at such as refused to eat.... The slaves then made a shew of eating by putting a little rice into their mouths; but whenever the officer&#39;s back was turned, they threw it into the sea....<br><br>29th. About ten o&#39;clock in the forenoon, to my great joy, the island [of Barbados] appeared in sight. The slaves set up a great shout; but in a few seconds their countenances fell. Possibly they thought that some great change was now about to take place in their condition, and their ignorance of what it might be filled them with painful forebodings....<br><br>From the above account you will conceive that my situation could not have been a pleasant one. During the night I hung over a crowd of slaves huddled together on the floor, whose stench at times was almost beyond endurance.... Their cup is full of pure, unmingled sorrow.... Eight died during the three weeks I was on board.

 I think it just barely says the points outloud and it&#39;s all under this thin veil of a fun story is purposeful. <br>Cause when it&#39;s said to loudly, (seeing as it had to be put through an industry to get as big as it has) its either forced to changed, or gets shut down entirely. <br><br>Take something like the lorax for example. It&#39;s very on the nose about how corporate bread hurts the environment. But for the movie adaptation it got changed. The better song for the point would&#39;ve been biggering but instead we get how bad can I be to portray the onceler as naive to the harm he&#39;s doing.

 Thank you for doing such a thorough examination of this story across media - aside from the impact of the story itself, I live in a city that makes quite a fuss about Roald Dahl having been a famous resident and they seem all too quick to forget that he was a proud colonialist, to name just one of his faults.

 Yeah, the first time I saw even part of the Wilder Wonka I was 100% sure he was the bad guy, and I was pretty young. He&#39;s not a good guy, and he wasn&#39;t supposed to be, people just associate money with superior morality because we&#39;re hard-wired to believe that those ahead of us earned their place, and that the system isn&#39;t broken and we&#39;re being exploited. I&#39;m sure this is because the humans that weren&#39;t like that either sold out and joined the elite, or were killed because they would eventually turn against the corrupt elite, and since most people aren&#39;t like them, they usually failed and would be executed. If you&#39;re self-aware and can see through the stupid BS, the elite will demand you join or they&#39;ll kill you, it&#39;s still like that.

 I haven&#39;t read the book, and I only really liked the first movie (so I&#39;m ignorant and biased!) but I feel like many of the fundamental things you say apply to storytelling in general, especially regarding keeping the status quo, societal order, the system, etc. these are not really Willy Wonka-specific... and modern-day slavery? this happens in many industries, there&#39;s exploitation of people and land happening all over the world, again, not Willy Wonka or chocolate specific. Why do you equate the story and its messages to the later corporate use of it? It&#39;s not like as a lover of the first movie I&#39;m a greedy consumer of Nerds, or am left with a capitalist mentality. A lot of things you say are just interpretations and could easily not apply to most people who enjoy the movie or book or whatever without reading too much into it or developing theories about it, etc. I&#39;m not questioning the video! But I feel like you talk about it in a voice as if you&#39;re telling &#39;the truth about Willy Wonka&#39; but the truth is whatever the person who watched/read it wants it to be in the end, that is the true effect it has on society. And to me it seems like at least the movie left a lot more positive things than anything else. Shouldn&#39;t that be the main focus? And what about your comments on Charlie&#39;s personality? in my opinion what you refer to is based on intellectual analyses, but what about the more straight-forward non-symbolic message? I felt it was his simplicity, and calm kindness, and his not wanting to steal the recipe, etc. that are all good qualities to have, period. The other kids act like entitled brats, so Charlie in comparison is a kind of role model in that sense. I highly doubt any person who watched the movie went on to believe you must follow the corporate ladder and never question the system, that slavery is good or that killing children who misbehave is the right thing to do, or even watched the movie thinking it gave them an understanding of how the world works.... if anything I&#39;d dare to guess it inspired some people to be creative instead of profit-driven... again though, I haven&#39;t read the book and I may be talking from a more simplistic wishful thinking point of view

 It&#39;s kind of a hard one to disentangle because Roald Dahl had a lot of very problematic attitudes, but I don&#39;t think Willy Wonka is ever written as a straightforwardly benevolent character. I don&#39;t really understand how someone could come to that conclusion in good faith, having read the books as an adult, so I&#39;m very glad Zoe recognised how complicated the character is. He&#39;s deliberately presented as morally ambiguous in many ways that even young kids pick up on. <br><br>Wonka punishes the &#39;wrongdoers&#39; in ways that are so disproportionate to their offences that, even when I was 6, I felt sorry for all the &#39;bad&#39; kids except Veruca Salt. Charlie and other characters occasionally question Wonka&#39;s excuses for his behaviour (including his exploitation of the Oompah-Loompahs) and his responses are usually deliberately  weak and unsatisfactory. As prejudiced as Dahl clearly was, there are clear anti-authoritarian attitudes throughout his work, and I think he was probably using Wonka as a way to make a few sly digs at capitalist excesses. Hearing that &#39;Wonka as God&#39; argument made me wonder if he was also intended as a deliberate critique of religion. <br><br>On balance, I&#39;ve personally always thought Wonka was intended as an example of the &#39;trickster&#39; archetype in the tradition of Loki or Anansi, but that his character is unfortunately tainted by some of Roald Dahl&#39;s personal prejudices (which were sadly commonplace in people of his generation). I still hold that opinion, but this video has given me some interesting food for thought.

 The whole bit about Wonka the dark god put words to the thing that I always hated about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I grew up in an evangelical household and both the 70s movie and book left me with the same frustration I felt at every Christian description of why punishment was right and necessary. The narrative seemed to imply what happened to these kids was funny/deserved and I was actively upset, only to be told &quot;well that&#39;s what happens when kids are bad&quot;.  I felt a deep kinship with Charlie as the &quot;good&quot; child but I also felt a little frustrated that the whole reason he was good was because he never once spoke up about how bad things were for him. So uh, this is all to say you hit that aspect perfectly, excellent work.

The new title made me go &quot;wait, this is gonna be a critical reading of the story, isn&#39;t it?&quot; and WOW it&#39;s super well constructed and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t miss it.

 I love this! I didn&#39;t realize that Oompah Loompahs were a retcon on his part. <br><br>The only part I disagree with, which I&#39;ve talked to other people about as well - In the Gene Wilder depiction, I believe that he was faking his anger at the end. I believe that his plan was that he would put them through temptations, a sort of &quot;try it and see&quot; reverse version of Dante&#39;s Inferno. And when they got to the end, if they gave in to some temptation (that didn&#39;t result in their premature departure), he was going to yell at them and dismiss them, just to see if they&#39;d then return the gobstopper, as that was the item Slughorn asked about, and the only item Wonka emphasized shouldn&#39;t be given to others. Whoever returned the gobstopper would get the factory.

 From my first encounter with Wonka (seeing the 1971 film on a rainy day at summer camp) I‚Äôve read him as a villain, and I still thought that after reading the books. I didn‚Äôt even really ponder that people were out there <b>not</b> reading him as a villain. The kids being asshats doesn‚Äôt justify anything Wonka does before, during, or after their visit. And yet in the context of the franchise and the conditions that produced it, I have to admit I was probably not reading him as intended.

 Now I am going to tell you a story of a 11 year old boy who never read books. Many years before, from his perspective, when he began learning how to read, in his very first year of school, his teacher at the time had punished him for his terrible spelling by keeping him in the class most of his break times and forced him to copy out of dictionaries because he had trouble with spelling. And so, to his mind, he would never understand spelling, words were a mystery to him, the strange way they were formed, other than the letters themselves, just felt random and stupid. <br>Back in his eleventh year of life, his teacher told him he was falling behind in reading comprehension even though he had been doing the work in his classes as best he could. He looked out at the world with a blurry vision, not knowing that in his next year he would be taken to get glasses and he would have a whole new world revealed to him, but for now he was a small child looking at a daunting world through broken eyes. Falling behind the other children, the only things he had chosen to read before this time had been comics, but since his teacher had told him he needed to catch up with the other children in reading he decided to brave the school library.<br>There he found the Rahul Dahl books, the magic, and horror of the stories captivated his extremely active imagination, when he read the books, over and over again, his mind was transported to new worlds, worlds he could see clearly, scary worlds with very scary people, but worlds with boys and girls he could personalise with and who were the heroes.<br><br>Yes, that boy was me, I read charlie and the chocolate factory many times.<br><br>And I approve of this interpretation. Wonka was scary, and obviously a very bad person to me, and I thought it was obvious to charlie too, which is why I started reading about the great glass elevator too, but I never finished that one, I cannot remember why. I read most of the other Rahul Dahl books in that library, matilda, james and the giant peach (although I didnt read its sequel either)... they were short books, but filled with magic. Although the magic always had a harsh bight. There was always an air of horror to those books, the illustrations helped convey that feeling.<br><br>I always thought that charlie could see the evil that wonka had done pretty clearly, I always hoped he would be smart enough to be a better person, but maybe it was just me... I learned from that book, from those books.<br><br>I am nearly 40 (only a few months) and I am an anarchist and very anti capitalist - especially the unchecked and flagrantly abusive capitalism illustrated by wonka and the real history of human capitalism.<br><br>Thank you for listening to my ted talk.

 I watched this movie (the older one, I think, as I don&#39;t think I was as old as 10 at the time so it couldn&#39;t have been the 2005 one) as a kid and could never really enjoy it? I didn&#39;t get the same entertainment from it my parents did when they were watching it with me. Sure, the kids are horrible ‚Äî but their punishments are horrific and evil. The whole place was always incredibly off-putting to me, a grotesque celebration of rampant gluttony. The vibes of everything involved are absolutely rancid.<br>A lot of this discourse seems, odd. The story is clearly awful as a work of fiction for children if taken at face value. The house of a terribly poor person being adjacent to the chocolate factory run by a ridiculously wealthy billionaire shouldn&#39;t be seen as normal so much as it should be seen as an intentional juxtaposition. That Charlie spent all of his money on chocolate for himself only (and that in the process he gives that money to an already incredibly wealthy man his family reveres as a god) and was rewarded for it should be seen less as a depiction of consumerism in a positive light and more as a condemnation of the Christian god. This whole story could be viewed less as a &quot;Hero&#39;s Journey&quot; that celebrates capitalism by comparing it to Christianity and more as a long-winded diatribe against both capitalism and Christianity. (A quick Wikipedia search would seem to confirm my suspicions ‚Äî that the intention here is not to elevate capitalism by comparison to Christianity, but to condemn Christianity by comparison to capitalism. The article claims that Dahl came to view Christianity as &quot;a sham&quot;.)<br>Really, I think this whole story is written in a way that takes advantage of a child&#39;s natural empathy to illuminate the injustice depicted in the book. Only the guidance of a parent could cause the horrors depicted therein to be viewed as good.

 I always saw Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory as a critique of capitalism&#39;s flaws, packaged as a humorous children&#39;s story. Sort of a &quot;see how stupid and ridiculous this looks? Well some adults do business like this in real life!&quot; kind of thing.<br><br>But maybe that&#39;s just because I read the story as an older child (11-13), and I grew up with parents who prohibited me from eating any candy, so I never associated it with happiness the way many other kids do. Even then, I can totally see how a younger child (especially one who is addicted to chocolate or other candy) could read/watch this story and see it as a glorification of capitalism and excessive consumerism.<br><br>From the Oompa-Loompas and squirrels being indentured servants, to the complete disregard for worker and visitor safety in the factory, to the very premise of manufacturing nutritionless addictive substances to sell to children, that story really did sugar-coat everything and avoid addressing the underlying systemic wrongs that make such a business possible.

That conflicts with my opinions on morality - I would say that involuntary suffering is the foundation of what is morally bad, happiness and fulfillment of personal values are the foundation of what is morally good, simple as that...so punishment for the sake of punishment causes involuntary suffering without a sufficient amount of good to justify it...so I see it as immoral.<br>So...I dislike this story because it conflicts with my morals.

 Some thing(s) I think you forgot to mention about Willy Wonka‚Äôs character:<br>The guy is a kid in an adult‚Äôs body, and not exclusively in a good way. That‚Äôs one way that I like to imagine him. He may enjoy having fun with his work, being imaginative, and experiencing childlike wonder, but he also embodies some negative traits often found in children: not taking situations seriously enough, being funny when it‚Äôs inappropriate, teasing Mike, and so on. In fact, just picture him as a child in some scenes. He basically never grew up. However, of course, that doesn‚Äôt excuse his actions. Josh Scorcher, another YouTuber, pointed out that Wonka‚Äôs sense of morality is a little off. He has issues trusting LITERALLY ANYONE. He views all people as bad people until proven otherwise, and he thinks that because he‚Äôs aware of how bad people can be, that makes him a better person by comparison and a moral arbiter when it actually doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm glad that the 2005 movie lightly tackled that. Another way of looking at him is as an artist of sorts. One can look at his mass layoffs as paranoia that his artistic integrity will be lost, and integrity is VITAL to artists! He didn‚Äôt want his art to be copied and abused by envious businesspeople who didn‚Äôt play fair. It still doesn‚Äôt make the layoffs right, of course. I know that.<br><br>Another thing that‚Äôs interesting that you forgot to mention is that the kid‚Äôs fates weren‚Äôt just a lesson for them but also their parents. They need to be SHOWN the errors of their parenting so that they get the message and hopefully ensure that their kids turn out better.<br><br>Also, semi-hot take, but Wonka wasn‚Äôt entirely to blame for the Oompa Loompas being taken. They technically consented to being taken and being paid in cocoa beans. Do what you will with that perspective, but you must admit that Wonka held up his promise. What if they never valued money? He gave them what they wanted in exchange for their service. That‚Äôs basically every employment transaction but with a different currency. It‚Äôs not as close to slavery as one might think, but it‚Äôs still a little morally questionable.<br><br>Lastly, I wanna talk about Charlie and how he got in. I never saw it as a way of conveying ‚ÄúShut up and consume products.‚Äù People can have favorite brands, like how I prefer Reese‚Äôs cups over Snickers. I don‚Äôt think that fate rewards greed or generosity like that. Good thing and bad things happen to both good people and bad people to varying degrees, resulting in varying lifestyle qualities. When the quote brought up the concept of being aware of the negative lessons stories can teach, I thought that while that is a nice sentiment, I want to try to understand what the author was intending instead of focusing too much on audience takeaways. I want to know the core of the point they are trying to make. In this story‚Äôs case: respect others and be careful how you raise your kids. That was the core message. At the time, not as many people were focusing on how society functions as a whole. Instead, they focused on their immediate circle of people because that‚Äôs who they had the most influence over, and that makes me think how the immediate social circle has gone neglected in an age where the whole world can be held in your hands.<br><br>Also, fun fact, Western countries are the leading reducers of carbon emissions. China is leading in emissions, and they do NOT give a üí©. We can never convince them, and we‚Äôd be fooling ourselves if we tried. The Chinese dictator only cares about being the most powerful contender on the world stage.

 catcf was never a big part of my childhood, but I saw the musical on tour a few years ago. wonka felt like a villain to me (noah weiss did a fucking incredible job with his character), n I think the musical somehow leans into that, even if it might be on accident. he‚Äôs a much more tragic figure there. he has a breakdown at the end. if I remember correctly he almost attempts suicide. I like the way they highlighted that nobody is free from guilt, and I think wonka feeling genuinely guilty is such a fascinating concept - unfortunately, like you said, it ultimately ended up so close yet so far. there‚Äôs still the glass elevator ride, charlie still inherits the factory, those kids are still dead, and the oompa loompas are still enslaved. don‚Äôt get me wrong, ‚Äúsame as it ever was‚Äù is a great concept in musical theatre. it works very well - some great examples of this motif would be cabaret, the oklahoma! revival, hadestown, etc. there doesn‚Äôt have to be revolution, or even change, for a point to be made - the issue with catcf is instead that no point is made at all

 Great video! I loved the initial parts about the perspectives of a story based on what lense you want to give them and at first i thought this would be a bit tedious and repetitive but it was awesome!<br><br>I did roll my eyes at the &quot;fatphobia&quot; part of Augustus Gloop and let me be clear, Fatphobia is a real thing that affects many people. <br><br>However, c&#39;mon, Augustus is not &quot;judged&quot; for being fat, he is judged because he literally can&#39;t stop eating, shoveling stuff into his mouth, which seemed unhealthy for both his mental and physical health, especially as a child! Of course, the only ones guilty here and his parents, since they allowed that behavior to continue for so long. <br><br>What kind of man would Augustus become when he grows up if he didn&#39;t change, probably no time, because he would have eaten himself into an early grave.<br><br>For me, this is not &quot;Poor Augustus boy, bullied from being fat&quot;, in the 2005 adaptation he was kind of a dick, and in every adaptation i have seen, his level of consumption is just concerning. <br><br>Not every fat person is fat because they ate a lot, so clearly that&#39;s not the problem here.

 Interestingly enough cherubim in what I believe is the oldest definition..(the Bible), are not little chubby angels but actually special angels that have several heads, some of animals and I think one of a man. And they aren&#39;t small. Just as a side note! It&#39;s a common misconception.<br><br>Also Lucifer was God&#39;s most valued angel (I think a Cherub) but when he was thrown from heaven he does not work for God but against him, though he&#39;s given power on Earth. Until the end when Jesus returns. <br><br>Many believe God IS trying to make a point by all of this..but no Lucifer isn&#39;t directly working for God and was not when he tricked Eve. That&#39;s why he was then forced to slither on his belly. <br><br>But very creepy way of explaining everything with Wonka! üòÇ I did not expect this to be so weird! Pleasant surprise.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=54m00s">54:00</a> There&#39;s a detail that&#39;s making me uncertain about all this. Wonka doesn&#39;t have any non-Oompa-Loompa workers. Like, at all. Or deathbots. He lacks robots. He&#39;s got some animals that are well trained, but I don&#39;t think he trained them. Slavery is built on control. Wonka logically just has no control over any of this. An Oompa-Loompa could gank that bitch any day of the week and there is no reprisal. The Oompa-Loompas are shown to be in complete control. Wonka just shows up in a room that&#39;s functioning perfectly fine without him and screws around a bit before leaving, so it&#39;s pretty certain that the Oompa-Loompas doopa-dee do have control over everything. They also have access to massive amounts of dangerous equipment, and clearly top notch education given their musical numbers and variety of highly specialized skills. We see them do things that require college level skills. We don&#39;t really see any living conditions specifically, but they both are physically fit and have body fat so their food supply is good. It&#39;s hard to analyze much more for this, but overall generally slaves don&#39;t don&#39;t have as much unrestricted freedom as they do. They certainly seem to have the same if not more extreme views than Wonka. Slaves historically have always been anti-slavery in some number. Brainwashing isn&#39;t magic; abusing people makes them upset. The Oompa-Loompas are absolutely willing to kill anyone who displeases them, that&#39;s for sure. And we never see the political structure of the place, so we&#39;re really assuming a lot. Nobody ever comes in or goes out, but they&#39;re eating well enough to do gymnastics. We barely see the factory, so there&#39;s absolutely room to make real food.<br><br>So like... are the Oompa-Loompas slaves, or is Wonka&#39;s factory secretly a communist state inside wherever the heck they are? A communist state existing in the world still needs to engage in trade with the outside world to prosper and seeks to bring wealth into the country still simply because of surviving the world stage. So, that would handwave anything to do with the &quot;they&#39;re engaging in trade with the outside world&quot; aspect of this thought. Really it all comes down to the internal political structure. It&#39;s easy to see them as slaves because of history, but that feels like trying to force the story to conform to expectations to me. Slavery needs some form of control, and Wonka just doesn&#39;t have any. No social control, no political control, no physical control, he&#39;s basically just along for the ride. Sure we see him give the occasional command, but what the heck is he going to do if they said no? Absolutely nothing. He can&#39;t. There&#39;s one Willy Wonka and who knows how many of them. He&#39;s got no slave drivers, no authorities to back him up, no machines to give him power, nothing. Based on that, it seems more likely that they just listen to him because they respect his leadership than because they have to. Wonka removed himself from the capitalist system and brings money in which by all indication has gone towards improving the &quot;nation&quot; he&#39;s built inside his factory. It comes across less like a master/slave situation and more like a &quot;this is our pet rich weirdo who comes up with awesome ideas and lets us all crash at his place&quot;, upscaled to a small nation. Given that they&#39;re all cut off from the authorities, the cops aren&#39;t going to be enforcing any power structures. Numerically speaking, if there&#39;s slavery going on, the one dude is probably the slave of the tens to hundreds of dudes. Historically, any situation where one guy has &quot;owned&quot; a bunch of people, he&#39;s needed both an entire crew to enforce it and a societal structure which will back him up. Wonka willingly has denied himself both. Those historical situations where &quot;one person&quot; had hundreds of slaves leaves out that they also had a bunch of employees to keep the slaves enslaved. Wonka doesn&#39;t have any of those, not even robot ones.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=55m45s">55:45</a> But what are the mechanisms that force it? Shareholders expect endless growth, and if not, the company&#39;s stock plummets and the company goes out of business. Usually we&#39;d discuss why they expect it, but we don&#39;t need to. So... Wonka doesn&#39;t have to answer their demands. So it comes down to what Wonka and the Oompa-Loompas want, not what outsiders want. So Wonka only needs to profit enough for everyone in the factory&#39;s quality of life. He <i>doesn&#39;t</i> need to endlessly grow. Wonka is explicitly outside the mechanism which creates this problem: the stock market.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=49m00s">49:00</a> I&#39;ve never liked this expression, because it just seems like whataboutism to me. The world we should be striving for is a world so good it would be disgusted by us. Think of the way that we react to the crimes of Christopher Columbus. If things go right, people will react the same way to men like Jeff Bezos in a few centuries. But, think of the way that we react to the common people who let people like Columbus do those things. If things go right, people will react the same way to people who let people like Jeff Bezos do what they&#39;ve done. That&#39;s us, by the way. We&#39;re those people. <br><br>But in the context of this, let&#39;s ask ourselves: could anyone but the state or Elon Musk&#39;s parents prevented him from ending up the way he did? Nope. But, now, let&#39;s say some genius billionaire stranger got a bad feeling about child Elon and specifically engineered a PTSD trap that made him have a trauma response to the idea of abandoning people in need in order to escape to safety himself. That sounds like the good timeline, doesn&#39;t it? The parents can educate a child in other ways, sometimes even teachers or other adults. In ideal circumstances (not America or many other countries), the state can protect the children and prevent terrible parenting too. But in circumstances where the parents won&#39;t and the state can&#39;t? Realistically speaking, your options are do nothing or use overkill. Some of the kids are rich. We return now to the Elon and Jeff point. Wonka: preventing future Musks and Bezoses. Basically, Wonka would frag baby Hitler.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=35m30s">35:30</a> I think there&#39;s also an important thing that&#39;s missed by making it all a follower point. Charlie isn&#39;t supposed to just follow, but mantle and replace. I wasn&#39;t expecting to do this, but the first comparison I can think of for them here is actually the Hero of Kvatch mantling the god Sheogorath in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. To mantle a god is to become that god, and to mantle a god, one must be like that god. For Sheogorath, his domain is madness. <br><br>But for Willy Wonka, he&#39;s a bit less pinned down. Really he embodies all <i>nine</i> deadly sins. The book originally was going to have seven kids for the seven, but originally before there were seven, there were nine. The rest are obvious, so I&#39;ll only go into the two new/old ones. Acedia, or apathy. His reaction to Mike Teevee is the peak meme for apathy, we&#39;ve got that immediately. The other is Vainglory, or vanity. His secrets? His constant boasting? His need for admiration? His showing off? His need for total obedience? He&#39;s so vain. <br><br>So, <i>Charlie</i> needs to embody all the sins in order to mantle Willy Wonka. But Wonka isn&#39;t a chaotic mass of uncontrolled evil, now is he? Chaotic, sure. But perfectly measured chaos. Surgical explosions. So, what does Charlie need to do in order to embody this? Well, show balance. He shows selflessness, we&#39;ve got that down. But balance, not to get too Star Wars Fandom about it, doesn&#39;t come from eliminating all the bad. Balance is between. When he indulges in sin, he is not taking from his family. Out of everyone justified to have that money in the family, he&#39;s the most justified. None of their existing plans required it; he was the only one aware of it. Furthermore, he&#39;s a child and has no moral responsibility to support his family. So, when he indulged in greed, he indulged in morally justifiable greed. Balance. He&#39;s not just being a perfect follower. He&#39;s mantling. That&#39;s Wonka&#39;s whole point; if Wonka only wanted him to follow, everything would be a lie. Wonka wants him to lead.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=47m27s">47:27</a> Edit because another thing that I think adds to my point actually. He isn&#39;t that! You said it yourself, he spent the money he found on a greedy choice. He shows normal human desires and indulgences, but uses what he can get for himself instead of actively harming his family. He&#39;s not perfect, he&#39;s balanced.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=49m42s">49:42</a> Thinking on this, I think you&#39;ve got it backwards. Charlie Bucket is only sinless in the most pop culture way possible, which is important for this work obviously. Charlie, however, is balanced. Greed has come up multiple times. Lust... well he&#39;s a child, but in child terms it applies to his feelings towards chocolate. Starving, he gives up his money for chocolate out of a desire for it. That is the sin of lust, not just gluttony. Sloth and apathy go hand in hand and are just... blatantly obvious. He gets left behind repeatedly and he does nothing about the kids getting harmed. Envy, well, yeah that&#39;s the whole &quot;watching the TV, wishing he could get a golden ticket&quot; thing. Vanity is a bit weaker but also goes with the apathy towards the kids getting hurt, he only thinks about himself and his family (which is an extension of himself). Wrath, he stands by Wonka&#39;s and Grandpa Joe&#39;s. Even when they&#39;re contradictory. Pride... &quot;I&#39;ve got a golden ticket&quot;. It&#39;s worshiping a golden idol, it&#39;s kinda obvious. But the thing is, he has control and doesn&#39;t take them out on people or cause harm to the innocent with them. Balance. Both Wonka and Charlie show all nine deadly sins, but unlike the others, they also have control over themselves. They control it; they are not controlled by it. I agree with the final point about the system, but I think it&#39;s not that he&#39;s sinless, but has control over himself. He is explicitly said to be inheriting Wonka&#39;s position. We see that Wonka embodies all the sins over and over, so it makes more sense that he does too. 

 	Replies: ['PosthumanHeresy', '@OdinsSage I may have been thinking about this series in a lot of depth for... eleven years almost. &quot;Wonka as a god&quot; reminds me a lot of the <i>much</i> older &quot;Wonka as Lucifer&quot; (earliest I know of is 1990/1991) idea. Since the book is <i>explicitly</i> themed the kids around the seven deadly sins (two kids were cut for the other two during the book&#39;s writing), the ringleader in this circus of sin being Lucifer makes sense. Wonka&#39;s embodiment of sin was agreed upon by the video. But it just seemed very contradictory the idea that Charlie could mantel the master of sin-punishment and embodiment of sin without representing a child version of that same thing. <br><br>To use a semi-Biblical/semi-pop culture description, if Wonka is Satan or any sort of god, Charlie has to be Lucifer before the fall or any sort of equivalent. Mantling gods doesn&#39;t really come up often, but that&#39;s explicitly what Wonka wants from Charlie (take over my magical kingdom after I am gone, and with doing so I can be certain you will become Exactly Like Me, when applied to the supernatural position of godhood) so the idea of Charlie as a follower and not as the one who mantles him only works if he&#39;s outright lying to Charlie about his purpose for him. There&#39;s very few works that set any meaningful framework for inheriting the position of a god through an adopted framework where the god is guaranteed the successor will be an identical successor. <br><br>Charlie&#39;s trip through the chocolate factory witnessing the punishment of sin could be described as akin to Dante&#39;s Inferno (you probably guessed it from the framework of the sentence!), with Grandpa Joe as his Virgil. It even ends with him ascending to the heavens. But there&#39;s a key, strikingly important detail that differs between the two stories. In Dante&#39;s Inferno, Lucifer is trapped in the center of Hell, kept frozen in place by his own attempts to escape. In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka invites the damned in and takes them to their punishment himself. <br><br>I lied, there&#39;s a second difference. Dante doesn&#39;t inherit Hell. That&#39;s a pretty wild difference for such a weird amount of similarity. Wonka is a divine force whom punishes sinners and rewards the repentant but not sinless. Charlie inherits the job. Oddly enough, with the side of Charlie&#39;s class struggles, it could be seen as &quot;It&#39;s better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven&quot;. While he ascends, it&#39;s with the promise to return down and reign as king.', 'OdinsSage', 'Damn.']

 In the second third of this video I thought to myself what a sequel to one of the movies might be like. If Charlie&#39;s family would try to discourage him from being a capitalist, if the movie would be animated, how he would look, and than it hit me, Charlie would just be the Once-ler from Lorax (2012). Sure, the two franchises(?) are pretty different in their details and the impact of capitalism, but in how both characters resemble each other and with how Willy Wonka dresses up, I could not imagine the brown haired version of Charlie to look anyhow different from the Once-ler.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jbGyLayKjE&amp;t=24m30s">24:30</a> Sorry, no, let&#39;s not put Grandpa Joe&#39;s crimes on Willy Wonka. Wonka was oblivious to one important detail there: it wasn&#39;t <i>Charlie&#39;s</i> sin. He figured it out from Charlie&#39;s selflessness, because Charlie had just lost his hope and was willing to give up his backup hope in apology simply because he gave into temptation and felt guilt for that. But who, who I ask you, provided Charlie&#39;s temptation? Who but the very man expected to guide and protect him, his forefather, the progenitor of his line, his own grandfather. Grandpa Joe was the thief. Grandpa Joe was the man Wonka was mad at, he just was unaware. As soon as he figured out the truth, he realized he was in the wrong and corrected course. Grandpa Joe becoming furious with Wonka is the true amorality here. Here is a man who led his own grandson astray for no reason but &quot;I Wanna&quot;, and now when his grandson is baring the brunt of the punishment and the blame, what does he do? Does he confess his sins before Wonka and beg for forgiveness? No, he lies again. He lies, pretends Charlie really was the thief. He is ready to let Charlie take the blame, but Charlie would have never done anything wrong without being told to by an authority figure. Charlie is a child. He cannot be expected to have good logic telling valid and invalid authority apart. He was a good person the whole time. His only &quot;crime&quot; was trusting his grandfather, the man he should have been able to trust. The man his parents trusted to protect and watch over him. He betrayed not just his grandson, but his own child with his actions. Not all theft is immoral. Theft of soft drinks because they are novel is; they did not need it more. It still fits the fae angle, just with an added positive trait that Wonka will not blame a child for being led astray by malicious authority, their crime must be their choice and not something ordered. Which is pretty cool.

 I think Nostalgia Critic, when he did his &quot;Old Versus New&#39; on the Gene Wilder versus Johnny Depp versions of the movie, had a good point: in Wilder&#39;s version, Charlie&#39;s still a kid. He acts like a real person. He complains (a bit), he gets sad, he gets angry, he looks through the window of the candy store in his first scene, and, even when I was little, I thought how sad it wwas that he had to work so hard and was left out of the fun. I like Wilder&#39;s version best, because he&#39;s a superior actor to Depp (don&#39;t @ me), and because Charlie gets to be a real kid, and not the freaking Second Coming like in the Depp version with the chocolate Eucharist. Also, THAT scene, Zoe, with you and that chocolate bar...I&#39;m a straight woman, and I was even like, &quot;DAYUM!&quot; XD Also, though, in that version Charlie tries to save Augustus when he falls in the chocolate river, AND he takes the Fizzy Lifting Drinks.

 To me, the greatest telling of the Willy Wonka story is Snowpiercer (the original film to be specific). Yes the Wonka-Piercer theory is dumb, but the stories are great parallels of each other. The horror in Snowpiercer isn&#39;t the people within the train, it&#39;s the train itself, built to perpetuate an eternal class struggle. My favourite line in the story is when Mr Wilfred says &quot;My train is perfect, but its parts are not&quot;. Like all the successful capitalists in the real world, they fully acknowledge the suffering, but will still say the system is perfect. Where Willy Wonka embraces the system, Snowpeircer rejects it.

 Roald Dahl was quite an eccentric author, but at worst he was anti-Semitic, he believed Jews were money grubbing goblins, a sentiment prevalent with conservative Brits, which is ironic, because according to people like Dahl, it&#39;s okay to profit from capitalism, just as long as you were not Jewish, had Willy Wonka not being a founder of a candy factory, he would have been a villain, the Jeff Bezos of candy. Although Dahl&#39;s family apologised for Roald&#39;s beliefs, his books are still contaminated from his Tory leanings, his books should be removed from schools, and put into universities and colleges, to be analysed and deconstructed for future authors as lesson to write better than Roald Dahl.

 As a kid, I read a lot of Roald Dahl, and his movies were on constant rotation during school holidays. I can say with confidence that I essentially despise everything he ever put out. He wrote lessons for kids, and the lesson was that bullying, even up to the level of persecution, is justifiable.<br><br>These were not just products of their time. They were diatribes against all the people Dahl considered inferior. I&#39;m skimming over ethnicity and nationality because they&#39;re not my business to speak on, but these are certainly the most clear examples. Likewise, don&#39;t look up The Witches&#39; antisemitism on a full stomach.<br><br>There&#39;s the fatphobia, and ableism, and ugliness. This is because - as explicitly described in The Twits - &quot;when a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. [...] You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double-chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts [...] you will always look lovely.&quot; The protagonist just happens to always be skinny and physically typical, and the Witches having limb differences and alopecia is definitely not stigmatising. There are few characters he described as &quot;stupid&quot; who weren&#39;t some combination of angry, mean, criminal, working class, or demonised for daring to watching TV or like food incorrectly. His definition of goodness and intelligence was obedience to hegemony - asking too many questions or being impatient was an excuse for vitriolic punishment. The only time agency is rewarded is when justice must be brutally meted out.<br><br>Speaking of which, he loved to write women and girls with any kind of agency as having those &quot;bad&quot; traits as an excuse to describe them being tortured or abused. Not that men and boys aren&#39;t also tortured - more often in sacrifice. But it&#39;s, uh, weird how many of his antagonists tend to be proud women who are either too masculine or too adult, and when she&#39;s replaced, it tends to be with a competent and kind patriarch. Despite him being a product of an extremely unequal society where, for the longest time, women overruling men was abnormal.<br><br>Unfortunately, there&#39;s evidence that these were practiced hatreds. His first wife, Patricia Neal, divorced him because of the demeaning abuse and infidelity inflicted upon her. He bullied her for the neurological symptoms she displayed after several strokes - especially galling as it seems this was influenced by the memory of his daughter deteriorating in her dying hours. Fans will defend him for this, as Patricia&#39;s recovery influenced doctors to not abandon stroke victims entirely. He was rebuked for his antisemitism by Jews many times in his life, even children who knew they were being targeted. Having &quot;Jewish friends&quot; doesn&#39;t count for much when he was constantly cutting friends out for so much as criticising him for cheating on his disabled wife.<br><br>I have a lot of nostalgia and admiration for the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda movies, and was everlastingly trauma-bonded to The BFG. There are some nuanced and mature messages in there...but most came in adaption, and the ones that didn&#39;t were largely unintentional. The uncritical promotion of his work has, IMO, damaged the empathy of entire generations of readers, propagandising a good vs. bad, deserving vs. undeserving, Anglo-Saxon-supremacist authoritarian worldview.<br><br>They&#39;re great learning tools, and absolutely abhorrent that they&#39;re billed as crude but wholesome children&#39;s literature.

 Really hope you do a video on Ebinizer Scrooge. I&#39;ve always disliked how the book A Christmas Carol portrays the message that the solution to wealth disparity and corporate greed is simply that the evil billionaires should become better Christians and learn to give. Like Bob Cratchet is portrayed as a good guy for never asking for a raise or time of to spend with his family who are literally dying. Tiny Tim is going to die and Bob Cratchet is seen as more pious for not asking for help. Thats straight up bad parenting.

 Not being a part of so-called &#39;Western culture&#39;, I haven&#39;t been exposed to the story of Willy Wonka in my childhood.

Of course, some of them are in these stories because writing a &quot;good&quot; monopoly is easier than portraying the complexities of the market economy.

Some people say that its Wonka himself. Others say its a side effect of whatever project he got into now that his factory is no longer the only thing he focuses on. Nobody knows where the Oompa Loompas came from but him and he&#39;s not telling, and they aren&#39;t human, and they&#39;ve been seen outside the factory at multiple times as agents of the factory. Strange men are often seen around town and are obviously plotting something, but disperse whenever noticed significantly. The town&#39;s economy is only barely hanging on, but danger is beginning to drive people away. And as the chocolate he made became more available, the chocolate that was both considered a luxury item on par with a week&#39;s worth of food and which had planned scarcity to drive up prices, people are starting to realize that something is severely wrong with that chocolate, but of course nobody wants to stop eating it when its a dollar a bar and hersey&#39;s is 2.19.

 Alas, your silly video about how we should all cancel Willy Wonka exploded into perhaps the best video essay I have ever seen on YouTube! Truly, this is a masterful production. It is such a perfect blend of sociological and cultural analysis that is both easily accessible and remarkably entertaining. From the aesthetic and color coordination of the visuals (very much including your own visual ensemble) to the progressive organization that saw Willy Wonka dramatically transcend from Candyman into God, I was enraptured throughout all four acts. You demonstrated, through insightful discussion and scintillating demonstration, how symbols and rituals can create magical candies, wonderous factories, and eccentric billionaires that have the power to both inspire and ruthlessly capture the very spirit of society itself.  After the main performance, your continued discussion reiterated a thesis which was captured beautifully in the performance, but not stated explicitly, which is that the entertainment value of our deconstructions as well as that of our source material cannot be overlooked as we attempt to elevate our collective consciousness. Unfortunately, in a world so saturated with content and information, it would seem nearly impossible to capture anyone&#39;s attention, let alone foster enlightening discussions, without creating exquisite explanations that were also impeccable in the artistry of their presentations. Luckily, your video provides a template. Thank you very much professor. And Brava!

 People saying you&#39;re taking something too seriously because it&#39;s &quot;children&#39;s&quot; literature bothers me so much. If it&#39;s for children, it should be examined that much more seriously. This is when so many life lessons are instilled. (Also people say it all the time about teen and adult lit/film, etc as well.

 When I was a 9 year old, I kept wondering about Veruca being roasted alive. So I eventually had a dream that I (as a computer game helicopter pilot [I was playing SimCopter a lot]) jumped down the chute after her. Well, it went down a chute and into a clear glass tube. Wilder&#39;s Wonka was saying &quot;There&#39;s nothing like PURE GAS-O-LINE...&quot; as the raging furnace was in front of Veruca and myself, with the tube having changed direction horizontally, so we&#39;d be laying down. Wonka then spoke to a Doctor who looked like Mr. Beauregarde;, and Wonka said something that my 9 year old mind thought up; &quot;Doctor, there might be a fire.&quot;<br><br>... Wait, is my recollection of that last line on target? I don&#39;t consciously quite know for sure whether it is or not. <br><br>Oh, and after Wonka&#39;s last line, my Dad went in the chute after me. Then I dreamed I (not as the pilot, but my 9 year old self) told my Mother that yeah, it really did go to a furnace.<br><br>I have other grotesque dreams from when I was about 10 years old, like the blue-skinned guys dream where one guy didn&#39;t want to join, so then one blue guy started murdering the unwilling man with a hatchet.

 Quite an interesting analysis. Your closing lines reminded me of something: There is a kind of person who active oppose media analysis. It&#39;s most common in video games, but it does with other mediums as well.

 I mean, this is not to be eDgY and this is definitely NOT because I&#39;m a salty latine from a colonized country /s but the way you describe Wonka DOES resemble the Christian god of the bible.

But then, there&#39;s tons of other verses that prove this (that I could cite but the platform will just not show my comment, like it&#39;s done many times, maybe bc it gets too long, idk).

 Okay this might be a stretch, but I really want to bring up the Adult Swim show Superjail in response to all of these adaptations- as the character of The Warden appears to bring all of these darker aspects- the capitalist, the trickster, the vengeful god- to the forefront of a Wonka character. The show has its own problematic aspects, but it&#39;s a really neat satirical demonstration of the true nature of Wonka&#39;s character by just putting him in a more outwardly dark and capitalist environment.

 The first movie was one I saw as a kid and I knew I was supposed to love it, but I never liked it much. No moral insight, it just seemed pointless and the Wonka character seemed weirdly random and unfunny. I guess I preferred Harriet the Spy (the book, there was no movie back then).<br><br>But to be honest, as I heard you read out the evil Wonka version of the story, I thought it sounded like a hilariously demented fairy tale. For the first time in my life I thought the story was funny. So that led me to wondering whether some of your interpretations might be unfair, or at least, whether there might be another side to it. For example maybe Charlie is a blank slate simply because it&#39;s easier for kids to identify with. Or maybe the horrific punishments aren&#39;t meant to be seen literally, but rather as symbolic reflections of a child&#39;s way of wrestling with morality and &quot;being bad.&quot; (But the fatphobia&#39;s awful no matter how you look at it.) Etc., etc.<br><br>Of course I&#39;m not saying your interpretation is wrong. But maybe other interpretations are possible as well.

 My youngest kid‚Äôs entry into ‚Äúchapter‚Äù books via self reading was Roald Dahl, starting with, yes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I was happy about it primarily because it set off the intense love of reading that was already well entrenched in her parents and older siblings. But Dahl‚Äôs‚Ä¶problematic aspects did bother me from time to time and I was glad when she embraced other works as she widened her reading horizons. (And yeah, they ended up including Harry Potter too, sigh‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs hardly unusual.)<br><br>But this fantastic and troubling examination has made me think about my own early influences, especially in light of that powerful opening (and repeated) quote, during my childhood in the 60s and early 70s. They included the Oz books, the Great Brain books, All of a Kind Family, Edward Eager‚Äôs magical adventure books and the practicality everything by Zilpha Keatley Snyder. Most importantly were the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander and E. Nesbit‚Äôs Psammead series (5 Children and It, etc.). Both Alexander and Nesbit (and Snyder too) offered a much different kind of sensibility than Dahl, one that involved kindness, ethics and a willingness to grapple with difficult situations without indulging in cruelty or indifference. Nesbit‚Äôs books were a revelation for me as a kid, suggesting that adults weren‚Äôt always helpful or even knowledgeable, and that blind obedience to them wasn‚Äôt necessarily a good thing.<br><br>Some of my beloved books from youth (particularly the Prydain series) are still at the top of my recommend list and hold up decade upon decade. But I‚Äôm also truly grateful for the options kids have now that are broader and ever more thoughtful and meaningful as the crappy privileged cruelties of our unfortunate histories are (all too slowly) discarded. Dahl was absolutely an entertaining writer‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm not sorry to let his ugly viewpoints fade away.

 I am not sure that the reading of Roald Dahl&#39;s work is accurate here. Ronald Dahl was an extremely interesting character (a fighter pilot in WW2, and toward the end of the war, after crashing and sustaining injuries that prevented him from flying again, he was sent to America and became a spy, reporting to Winston Churchill on what was going on in Washington), and I can&#39;t see him producing such a pro-capitalistic book as is suggested here. I think these elements are more likely ironic - something for the parents to get when reading the book to their children, but which the children themselves were unlikely to pick up on. So I think the interpretation of the story and characters is good, but I would argue that Dahl was perhaps implicitly making these points on purpose; not ignorantly promoting capitalism, consumerism, and so forth, but underlying their horrible impact on humanity. 

 	Replies: ['penny for your thots', 'It could be that the pro-capitalist messages are unintended, but it&#39;s also possible that the pro-capitalist reading is supported by evidence in the story because of his other prejudices unintentionally intersecting with capitalism.<br>While its perhaps intentional that he included messages about consumerism and things related to it, he also has a long history of various prejudices (mostly of Jews, but with accusations of sexism and racism as well), and I&#39;m wondering if perhaps his beliefs regarding those works their way into the novel.<br>It&#39;s not uncommon for people to have incomplete understandings of societal problems because of other prejudices they hold. Even a lot of progressives don&#39;t fully understand the intersections between something like class and race, which causes them to unintentionally support policies that reinforce both because they are linked to each other.<br><br>Perhaps dahl had a very good understanding of why capitalism was bad, but his other prejudices led him to characterize certain things within the story that undermine the message he was sending, and unintentionally made it pro-capitalist. I&#39;d have to read the books again to see if there was any textual evidence for this, but it&#39;s entirely possible that both of these things can be true at the same time.<br><br>It&#39;s also possible that he is critical of capitalism, but not necessarily the entire structure of it. Even conservatives who seek to uphold capitalism often criticize it, but give very surface level criticisms of it because they cannot imagine another system. Something similar might have been happening with dahl as well.']

 Unsure if it&#39;s intentional, but it does seem non-coincidental that, of the two movies, the version in the 70s (a time of widespread, near jingoistic support of capitalism in the Cold War), Willie Wonka is depicted as always being in command of the situation and seeming to always be the man with a plan; whereas, in the 2005 version, as the social conscience begins to become a bit more progressive, the movie tends to infantilize the billionaire, making him more of a pitiable than admirable character for a lot of it. I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to make him relatable, so much as trying to make his actions feel less malicious (again, whether that be intentional or conscious or not).<br>Excellent and comprehensive video!

 This isn&#39;t related to the video at all, but uhh my eighth grade english teacher is a huuuge Zoe Bee stan. I&#39;m not in their class anymore, but I still talk to them pretty often, and they always talk about how &quot;I wish she worked here so we could collaborate. I love her ideas about teaching and stuff.&quot;
