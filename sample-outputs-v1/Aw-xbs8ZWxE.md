Description: 
 We explore the precise measurement and machining of small distances and their importance on modern industrial society. The history of the meter and distance measurements are explained as well as intuitive examples of small distances given, moving from mm scales to the realm of microns. Further, we discuss some of the engineering issues that emerge as we try to machine at smaller tolerances such as fitment, assembly, and thermal expansion.

1: New Mind 
 In November of last year, I released a crudely made video on the Science of Small Distances. It was kind of a half hobby, half experimental effort and I had never expected more than a few hundred people to ever watch it. I still recall the excitement of hitting my first 500 subscribers from that video. And here were are, one year later, 138k subscribers strong and a silver play button fresh in hand. I can&#39;t begin to express how grateful I am for all the support you guys have given me. It&#39;s been an amazing adventure and I&#39;m so thrilled to be sharing it with such an incredible and knowledgeable audience. I thank you all. <br><br>As the channel grew over the past year, I&#39;ve always wanted to redo that first video that set everything in motion; refine the quality a bit, USE METRIC UNITS!, etc. I can&#39;t think of a more appropriate time than now - I present to you my anniversary remake of The Science of Small Distances.

I was glad that meters were used. Then had a moment of surprise when you used Fahrenheit as a measure of temperature. 😅', 'KelelaSB', 'I&#39;d love to see a video called something like The Practice of Small Distances that would show how the hell the automakers can produce zillions of ICE&#39;s with ~1 micron tolerances, given how challenging this video showed the task of machining to be at that scale.']

 yup thermal expansion (and contraction...) are real things that a lot of people don&#39;t really think about.  I just got through machining a special tool.  It&#39;s al aluminum outer sleeve that fits over a hardened steel inner shaft (bearing installation tool).  When I cut the aluminum, I bored and measured.  Last cut came out to .0005&quot; oversize which is about where I wanted it.  Slid it onto the steel shaft.  In seconds it became STUCK.  I failed to take into consideration the expansion rate difference between the two different alloys.  Just heated the aluminum a little and it slid right off.  This expansion is something that many don&#39;t really think about much when they go hammering on their engines when cold, particularly aluminum block engines.  Titanium rod engines are similar.  Aluminum rod engines....oh boy...don&#39;t even get me started on those.  Some types of racing, the engine parts are mostly seized when cold and require an artificial warming up (heaters, etc) for the clearances to open up.

 For a while I worked at a facility that manufactured bottling slip sheets. It&#39;s a thin sheet of plastic used in the bottling process. Our tolerances was +/-1.5 thousandth of an inch. My job was checking them every hour over 10 times a day. By the end I could pretty much tell how thick it was just by hand and sight. Using the actual tool was just to see how close I got and as a double check.

 I work at an engine factory. Sometimes we analyse engines that ran for 600.000 km, and yet, there were absolutely no contact marks between a crankshaft and its journal bearing.

 About hand tools. You design to a millimeter. You cut to the pencilmark (which could easily be less than a half millimeter). And then a really good craftsman can make it flush with another part up to about 0.1mm. Whether it&#39;s half a millimeter bigger or smaller than designed, nobody can tell. But the parts will fit perfectly and this is a matter of intuition for someone who can hone himself as well as his tools.

I prefer metric in everyone except day to day temperature measurement. Fahrenheit is just better related to a human scale than Celsius, more granular as well.

 You are somewhat right, with injectionmoulding 0.01mm is a common tolerance between parts, and going into injectionmoulding with silicone you would have a leak with that gap.

Alot of mobilephone and computer parts, medicine etc have a insane tolerance, superseeding engine specs somethimes.<br><br>As a toolmaker i work daily with tolerances below 0.01mm on my manual machines.

 i regularly fit parts with  10 thou shrink horizontally by hand no guides except sometimes a  rolling chair. or the gantry crane if its a huge shaft but thats vertically. if you are using heat to fit parts in an ideal setting do your best to have a very flat workbench or floor with a stop if its a through fit without a shoulder of some kind, the parts being fitted to be oriented vertically, measuring your fit directly before your attempted fit and as soon as the part starts to slide just DROP it or if using a crane just drop as quickly as possible. (if its with a crane the weight should keep it going down. keep a 30lb piece of brass or like a 2in dia aluminum and a big hammer to please the machinist gods just in case it decides to get stuck or cocked as it falls, if you are fast enough a light tap on the high side can usually let it fall the rest of ther way, however if it doest i like to go in a pattern of a top, bottom, left, right, pounding it down till it sounds different. you only get like 2 rotations if your fast enough before youd have to call itquits and let ity cool down to then reheat to press or remove and try it all over. and hopefully not mar or destroy the parts. Bearings however shouldnt be done in anyway that could introduce debris or dirt into them so press with an induction heater is ideal.

 Once again, throwing the British Imperial Units under the bus. I like both the Imperial Units and SI Units, but for some reason there has been a fostered hatred for both and a strong defense by those whom deem their units more superior. It&#39;s quite sad, honetly, since they both get the job done. For me, SI is good for the science community as a whole, I will admit that. SI are easier to work with when it comes to small-scale stuff and volumes. However, I find the Imperial Units good for things like weight, height, and length measurements. It&#39;s easier for me to quantify an inch or foot, than it is a centimeter or meter, but in the end it really comes down to whatever unit of measurement you grew up with. As I said, both can get the job done, and I&#39;m not here to argue which is the overall &quot;best of the best.&quot;

 It is really interesting to see this. I do Architectural Drawings from Hand and I can draw in 0.1 mm increments. I also worked many years with ethernet cables and other telecommunication cables. Those are small distances I am quite comfortable to work with. I also worked with Fiber Cables and to work with these is really hard, especially if you’re on a construction side. „Melting“ two fiber cables together takes time. While the „melting“ is done by a machine, you still need to free up every single fiber, cut them properly and insert them. This work was always „too small“ for my likings.<br><br>For example, a typical Singlemode Fiber is 0.009 mm thick. I had to make them free, clean them, cut them and put them in the placeholder by hand.

 And once you get down to about the 5 nanometer scale you encounter a whole new problem far beyond temperature and fit - the thickness of the material is so thin even electrons can pass through them and &quot;leak out&quot;. This means the material is no longer able to hold or transfer a charge through it. It&#39;s the biggest limiting factor of making computer components even smaller and our ability to truly create nano-computers. And we&#39;re already getting close to this limit (we&#39;re down to around 7 nanometers now).<br>It&#39;s also the scale at which the tiny molecular machinery inside every cell exists at, where this &quot;flaw&quot; of electrons leaking through is actually used as a tool that makes the very processes of a cell work.

 I can tell you as a gunsmith, it baffles most people that a well made fire arm has part fitment with tolerances tighter than a human hair. For example when head spacing a gun.

 good video, but when you say that alignment is impossible at the very tight tolerances by hand only, you are wrong.  I am a retired toolmaker/machinist.  There are many of us that can align pin and corresponding hole with 0.0001&quot; or  2.54 microns by hand and do so almost on a daily basis.  We help ourselves do this with a feature on the hole and pin called a chamfer.  Typically a 45 degree break on the edge of each which is self centering.

 Regarding the historical definition of the meter.<br>1) I never liked the definition of 1/10,000,000 the longitudinal distance from equator to north pole through Paris.  The whole point of the metric system was to get away from nationalism in order to standardize, and they immediately run to Paris as the standard.<br>  <br>2) The original definition of a meter was actually different than what you have here.  Before that definition there was a different one.  The length of a pendulum that took 1 second to swing.  The reason they didnt stay with this definition is because gravity fluctuates across the planet, so this length would technically be slightly different depending on where you were.  Since they wanted to get away from any nationalism to define a universal standard, they abandoned this definition that depended so much on locality.  So naturally and hypocritically they revamped the definition so that  it centered around Paris France.

 Great video!<br>A friend of mine was a machinist his whole life. He has a block of steel on his desk. It looks like just a block of steel. If you push on the center, a cloverleaf will push out. I forget the tolerance he said it was, but you cannot see it! He said it was done on some sort of wire machine submersed in water….he explained it to me but I had the deer in the headlight look when he was finished lol<br>I’m used to using plastiguage for bearings, and some stuff I work with .3mm.

 Now you can see why machinist drink after work. It is easy for a designer to put close tolerances on a set of plans that in the finished real life use of the part did not need to be that close, the time of holding tight tolerances cost the customer more money.Crankshaft bearings need 1 1/2 thousands clearance for oil and heat expansion, before detergent oil the loss of bearing materiel was replaced with varnish and the oil pressure stayed the same. Now without varnish, a heaver oil is needed as the bearings ware out. Non detergent engine oil is ellegal in CA.

 Grandad retired from being a machinist in 94 I think.  Long before he retired he was working a machine that would get thrown out of tolerance when they opened the door to bring in material. They tried to only open the door at the start of the day and right after lunch. But someone would eventually need more material. He would  just quit working let them come in and out then go back to work.  The lathe I think wouldn’t get turned off but just sit and spin

 Hey, great stuff! I went to school for &quot;engineering drafting and design&quot;. Where I lived they didn&#39;t need people with 4 year degrees that still didn&#39;t know how to draw so the local college tailored it&#39;s curriculum to the work in the area. Important things like like fits, tolerances, metallurgy, material selection and most importantly, Computer Aided Drafting were of course covered but we also had to take the entire machine tool operations sequence which was the same sequence for a &quot;journeyman machinist&quot; might have to take. Many complained &quot;I&#39;m not going to work in a dirty shop&quot;, not realizing that it would make us better designers. In fact, if it wasn&#39;t for that sequence we never would have qualified for the jobs in the area detail draftsman and designers. I soaked up everything in college I could like a sponge. I took other cad classes that used different programs, &quot;hydraulics and pneumatics&quot;...whatever I could take that might allow me to be employable at a variety of shops. It worked. I didn&#39;t plan on working as a machinist in a welding shop but when layoff time came I needed the job. Unemployment didn&#39;t pay the bills! LOL  I was taught mostly in inches because from the rollers at the steel mill to the finished sheets and bars, everything was in inches. You could special order hard Metric but only a couple of sizes might be on the shelf or could be had quickly. So, to this day, when someone starts talking in Metric, my eyes gloss over and I start looking for my calculator.

 The meter does not mean squat to anyone but an Earthling. Why can’t we use a unit of measurement based on the most common element in the universe, hydrogen? My issue with the meter is well the meter. A foot is so handy. A third of a meter is close to a foot but it’s is not commonly used. Nautical miles is a very good and practical measurement which because it is based on Earth measurement and time, the world will continue its use forevermore. Please note, I am not debating the practically of a base ten system. Even those die hard inchers have succumbed to the 1/1000 of an inch method of accuracy. I would much rather reach for a 15mm rather than it’s inch equivalent. I do appreciate you educating folks on where the meter originated. Most don’t have a clue. The metric system is superior as it ties distances, weights and volumes together in a nice predictable package. But seriously a distance based on the wavelength of hydrogen would be dandy when the aliens come to call.

Nothing ever changes about a circle any more then if you were to capture it as image from far or close as it is the value of the lens that determines the size of an object;  for instance;  if you were to learn that our universe is just an atom type of object within the eye of similar type of environment;  which surely does have no choice of occurring as far as sizes go;  but not necessarily that chromosomes would have had or has or shall be/been create(d).  But my point is that if you think that our &quot;light ?speed?&quot; is fast;  imagine that the same thing is actually happening within as large of scale as you can try to find a measurement for it;  my point is that sizes are relevant as measurements that differ between the size of the looking glass. Cheers.  Our energies are moving just as slow as the rest of it all.  There are likely things that move so fast;  that we don&#39;t realise that they exist.  LOL Hope this was entertaining for some of you.

 I cut the Heads for one of the Auto Companies.....I cut the 6.2LT4 for the Corvette ( figure out what company..lol). Have over a Decade doing this job exclusively and from my experience.......  <br>Out of say 175 Heads cut in 8 hrs the measurements of any certain hole WILL BE OVAL. the X and Y Axis of the measurement are very rarely the same. Can pull 5 Heads and check. .. will find hole A, B,C and D are all 1 or 2 microns  wider at X Axis.  These are cut with Diamond cutting tools with a life of 300 or less life expectancy ( Heads cut).<br>Not only Axis but actual measurements from Head 1 to 100 and 101 to 300 are different.  The wearing of the cutting edge also gives you a smaller diameter of the cut Hole. Example...XX0009 with first Head to XX0003 with last Head.<br><br>The tolerances are extreme.  Hate having to pull a set of tools..(4)  and then replace them. Not only changing of tools, but the hand Check and Zeiss measurements,  but also the surface check is needed. ...and you can check the same Head in 4 different machines that measure to the Micron and receive 4 different measurements.  Run the same Head 4 times in same machine and receive 4 different measurements... all 1 or 2 microns in difference for this or that Hole.....<br>I guess what I&#39;m saying is.....even though care is used, the best tools are used, the best measuring machine is used....a perfect circle is rare....not the rule.  An exact sized Hole from cut 1 to cut 300 will not happen.  <br>If your variation is an allowance of say 40 microns....easy. but when it&#39;s less than say 8 it&#39;s not. <br>When the difference of 1 micron determines if the Head is suitable or not is impossible...unless at say.....<br>The Head passes atXX0012  and fails at XX0013.....which does happen.

 Cars are so unbelievably unreliable when compared to machines in the general industry.

And 5000 hours also isn&#39;t much. that&#39;s just over 208 days or, if the machine would be started on Jan 1st of the year, it would be done by the 28th of august and would have needed many inspections and repairs, halting production in a frequency that no business could sustain. <br><br>and to give you an example that we could do better if we wanted to, the Huge haul trucks that work in mines, the ones where the tire is twice your size or even bigger, get their first INSPECTION after 50.000 hours. not that anything is expected to be broken at this point. it&#39;s just the first time someone checks if everything is still up to spec. cars last a 10th of that, with many breakdowns and repairs in between. <br><br>Cars are laughable, they really are something to scoff at

 Incorrect about the audio wires, fiber optic cables core is very thin and transmits pulses of light, and the protective part of the cable is plastics and other materials and make the cable thick to protect the fiber. Cable for audio is typically made of copper and much thicker around or a little bigger than a pencil led. What you showed is a RJ 45 jack and they are made in different ways not going into it, the wire you see is probably gold plated and is only used on part of the connectors.

 A fellow named Graham Hancock figured out that the Great Pyramid has several important proportions built into it.  The most impressive measurement is that of the Precession of the Earth.  One full revolution though this wobble takes 26,000 years and there is no way a civilization that has cubits as its measuring unit could calculate this and they did not build the Pyramids either.  The Earth had an advanced group of beings who built all these monolithic structures.  You can read about them in the book of Enoch.

 Yea. About that fit, in our high school, we deal with 0.001mm practically every day. Just 2 days ago, I had to mill ridge 20H8. That means 20mm, H tolerance is +- and the 8 is specific value. And I milled it about 19,8mm, and then by hand filing, with help of cilinder calibre with the exact 20H8 tolerance, I fit it perfectly. And surprisingly, its nothing hard, it just sounds crazy at first 😅

 Hey there!  I am a retired engine machinist who ground thousands of crankshafts and bored and honed thousands of engine blocks, as well as piston pins and bushings etc. I saw the first video on this, and remember seeing some information that was a bit off.  I have been subbed since, and have been watching your videos. Their quality and the information quality have been getting phenomenal!  You have a really good skill there.  Keep it up!  As you went smaller in dimensions in this video, I kept comparing the information to what my experience told me, and everything was really, really accurate.  I saw one tiny flaw, and maybe others mentioned it, but piston pins DO have a clearance fit, of about .007mm, so they do slip together at room temperature, although, as you said earlier in the video, it takes a bit of skill to line them up well.  In most engines, the cast iron connecting rod bore end is heated to allow the pin to slide through, and it clamps on with great force when it cools.  In a lot of diesels and industrial engines, the connecting rods have a bushing in them which also has the .007mm clearance honed in, (rather than the interference fit), and in these situations, clips are fit into grooves in the piston on either end of the pins to keep them from sliding all the way out.  You may already know all this too, but I got talking.....  anyway, great job!  I would LOVE to be able to make videos like this, but I seem to be stuck on learning how to do animation.  I think it&#39;s just a matter of &#39;drive&#39;.

 Nobody has a foot that long.  It is very obvious that the &quot;foot&quot; was not based on the size of a human foot.

 I like how a meter is based on the speed of light, which is now known to be variable, and so to correct this they made the speed of light a statute speed and not the natural variable one. 

 	Replies: ['Paul Frederick', 'The speed of light in a vacuum is constant.', 'Jason Hamilton', 'I&#39;ve read Planck and I think he had things well thought thru. Einstein agreed with him and Tesla about there being something in vacuum. We found a working model of quantum, and the various divisions in physics today are still struggling with strings or bands or whatever mechination they need to envision an ether model. I&#39;m not even saying that the speed of light isn&#39;t fixed per se. It could just be that the energy state of the fabric of the universe is somehow changed and the speed of causality is becoming perceived as slower. Don&#39;t know that one way or another. I just know what gets published, and when you see a bunch of topics all noticing different things you can only conjecture until a means of determining the truth is obtained. The math does point to something along these lines and maintains conservation of energy. But, I can&#39;t say conservation of energy is 100% because the latest work points strongly to white holes being a thing now. I&#39;m just waiting for someone to find one, and then I&#39;ll be able to get all that free electrical service that people want so much. Ps. If you want to disprove an opinion on YouTube go and publish a paper on the journal Science or something. The fact is, I hardly believe half of what these YouTube creators put up anyway, because what I read in the peer reviewed writings is amazing and this stuff is like a decade behind. And, most of the published findings took a decade to pass review.', 'VoxelFusion', 'I suppose you didn&#39;t hear &quot;speed of light *in a vacuum*&quot;. The speed of light changes depending on the medium it&#39;s passing through, that&#39;s why saying vacuum is important, since that is the fastest light travels, matching the speed of causality.', 'Jordan Rodrigues', '&gt;  the speed of light, which is now known to be variable, <br><br>Wait, what?  Some googling shows theoretical work, but that&#39;s the kind of extraordinary claim that needs serious evidence to support it.  And about the closest I could find was some of the things discussed here.<br><br><a href="https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/is-the-speed-of-light-slowing-down">https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/is-the-speed-of-light-slowing-down</a><br><br><br>The constant &quot;c&quot; <b>is</b> &quot;fixed by statute,&quot; but that&#39;s due to some mind-bending mathematics. All measurement is comparison and you can&#39;t measure &quot;c&quot; without comparing light to something.  As long as the meter was defined by a special bar of metal, then &quot;c&quot; would be changed by  a fingerprint on that metal!  Math doesn&#39;t have a strong opinion on whether the laws of the universe changed or the prototype changed, any more than a balance having an opinion whether one pan is too heavy or the other is too light. <br>If you believe that the laws  of the universe are more reliable than a prototype, then defining a physical constant to have a fixed value is simply what you do.  The international community of measurement scientists (a truly nerdy group) did that.  (The fixed value is chosen in a  best effort to be consistent with historical measurements.)<br>So if the speed of light is variable, the current definition of our units of measurement will handle that by varying other physical constants.  &quot;Variable speed of light&quot; is still a useful concept for designing experiments, but if that phenomenon is found and explained, the explanation will likely result in a new definition of units of length or time.  If not, it will have to deal with variability of the gravitational constant.<br><br><br>(The linked article talks about the planck length and time.  Those constants are defined from pi (mathematically defined), c (defined by statute), planck&#39;s constant (defined by statute since last May), and G.  So it would have to be the gravitational constant.)']
