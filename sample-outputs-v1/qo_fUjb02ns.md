 I just want to say that this is absolutely NOT industrial-scale scraping. You will not use puppeteer for industrial scale scraping. It&#39;s too heavy, you&#39;d also not use Brightdata as a service for industrial scale scraping. This is just one big advertisement with a clickbait title.

 Also for any site doing SSR or not full CSR rendering (which I&#39;m betting Amazon as used in the example does SSR even if they have some CSR) using Puppeteer at all is overkill. <br><br>Also Playwright is a good secondary option, I haven&#39;t tried it yet but the original Puppeteer devs left and started Playwright instead, which also supports more browsers while Puppeteer is Chromium or Chrome only

 And you should have demonstrated using XPath for selecting rather than a simple ceeessess selector

 ..while Puppeteer can run headless, you don&#39;t have to run it headless. It may still seem headless from what most might consider that term to mean but headless or not is a config option for Puppeteer, running with headless disabled can help beat bot detection sometimes.

 Puppeteer is the source of non stop memory leak nightmares for me. Fortunately I got it down to under like 30mb a day but originally it was like 30mb per leak and like 250+mb a day leaked (and it was mostly only loading 2 pages back and forth)

 Could I use web scraping to automate account creation? <br><br>I work for a dental insurance company. Any time a new member service rep (MSR) is hired, we have to manually create an &quot;medicaid&quot; (but not medicaid) account for those member service reps. The worst part about it, is that for each MSR account, we have to sign into multiple accounts to give them access to different things. <br><br>For instance, an admin account called &quot;1&quot;, I have to create the MSR account and provide access. Then, I sign out and sign into another admin account called &quot;2&quot; and provide access for the MSR account. Then, I sign out and sign into admin account &quot;3&quot; and provide access for the MSR account. There&#39;s about 11 admin accounts that we have to switch through to provide each new hire with the proper access. It is very time consuming and tedious.

 As a web scraping tool developer, one thing to note about the chatGPT code about extracting product names etc is that it&#39;s not going to work on all cases. What I mean by that is we can see there are some random class names like &#39;._cDEzb&#39;. And these classes can vary from page to page. So your code for one listing page, might not work for other. The way I do this is using some advanced query selectors that don&#39;t rely on unreliable classes. Can go into more detail if required.

 This is cool but honestly not a good thing to teach for these purposes. Scraping can be very cool and totally legit for certain uses but this isn&#39;t a good idea.

 Don&#39;t suppose ya want to do a python based version of this for ya boi? xD I already have enough headache learning python, machine learning(scikit-learn, etc), statistics, algebra, calculus, neural networks, all the tools involved with them and etc to learn JavaScript on top of everything ü•¥üòµ‚Äçüí´. I usually just watch your videos for entertainment (not that I don&#39;t learn anything you are just actually funny as <b>insert favourite verb*) but this one is actually so relevant and useful for me I had to ask, hell I&#39;d pay for it *shakes wallet as a 14/7 student only for dust somehow capable of laughing at me to fall out</b> üòÖ lol no, true story but I actually would pay for that (true obviously referring to wallet dust laughing at me). Probably easier ways for me to figure this out but like I said literally no joke studying 14 hours a day 7 days a week most weeks x.x <br><br>I have a basic foundational knowledge of web scraping with Python btw, though I have used it  more to crash my friends sites like a janky McGuivere&#39;d DDoS than actually scraping at this point lol. I am a quick study tho, I only started learning programming at all less than 2 months ago and am already capable of writing programs and pretty decent with machine learning. Didn&#39;t have any real experience beforehand but I am not really new to the general concepts. Also have an IQ higher than both your grandma&#39;s ages put together, which is usually pretty meaningless honestly (literally 99% of the people I know with legitimate IQs over 120 are the stupidest idiots I know, and I am definitely one of them) but in this case it means I am adapted with high intuition and logical reasoning, so explaining completely fresh concepts to me is relatively easy even despite my debatably brain damaged self. Would be happy to discuss some kind of incentive to create that video, (more likely than not research or writing assistance since I can&#39;t rly offer much other than my talent üòÖ) or if you&#39;re just down even better lol. I&#39;ll ship you some legal Canadian weed in an encyclopedia on local government procedural history, ain&#39;t no one spending a femtosecond investigating that sheez lol. (Jk but also not jk? Doubt you&#39;d wana share your shipping details but if there is something from Canada/Quebec/Montreal your interested in I would be happy to send it over or at least pay for it and have you order it yourself. If you drink got literally dozens of family owned breweries within like 30km of me, there&#39;s food you can only get in Canada, idk but if you do make the video by my request id feel obligated to gift ya something lol. One stereotype bout Canadians that def isn&#39;t true is we.... At least look polite next to Americans üòÖ <b>Vietnam flashback to any-and-every time driving in Quebec</b> <br>People often ask me what the differences are between French and Quebec French, and my legitimate honest answer is always multiply the swearing by triple-infinity, lol. True story there was literally a battle in WW2 where a regiment of French Canadians ran towards a German trench swearing and the massively outnumbering soliders surrendered out of pure terror because almost every single swear is related to god or church so all they saw was crazy ass Canadians known for savagery, ruthlessness, war crimes and taking no prisoners running at them with no care for their well being while singing and swearing at god xD. Yeah btw before you assume all Canadians will be nice and polite to you no matter what you do, maybe look up our history in war, lol, idk how tf we got stereotyped as nice and polite tbh, were just not blatantly rude because the people we often associate with don&#39;t give us reasons to be. That history might make ya second think being rude next time you visit Canada and save yourself from loosing a tooth. The reason guns are legal here yet nobody really thinks of them as self defence tools is cuz we ain&#39;t no <b>insert derogatory term here</b> and even our 8 year olds will drop hands with you and probably win lol. <br><br>Wowww that was a pretty bad tangent even for me. üòÖ Sorry I have ADD (actually) and my medication is basically... Wait no in my case is literally just speed lol legal for the record but still literally just a mix of amphetamine and dexamphetamine lol.... Wtf was my point? Oh yeah I don&#39;t usually take it so when I need to catch up on something and do it kinda hits me hard, which leads to unadulterated absurdity usually, like my goddamn brain needed to think faster and more sporadically &gt;.&gt;  <br><br>(What does high IQ mean?; It means I&#39;m smart enough to be dumb enough to be smart enough to think that it&#39;s smart to be dumb and believe high IQ means I have extra braincells to lose and can drink more without caring about repercussions üòÖ. Not sure where I landed on that obviously genius boolean response? Me neither cuz IQ is usually fkn stupid and meaningless, is really just an indicator of how stupid the people giving you the test think you are and are themselves. Just shut up and üçª cause spending time on that shit is meaningless and unless you score less than 80 or more than 150, so are IQ tests. I basically just mean &quot;I am not dumb&quot; and &quot;can learn even brand new concepts quickly&quot; when I say it. If someone flexes their IQ on you just hit back with &quot;oh okay, but even with your high IQ your not smart enough to know how meaningless that score actually is? Which test exactly convinced you that you were smarter than the idiot the idiot who wrote the test wrote it for? I may only be some average IQ pleb like the writers of 99% of scientific papers, but it seems to me that you don&#39;t even know what your own claim even means bud.&quot; üòÅ If that doesn&#39;t leave em speechless idk what will.) <br><br>Mmm... This rly became a clusterfrack, maybe drinking whiskey at 12pm on a weekday is a bad idea.... Hmmm.... naaaah üçª. (I genuinely apologize for what this turned into üòÖ I would use the fact I&#39;m sick, on my pharmaceutical speed and legit drunk cuz I felt so bad I decided screw it if I was gona feel so crap anyways mine as well feel like crap and drunk. .... I had no but to that lol)

 Remote browser as a service is actually a genius idea.
