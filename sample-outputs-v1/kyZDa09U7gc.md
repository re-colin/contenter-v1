Description: 
 The year 2000 was going to be very special, for a multitude of reasons. We were entering into a new millennium, a new era, a year that only existed in Science-Fiction stories. This was by no means a conventional New Year. It was finally the future, but maybe not the future everyone was anticipating. Millions of people around the world spent their last moments in the 1900s staring at the clock, but not for the reason that you think. Instead of celebrating, they were terrified, because as soon as the clock struck midnight, the world was going to end, and within the blink of an eye, the year 2000 would instead be a future now past.
Word had been going around about this upcoming event for years now. The public even coined a name for this phenomenon: Y2K, and as the late 1990s creeped up and the year 2000 approached, people crowded up stores across the world and lined up to buy food, water, weapons, and supplies to create survival kits, because on this date, according to many credible sources, computers would malfunction, prison gates would open, dams would flood, banks would lose all their money, nuclear missiles would launch by themselves. They did this because they were told the end was year, but why? What exactly caused such a strange worldwide panic like this one, to arise? If the year 2000 was so dangerous, how are we still here?
To fully understand the curious story behind Y2K and how it was able to cause such the level of panic that it did, we first need to discuss what exactly all of it means. To be clear, world ending predictions were by no means a new thing, but no this was something different. Y2K wasn‚Äôt just some Armageddon story made up by conspiracy theorists, this was actually something that might have validity to it, and many people at the time took note of this, and prepared for the worst. And that‚Äôs exactly what made Y2K such a crazy story. In fact, there were three big things going on in the 20th century, and especially the 90s, that were responsible for the Y2K scare: the exponential growth of technology, the ambiguity and mystique that was present behind the brand new personal computer, and the overwhelming access of information that the world saw at the end of the century. And these factors also tie into the origins of the Y2K story; so what exactly was the story, how did Y2K work? The answer to this question actually goes farther back than you might think. The first known mention of Y2K as a legitimate issue goes back to 1958, discovered by an IBM employee: Bob Bemer, who was also one of the most renowned computer scientists of the 20th century. He proposed his idea during a time where computers were still brand new, a lavish and costly byproduct of World War II, but with time, these machines could become incredibly sophisticated and part of our everyday lives, and he recognized this. In 1958, memory was extremely expensive, and naturally to save money while maximizing efficiency, they removed what they thought was redundant information. And that‚Äôs what Y2K was centered on, it all had to do with how numbers were presented on a clock; that‚Äôs where the term Y2K comes from, abbreviating ‚ÄúYear 2000.‚Äù You see, computers at the time only took the last two digits of a year into account when calculating the date, having the ‚Äú1-9‚Äù at the beginning of each set of digits just used up more memory than was worth. The last two digits were more than fine. It is not like people were looking at these computers to see what year it was anyway, it was used for logging and record keeping, and the last two digits were plenty for that. There were even some computers that only used one digit to represent the year: so instead of 1978 you just had 8. I mean everyone knew it was still the 20th century‚Ä¶but what would happen as we approached the 21st century? Well naturally, the year 2000 would have to be represented as 00, but how would a computer that only stores the last two digits of a year react to that? Would it read as 100, or would it backtrack and read it as 0, and slowly tick back up as the year‚Äôs progress? Is the year 2001, or 1901?

 The <b>COVID-19</b> was pretty much the contemporary of <b>Y2K</b> forgetting the obvious <i>virtual/real</i> differences about the Y2K bug and the  Coronavirus, let‚Äôs look at them both:<br><br>- They were massively overhyped about their actual danger and the damage they may cause.<br><br>- Both impacted directly a very limited amount of people (compared to the worldwide population).<br><br>- It was mostly an economic concern, over the worldwide catastrophic event it was pictured to be.<br><br>With that we take in consideration the limited amount of programmers that were involved in the debug process of the <i>Y2K bug</i> and the researchers that were involved in the <i>COVID-19 vaccine,</i> both were vital to eradicating them in the long run.

 Everyone needs to pay attention to this apocalyptic prophecy. It isn&#39;t the first or the last time people have fallen into hysteria. Humans are prone to latch onto these world ending scenarios. NEVER take these kinds of &quot;world/humanity ending crises&quot; seriously.

 I think ppl forget that there were tons of ppl working to fix the bug since the late 80s. There was an old magazine article that got recycled around around the mid to late 90s that caused panic. You can find old articles about Y2K before the panic even emerged into mainstream media. The bug still happens today every once in a while. <br><br>It‚Äôs 2023 and I worked some where that still used tech from the 90s, they literally run new software on old tech and it crashes all the time. It‚Äôs so frustrating that companies don‚Äôt want to update tech because they want to save money &amp; believe me these businesses can afford it too, but companies using old tech &amp; not upgrading /updating it is more common than a lot of ppl realize.

 The Y2K bug was an issue  but it wasn&#39;t what it was made out to be the electric companies <br>Computers weren&#39;t capable of shutting down the entire power grid  prison gates don&#39;t open by a computer at a set time  the only computer programs that could have caused issues would be the be the banks computers  and possibly wall Street  unscrupulous people and companies made tens of trillions of dollars off Y2K (read as y2krock of shit) panic buying<br>It could be argued that without the people panicking companies more than likely wouldn&#39;t have upgraded the computers until they started having actual physical break downs due to simply living they&#39;re lifespan  that being said Y2K was mostly a hoax with an actual basis in reality

 Yeah, I was 29 in 1999 when the whole world was going on and on about the Y2K bug. I completely ignored it. Civilisation had existed for thousands of years and it wasn&#39;t going to end because of 2 x 00&#39;s kicking over on 31.12.1999. Plus, my older brother was a computer programer/systems analyst (still is and has been since 1985. He sold his first code age 15 on the defunct Microbee computer). He let me know the reality of the situation. I celebrated new years eve as usual and watched the midnight fireworks on Sydney Harbour. The good ole days. .

 I never gave Y2K serious credence. Folks would ask why I didn&#39;t think anything would come of it, and I&#39;d say,  &quot;Two words: Bill Gates.

 I was about 11 during y2k, the news was people constantly worrying about what could happen. Some people literally thought people would die on the day for many reasons. Coincidentally my computer had the bug and it only affected one program. I had a friend in University who worked on repairing and upgrading for the bug, he was an incredibly interesting person.

 As someone who DID witness the year 2000 hoopla I can tell you most of the things he was talking about were true. They were calling for planes to be falling out of the sky, major blackouts, people to be trapped in elevators , etc, etc.<br>My brother worked for a bank and laughed at the whole affair till he found himself working lots of overtime getting ready for it.<br>Myself , I found that at midnight I was at home working on my house and at the big switch - over the power didn&#39;t even flicker and nothing appeared to change.<br>I noticed that my toilet tank was seeping water pressure through the valve after midnight as I think the water company probably had to switch something to manual override or something making the pressure a little higher.<br>The biggest thing I noticed was that my 1998 computer, one that was set up for four - digit year and should have been set for the change over,  after midnight 2000 without even being connected to internet <br>( dial up days ) the date on my computer went to a totally random wrong date.<br>Like April 10 , 2012 or something like that. All by itself.<br>Why would my computer do such a thing?<br>I think it was programmed in advance to scramble the date on Y2K

 In some sense I feel blessed to experience that final 20th century hysteria over the unknown. There‚Äôs still hysteria over the unknown now but somehow it feels like we have more of a grasp on it, or at least less fear in general. <br>My dad would always say we will do nothing for Y2K. He said the gas lines will blow up and burn us in our sleep. Nice to tell an 8 year old. Anyway, I ended up going to a friend‚Äôs house for New Year‚Äôs Eve 1999, and we had a blast and forgot the whole thing for the final hour. After 12 we suddenly heard fireworks and my friend jumped up like OMG I FORGOT!! IS Y2K HAPPENING?! His mom goes ‚ÄúNooo sit down, didn‚Äôt you just see the NY ball drop on tv? They‚Äôre fine and so are we‚Äù. <br>But I remember the oddities. The panic at the Costco, the Best Buy and Fry‚Äôs stickers all over saying update your computer before 12/31/99 and people panic pulling money from the ATMs. Creepy though how some of that repeated for the pandemic.<br>The other funny thing I think is how in 1958 I think they thought logically it would be updated by 2000. I have the short term experience of imagining that in 2007, by 2023, we shouldn‚Äôt be seeing Windows XP anymore. Well‚Ä¶

 I was almost 34 when this happened. My girlfriend and I were so worried we went to bed early and did nothing leading up to it different from any other day. Your not far enough removed from 1999 to get people to believe your bullshite story. Sure, maybe 2% of the population might have acted like you said. But this story is mostly bull. And fake news wasn&#39;t a thing or a problem before we got such a trashy lying P.O.S. POTUS. And when Cronkite did the news, lying on the news was against the law. Like it should be again. Especially after entire news channels who do nothing but lie caused so many deaths lying during Covid.

 Now that i think of it, when the world ends does everyone just start a new life at a new universe? Like, isnt there multiple universes?<br>I know this isnt related but aren‚Äôt souls immortal? Or will technology just expand the life of the universe? Probably not, i like to think every universe has a different but similar solar system to this solar system. There might be a new earth in a new universe, everyone will be monkeys and then evolve into humans, and then we could probably get a exact copy of the earth in the uh dead universe with the dead solar system.

 In retrospect it seems silly, but I can attest to how scary it was in the moment. I was 14 when the 1st of 2000 hit, but it was such a big deal even elementary school children at least knew something was up. I remember sitting quietly, alone, waiting to see if something would happen. The power going out was my &quot;sign&quot; to worry. It&#39;s not like I could do anything proactive, though. I was a kid and my family was way too broke to horde food and supplies. It was tense, but it was over so quickly the relief was jarring.

 there never was a bug it was just a big con to get money out of people having their computers tested.<br><br>i say con because it focused on the two digits 99 and said when the millennium comes it will go from 99 to 00 and the computers will crash.<br>what they failed to say was there are another two digits that hold the 19 of 1999 so the computer reads this as 19-99 and when the millennium comes and the 99 goes to 00 the 19 will go to 20 making the year 2000 or 20-00 in computer speak, most anyone in information technology should have known this from day one, i certainly did but i am no one important so who is going to listen to me.<br><br>when we are likely to see a problem is the year 9999 but i am sure most computers will have been updated to cope with this by then, not too much of a worry anyway as its a very long way off.

 The maximum value for a 32-<br>bit signed integer is 2147483647, which in seconds, is a bit over 68 years. The Unix epoch starts from January 1, 1970 at<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZDa09U7gc&amp;t=00m00s">00:00</a>, and counts seconds since then.<br>Since 1970 + 68 = 2038, it is 2038. Once<br>the counter reaches 2147483647, it will overflow, and becomes -2147483648, setting it back to 1901. Most modern computers with a modern OS shouldn&#39;t experience this bug though.<br>However, in January 1 of this year, some microsoft exchange servers stopped working because they stored the date as YYMMDDHHMM, and when year 2022 came around, 2201010000 overflowed the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer, as the servers were still using 32 bit integers instead of 64 bits for some reason.

And same with my two IBM 8088s witch probably also use only 2 digits for counting the years?  <br>I also saw many softwares that was sold as &quot;Y2K safe&quot; at the time, but i guess that only was to earn money from scared people? <br><br>Anyways, computers elder then 2000 just works fine up to this date and will still do in the future without any updates for Y2K

 y2k wasn&#39;t going to happen, it was based on the fear of change, we had never been used to years without the number &quot;1&quot; to start us off, so that could have been a reason<br><br>similarly, people believed 2012 was the end of us because, like the Y2K scenario, it involved the mayan calendar resetting itself to start the cycle again<br><br>yeah i dont see a pattern here

 We&#39;re not out of the woods yet, since they expect another one in 2038....aka &#39;Year Problem&#39;, Unix Millenium Bug...or Y2820. They say that just before or after Jan 31st 2037-38 will start a bug that will destroy software, C programming of every big 32-bit computer system in the world thanks to the Timex Coding Error. Just in time for Tesla&#39;s Electric Cars to become worldwide, it will destroy all markets, computers and datas. I know the 90s was scary with this shit, now, it&#39;s going to be even worse.

 Yeah, back in 96, I was first mentioned and then 98 and 99...they doomsay us constantly about this thing. It didn&#39;t help that we had computer related disaster films during this time. So much hype, so much scare. I ended crying a lot of times....and yes, I was 9-10 years old...but yeah, newspapers, news, everything was full of it....and it didn&#39;t help when the Simpsons did that halloween episode where a Homer infected the world&#39; computers. I believed it would happened and basically stayed up on Dec:31 watching the clock and waiting........and guess what......I was just basically massively tired for school the next day.<br>Tired and being laughed at for being gullible. I didn&#39;t care, I was so relieved it never happened.....

 Y2K could have been a problem if people didn&#39;t deal with it beforehand. However, since people knew years ahead of time they could fix any issues that might arise so that the Y2K bug turned out to be a non-issue.

 The easiest way would have been to put 2000 in 2K after which you guys can change it. Also The computers last digits affecting would have been less severe, if they had programmed the years depending on the date and to calculate the 365.25 days, in this ways the date bug or error would not have been a big issue.

 Oh gosh, I remember growing up with the whole Y2K event, for me in the UK it was more commonly known as the Millennium Bug, I remember it being talked about in magazines, It was honestly made out as some sort of malicious attack, something that was set to explode as the new year comes in. I just thought it was some sort of virus that had been detected or something. Imagine like Covid levels of panic where the world started preparing for our computers to suddenly stop or go haywire something haha.

 The Y2K Panic was about selling software in my opinion because I was in that industry at the time and everybody was selling software to their grandmother. You could Panic older people easily just by telling them their entire computer system will shut down, or they lose their money blah blah blah. Everybody panicked because nobody wants to lose their information, their data or their money. <b>Remember this when people tell you the world will end in 7-years like AOC did</b>

 I&#39;ve been reading a lot of the comments and most of you were too young to even remember this. I was actually selling computer software from a store I worked in in 1999 and 2000 and I sold sht tons of software by Norton (symantec) and bunch of other companies that would fix your Y2K problem. They must have made a billion dollars and software sales that year and that&#39;s what I believe powered this Panic. Money, as it always is. Most people systems we&#39;re going to be just fine and they could have taken care of this in a company-wide update but they had the Panic everyone so they could sell software

 Oh man, the memories. I was gonna graduate high school in 2000 (which I still think is a cool year to graduate). I vividly remember staying up to see the clock on our old Mac tick to midnight. A part of me was anxiously anticipating something to happen. The only thing my mom was concerned about was looters. She made sure everything was locked in our house, just in case people wanted to break in to steal supplies. She&#39;s always been like that. She thought that would happen during the pandemic, too, which honestly holds more credence. <br><br>Being alive and old enough to remember Y2K is still a trip to me.

I can‚Äôt understate how intense the panic was‚Äî my parents were actually talking about buying goats and chickens if the work couldn‚Äôt be completed before the turn of the millenium because we might need our own food sources.

 I was 14, and a computer geek. I was less worried than most people, actually looking forward to it. Lol I ran my old 386 PC into Y2K (which I&#39;d ran a Y2K test utility on which it epic failed a few months prior) and saw it clock over to January 1, 2000 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZDa09U7gc&amp;t=12h00m00s">12:00:00</a> without issue. THAT SAID, I did, and do get annoyed when people said, and still say that &quot;it was a scam by the tech companies to make more money&quot; or whatever. The only reason as to why Y2K was as much of a &quot;flop&quot; as it was, was because of all the work that was done by people across the globe to ensure that the brown stuff didn&#39;t hit the fan. Furthermore, that was back in the days when things were actually done properly, and companies didn&#39;t mind spending money on IT. Now they try to cheap out as much as possible, and as a result in most companies IT is a complete mess. 16 years from now we&#39;ll have the 2038 problem, now thats going to be interesting to see.

 I was a teenager in 1999 and I don&#39;t remember there being panic where I lived. There were plenty reassuring voices on the news that talked about all the work that was being done to assure the switch over to 2000 would go fine, and it did. Of course, I&#39;m not surprised to hear that some people did ridiculously overreact to it, and I am very grateful for the hard work of programmers that ensured Y2K just remained an amusing footnote in history and not something more awful.

 While people were worrying themselves to death about Y2K in 1998 and 1999, almost no one seemed too concerned that people could board commercial planes armed only with box cutters and pepper spray, easily break into cockpits once the planes had taken off, kill the captain and the co-pilot by slitting their throats, and then committing suicide by flying the planes into two of the world‚Äôs tallest buildings, a building that houses the HQ of the United States military, and a field in Pennsylvania all while killing thousands of people at the same time.

 I was 12 when we hit the new millennium, I remember it being a worry but my stepmom and my dad told me they weren&#39;t concerned about it so my 12 year-old self didn&#39;t lose any sleep over it. I do remember watching the first airing of Futurama at like midnight (dad didn&#39;t censor my TV input much). <br>Cool memory, but I don&#39;t recall this much concern over Y2k. Seemed like most folks I talked to during that time period weren&#39;t worried, but this was NW Georgia in the 90&#39;s. Still an alarming percentage of rural Georgians who don&#39;t know how the internet works, so back then I imagine it was much much worse. I bet in the cities it was a hectic and nervous New Year&#39;s Eve, but in rural Georgia it was a pretty neat B-story but not much else.

 I was in my last year of high school when going into the year 2000. I remember not worrying about it too much probably because I was a teenager going to school who didn&#39;t pay much mind to world events. However, I do remember my mom stocking up on food supplies and getting a tank of water that was kept in the garage just in case. We also didn&#39;t go anywhere on New Years because we didn&#39;t know what would happen. We lived in Orlando, Florida at the time and I recall really wanting to go to a Disney or Universal park to ring in the new millennium but my mom was afraid that in case something did happen due to the y2k bug that, for example, we might be stranded at the park if there was a power outage or something and might not be able to leave and drive home somehow. Of course, at the stroke of midnight when the new millennium began nothing happened.

 I had just turned 10 on the 19th of Dec in 1999 and will never forget that day. My dad at the time was working for Best Buy and I remember them handing out stickers to every customer that said &quot;Save your computer! Don&#39;t forget to shut it off and unplug on Dec 31st!&quot; Leading up to that day, a lot of people I knew began to sort of hate computers. It wasn&#39;t that they wanted computers completely gone, but they hated the fact of just how heavily the world had started to rely on computers especially when it came to things like banking, military and prison systems/security, travel, ect. Which to be fair after things like the Kronos hacking and so many people not getting paid by their job for many weeks, possibly longer, I have to agree in a way. Yes computers make everything faster, more connected, more convenient, ect, but when the go down or programs are hacked, it makes it very stressful and scary for people in their lives.

The date format on the player said 01-01-00. When I had a look at the calendar from 1900 it was a Monday. I knew the VHS recorder wasn&#39;t Y2K compliant but the machine still worked perfectly.

 This video is pretty good! I was like 13 when there was the 1999-2000 thing... I remember to have heard the PC&#39;s were going to go nuts when the New Year would start but in the TV they would not explain what exactly was the problem... we didn&#39;t have a computer at home so we didn&#39;t need to update it. My mum didn&#39;t believe it so we didn&#39;t do any prepping, we just had a good time. <br>In my country a band made a song that said something like :&quot;I don&#39;t believe that the heavens will open and a dragon will emerge, let&#39;s be confident that times will be better&quot; (in Spanish) and the song was talking about all the panic the media and the preachers were creating ... the panic was real. I didn&#39;t know though that there were some software errors, so that&#39;s interesting... thanks to all the programmers that helped avoid this chaos!

 It annoys me when people say it was no big deal. The whole fear from a computer science standpoint is no one can predict what exactly will go wrong unless you have the time to go over every system and trace the use of the date. It is only due to the work of countless smart people that we now laugh at y2k.

 When I was growing up, my grandma always told me &quot;when emotions are high, the intelligence is low no matter how smart a person is&quot;, even tho it wasn&#39;t related to Y2K it applies to it and pretty much everything. Many people today (especially the ones born after that or have been babies in the late 90s) have no idea how scary it was for many people back then and probably think how stupid people were. I was just 9 years old in 1999 and even tho it didn&#39;t affected me because I just had no idea about financing, savings, banks etc. I remember how big of a deal was for a lot of grown ups at the time. They didn&#39;t think the world will end or something like that but a lot of them were saying to everyone to get all their money from the banks before January 1st 2000 because their money could disappear and there was this huge surge of people in the banks to withdrawal their savings and was genuinely terrifying for most people to lose all their money because of a computer.

 There is a perfectly simple solution to prevent such thing from happening again in the future, make all computers recognise years using 11 digits instead of just 4, for example 2003 should be 00000002003 in the background, and 1978 should be 00000001978 in the background, 2 digit and 4 digit years should only be used for display purposes only

 So it was basically the year 2000 that shaped the world into what we know today. The 90s were a wild west in terms of... everything. But Y2K, don&#39;t a few things sound too familiar? Anyone can post anything on the internet, and gain traction, and be famous, even if it&#39;s just lies. Media controlling the masses, and wide-spreading false information (about Covid for example). Chasing the latest and greatest technology, applies a lot to the younger generations. Yes, Y2K was real, but it was blown out of proportion. Fixing it was necessary, 100 billion... tough to judge, but it probably helped the US. And it helped the entire world get more technical, and upgrade, which probably sped up the progress of computers and software.

 I was a QA Tester and Systems Analyst for Y2K in the 90s in Canada.<br><br>The reason why it didn&#39;t happen is yes, many many people were fixing it far beforehand. Banks and Airlines were the first, then other businesses and point of sale devices. The only things that showed up at Y2K, in my area, were a few mom-n-pop shops that did not update their cash registers and other hardware and software. Many of the issues were hard-coded in the chips and those had to be replaced. For others, it was software and that just needed to be updated. <br>By the time Y2K rolled around, it was all &#39;fixed&#39; and done.

 I first learned about Y2K during the summer of 1993 from a computer magazine. They didn&#39;t use the actual term Y2K. They talked about how PCs were not programmed to go beyond 1999. What would happen is they would go back to January 1, 1900, which would cause mass confusion and havoc with infrastructure systems. I didn&#39;t think about it again until Time magazine did an article in 1998 and <i>that&#39;s</i> when the panicking started. Sadly, there were people who preyed on the fear and got wealthy. Radio host Art Bell made a lot of money selling Y2K survival boxes that contained six months worth of freeze dried food and other apocalyptic accessories. I was a fan of his until he started shamelessly preying on people&#39;s fears. By the spring of 1999, it was obvious that companies were taking the threat seriously and had people working on it, sometimes 24 hours a day. I was not afraid of Y2K. I didn&#39;t even stay awake on new year&#39;s eve. I don&#39;t drink but even if I did I wouldn&#39;t drink on new year&#39;s eve. Why would anybody want to start a new year with a hangover? I went to bed at ten and when I woke up it was January 1, 2000 and Vladimir Putin was on the front page of the newspaper as Russia&#39;s new leader.

 I find it hilarious that it was considered frivilous at the time to use 4 digits, or 8 bits, of data for a date, while today it&#39;s a 32 bit signed integer based on how many milliseconds since midnight of 1/1/1900 it&#39;s been... which is going to lead to trouble in 2038 when all of the binary values flip over and computers will think it&#39;s 1762. Never mind that because of binary data storage, most computers instead displayed as 19100 and wouldn&#39;t actually flip backwards until 2028. Most of the actual problems were caused by &quot;error correction&quot; that would convert anything over 100 to 100 less.

 Alright, so, I‚Äôm fine with the advertisement, but I‚Äôm honestly more confused than enlightened, sorry. It‚Äôs just the way you talk. It‚Äôs difficult to follow.

 It was kind of a trip being 9 years old and expecting the world to end. My dad was really into computers and a paranoid type of person, he kept saying planes were gonna fall out of the sky and all this stuff. I was so relieved when I woke up on 1/1/2000 and nothing seemed to be happening. But then a couple years later, some planes did fall out of the sky and hit the Twin Towers, and poor old dad died of an actual heart attack a few weeks later. Yeah I was a super well-adjusted teenager why do you ask

 There was a lot of effort that was really necessary.<br>The problem is that layman people don&#39;t have a good idea on what it was necessary *for*.<br><br>A watch would have no issues, and many systems like Pentium were already Y2K ready. The major problems was with machines that people didn&#39;t interact directly with, such as mainframes, satellites, military equipment, and a lot of  old machines running important transactions such as banking.<br>Since people don&#39;t see how these machines operate and didn&#39;t see the enegineers and programmers fixing the issue, they naturally think it was a hoax.<br><br>Also the media is largely to blame the scope of the impact. It was never about falling planes or nukes going off. It was more about banking system collapsing due to either negative or huge debt calculations, plane reservations becoming irredeemable, databases miscalculating people&#39;s age, and satellites miscalculating orbits (the latter did happen).<br><br>It&#39;s just one more of those things that people don&#39;t understand because they equate the media&#39;s &quot;scientists say&quot; for what the scientists are truly saying. These two are often not the same.

 I was fairly young during y2k so my memory&#39;s pretty fuzzy about how the world was back then, but I don&#39;t recall there being to much actual panic about y2k. Like, I remember hearing about it on tv and I seem to recall being somewhat nervous during the ball drop but not quite understanding why, and I remember like 5 minutes after the ball dropped my dad joking about how he guessed the world wasn&#39;t ending after all but that&#39;s about it... Oh, I also remember seeing a y2k bug plushie being sold at walmart either before or after the new year.<br><br>I&#39;m just gonna assume that after the entire state of Florida was basically on fire in 98, we Floridians collectively decided that we weren&#39;t gonna even entertain the idea of a techno apocalypse happening one year later. Sounds like a Florida thing to do at least. I should ask my mom and dad if they remember any wide scale y2k panic...

 There‚Äôs always been fake news, people just didn‚Äôt know better back when Cronkite was giving it, and have some kind of misplaced nostalgia for that era. News wasn‚Äôt more accurate back then, it was just trivial for companies to get away with lying, because they owned the media space. It was still somewhat that way in Y2K, but they were starting to clash with the fact that anyone could come online and tell a ton of people things that contradicted the media narrative when it was false.<br><br>Thing about Y2K, the traditional media is where you‚Äôre getting your clips. News stations, a documentary featuring Leonard Nimoy. They‚Äôre traditional media getting it wrong, something they did frequently. The argument over ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is now heating up because now things are becoming centralized, and a bunch of massive companies with interests contrary to your‚Äôs are once again able to snuff out all other information and create a narrative. They‚Äôre trying to guard this opportunity jealously, which is why both sides have lobbed accusations of being fake news at each other. The tech giants lob it at those who contradict their false narrative to try and continue their grip on the public‚Äôs attention, and independent sources are throwing it at big tech because in many cases they actually do spread lies because they fit their narrative. The biggest recent examples are when they censored anyone who talked about the lab leak theory for the origins of Covid-19. They banned or deleted comments of anyone who talked about it. Now they allow it because the truth got so big they couldn‚Äôt deny it.

 what a kick in the memories, I remember when some people were TERRIFIED and SCARED AF about the 2000s, I was 11 years old back then and some friends and even teachers were telling me about the disaster and HOW all the computer networks were going to fail and in some cases the machine was going to explode, the bank acct thing, the lethal bug in the airport system, the &#39;1900&#39; date... with an extreme seriousness, almost as if it were true xD <br><br>oh; the 2000s panic, what a ridiculous and fascinating thing it was, all I did that year was laugh and surf&#39; the web as usual in my old house, waiting for the new era of chrome pants, flying cars and robots... stuff that never came.

 I was born in 2000. And based on just how much Technology has evolved and how much humanity or it least our world leaders have devolved and just how Corrupt and divided the United States of America is now as of 2022 and how tensions have risen to critical mas and mainstream media and our government continue to fail us and support Corporate Rule, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we see panic, chaos, and destruction, and irreparable harm far worse than Y2K within the next decade or so. Combined with Facists about to strike and potentially end our way of life as well as the Climate Crisis being to late to stop and all we can do now is Minimize the damage within the next 5 years in order to prevent a mass extiction, we haven&#39;t even begun to see what true chaos looks like yet.<br><br>Regardless, nice video and I choose to take away lessons from these types of things regardless of my own personal biases or opinions because I am always willing to learn. Especially for the sake of learning from Humanities past mistakes and even more so for the sake of never making those mistakes ever again.

 As someone who was 15 around the time of 2000, I can honestly state this video was so full of inaccuracies, exaggeration and hyperbole that I had to stop it after a few minutes. There are always people who panic buy at the smallest sign of trouble, that&#39;s nothing new, and where I was in the UK most people knew what it was but weren&#39;t concerned. If the same sort of thing happened today people probably would lose their minds though, because coping skills have really nose dived in the past 2 decades, thanks social media for making everyone weaker minded, hypersensitive crybabies. üòÇ

 Nothing happened in 2000 because we didn&#39;t let it happen.<br><br>Back in 1998, I was an avid reader of PC Magazine and PC Computing, and slowly but surely learned that Y2K was a serious issue that could&#39;ve had terrible consequences hadn&#39;t the IT industry as a whole organized to fix decades of neglecting the problem. There were easy tests that could be performed on home PC&#39;s that told you if you were prepared for Y2K and my computer wasn&#39;t, so I immediately fixed it, and so did millions of people around the world, especially in important entities like banks, airlines, industries, schools, governments, etc. That&#39;s why the most catastrophic effects of the bug never happened.<br><br>If only we were so prepared to fight Covid before it got out of control, the world wouldn&#39;t be like it is right now.

And yes, when I was about 8 or 9 years old before this happened, my friend and I talked about how it was going to make the stock market crash and everybody was going to starve and die and there was going to be apocalyptic sized wars.

 I was born in &#39;95, and my gosh: my mother was sadly a victim to the Y2K scare.<br><br>I remember in our basement, we had a pantry and 2 freezers: a chest freezer and a fridge/freezer.<br><br>That pantry used to be STOCKED w/ all kinds of stuff: soups, dried perishables, snacks, toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, like 20 jugs of water....it was a serious scare to her.<br><br><br>But alas, in recent years we&#39;ve repurposed it for strictly toiletries and paper towels. It is FAR more empty now, and now our actual pantry has far less in it on our ground floor.<br><br>Unlike being stockpiled and hoarded, we now have far less in our pantry, but enough for like 2-3 days should the power go out for whatever reason.<br><br><br><br>But the fear and scare still resided back then: it was a really worrying thing that could&#39;ve had domino-effect levels of catastrophe.<br><br>Thankfully, we picked ourselves up, worked through the debugging, updated all infrastructures, and fixed whatever issues came our way when the year 2000 happened!<br><br>Thanks for an awesome subject and video, and perfect timing for New Years!<br><br>Be safe, everyone :)

 2022-01-01: Microsoft felt nostalgic for the good old days and left a piece of bad code that caused many Exchange (Mail) servers to stop processing e-mail because it couldn&#39;t process the year 2022 due to a very similar problem (storing 2 digits for the year at the beginning of a Long- typed number which couldn&#39;t support a year beyond &#39;21).

 I love that you posted this the day before a similar bug occurred.<br><br>Nowadays dates are often stored in a YYMMDDhhmm format. Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute. It allows you to quickly compare two strings to determine the order of things: The higher number will always come after a lower number. Problem is, APPARENTLY certain systems (cough MICROSOFT cough) store those dates as a string with a maximum length of 32 bits in a certain subsystem, meaning the highest number it could handle is 2,147,483,647. But when it ticked over to the new year, it went from 2,112,252,359 to 2,201,010,001.<br><br>That number is too big to fit in the 32 bits, so the entire Microsoft Exchange system just straight up stopped working.<br><br>People have been calling it Y2K22. Because ffs Microsoft.

 This is often misleading in its oversimplification, and just technically wrong in other places.<br>In many places, he implies that Y2K was a problem with old machines. Y2K was a software bug.<br>It suggests that storing dates with 2-digit years was necessary to save memory/storage. Well, when using inefficient date formats (such as those used by the programming language COBOL), it did save space, but it was not a problem if efficient formats were used. A date could be stored in 4 bytes (typical in some languages, such a C) and represent dates far beyond 10,000 (you could do that in 3 bytes if you used an non-standard format), while a typical COBOL system required 6 bytes to even store a date with a 2-digit year (because it stored each digit in a separate byte).<br>It does make important correct points though, including that it was not fake - it was avoided. (Of course, some Y2K predictions were not realistic, and the video (correctly) does NOT claim that they were.)

 For everyone who was too young to witness it: Don&#39;t be sad. You&#39;ll most likely be able to experience something similar in 2038, when the UNIX timestamp, which is also used to measure time in computers (defined as number of seconds that passed since 1st January 1970) passes the 32-bt integer limit (2,147,483,647) and causes an variable overflow. The computers will crash, the time will go 68 years to the past etc. We&#39;ll have just as much fun as our parents.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem</a>

 How long as Unix time been a thing? If it was before 2000 and even when Y2K was first mentioned in mass media, this problem has likely been solved before it even began. The panic is likely when trying to convert human-readable time back to Unix time. Poorly coded parsing systems can lead to unintended consequences.<br><br>Unix time is a 32-bit signed integer that has +1 added to it every second. The next issue is an overflow error with maxing out a 32-bit signed integer, when converted to human-readable time, is 03:14:08 UTC on 19 January 2038.

 My house was actually purchased as a result of Y2k. The false preachers told the people that lived here before us to sell all of their property (and valuables and such too I think) because the apocalypse was underway. And thus, we got the house roughly around 70 grand cheaper probably. Was great for us but was unfortunately sad for them because they were deceived though. Hope they didn&#39;t get too financially and emotionally damaged because of that. :/

 USA spent a hundred billion dollars to avoid Y2K bugs and when nothing happened people got angry? Well, I think was well spent money then. Some airports and government satellite networks had Y2K glitches. But there are several date bugs: the 2013 Deep Impact Bug that overflowed 2^32 counter of tenths of seconds since begin of 2000, so losing the probe, the 2038 Unix bug (overflowing 32 bits counters of seconds since the begin of 1970, that was already mostly fixed doubling the bits of the counter) and several more. In fact very 1024 weeks (about 19.5 years) GPS satellites rollover their date counters this caused problems twice since their were deployed and the next rollover will be in 2038 too.

 This video made me realise that Y2K was actually an issue. Coming from after it happened, I never experienced it, but I didn&#39;t realise how computers stored dates, and had assumed it was the 32 bit integer counting from January 1st, 1970, not just the last 2 numbers. Basically I thought people didn&#39;t understand binary and that y2k was what most people thought the year 2038 problem might be in the future. <br><br>(for anyone who doesn&#39;t know, time on computers is now usually calculated from a 32 bit number counting up every second from January 1st 1970. This number is a string of 0s and 1s, 32 numbers in total, meaning it can represent 2^32 or around 4.3 billion numbers. This number will &quot;fill up&quot; on the 19th January 2038, causing something like the y2k bug. This is a simplified explanation of what I gather from wikipedia, and my own knowledge of how computers work, if you want more info, i suggest looking it up yourself)

NYE 1999 was so strange because my mother was convinced the world was going to end so she just went to sleep with my brother (a toddler) and decided to &quot;go out that way&quot; and meanwhile LEFT ME IN MY ROOM, THANKS, MOTHER

 I remember Y2K as a child. My dad spent most of his time laughing about it. Having worked on computers during his time with the army he wasn&#39;t worried. When New Year&#39;s came around my whole family was up late for the countdown and he jokingly said to all of us: &quot;Ready for the world to end?&quot;<br><br>I told him I was ready to sleep. It was difficult staying up that late.

 I was in high school in the 90&#39;s. I remember all the hype about this. One day I was at school late. I think it was a class trip and we got back too late for the late late bus. I was trying to call my mom on the pay phone.. yes.. pay phone. There was this guy there at the school who was leaving. I think I asked if he had a quarter. I called and my mom didn&#39;t answer. He asked me what was up, and I explained that I was trying to get a hold of someone to get a ride home. He offered a ride home. Any way.. he was at the school holding a night class for Y2K preparedness. So there were a bunch of business owners that were there to learn what they needed to do to make sure they didn&#39;t have an issue. But I chatted with him the whole way home about it. He was a bit impressed at me because the things I was saying that I thought a person who owned a business should do, was correct. I learned a lot about what was going on with the Y2K thing, beyond what the media was hyping. He told me that as long as things were happening like they were, there most likely would not be much to Y2K. He said the biggest effect it would have on companies was the expenditure to upgrade systems and software. He said most people will see no effects from Y2K. He said if what was in the works at that time wasn&#39;t, there would be a lot of problems.

 Its weird just coming out of a new years day, into a brand new year, and thinking about this. Just 15 hours ago, people were counting down in excitement, drinking, partying, having a good time. Every new years since i was a kid was about the celebration. 22 years ago, I wasn&#39;t even existent. The turn of a millenium is something people should have been absolutely awestruck over. 1000 years is a long ass time. I haven&#39;t even been alive for 1/50 of that. Everything I know is less than a fraction of that time, but everyone had to deal with this panic. If we had our tech today 22 years ago, people would&#39;ve laughed at the concept, but we have been dancing on the cutting edge for years, something as simple as a 19 becoming a 20 is nothing now. Back then? Lord, it must have been the worst. Party, and panic, like it is 1999.

 I remember the &quot;panic&quot; many felt was coming on the passing of 1999 to 2000. I found the fear-mongering quite amusing. The computer code needed to correct this up-coming possible calamity was actually quite simple. However, as the problem was mostly &quot;hardwired&quot; into systems, that simple fix was  tedious to implement. Difficult, even. But not impossible. The entire computer community came together to furiously patch the problem. &quot;Armageddon&quot; was avoided. As I knew it would be. Nonetheless, I played this song as the clock counted down to Jan. 1, 2000:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY</a>

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZDa09U7gc&amp;t=5m52s">5:52</a> Most computers back then used BCD for dates, so 4 bits represent a number of 0-9, and one byte could thus represent 0-99. Thus a full date without century would be three bytes. In theory, cutting off the decade from the year, and realizing that a BCD digit actually can represent 0-15, you could fit the whole date in only two bytes (nibbles: DD MY). Although you lose some of the convenience that BCD has. Weird what people back then thought would be a good idea.

 These are things that make me very glad to be born in 2005.  The Y2K scare was over with and even then, my parents weren&#39;t really afraid of it.  Thankfully, my dad never really cared about computers in those times (still can barely figure out how to turn one on) and my mom is very on top of things and can tell when a global freakout is bs or not.  Due to this combination, I wound up learning how to use a computer for baby games and such when I was very little.  I&#39;m currently learning more about them, though I&#39;m not completely tech savvy.  That said, this was a great video.  I love learning about these kinds of things that happened in our history and I always come to this channel for my source;  Happy new years to everyone reading this comment.

 surprised you never talked about 2k38 or UNIX epoch overflow... lemme explain, I promise it&#39;s short.<br>UNIX is basically the operating system... for operating systems. There is also, of course, the newer Linux and, if you&#39;re going to pull a Microsoft, secret DOS, but modern Windows and MacOS are UNIX-based. As with all genuinely functioning programs(or happy children), they have to have some connection to and knowledge of their parent, which for an operating system would be the real world. These connections for UNIX would have to include:<br>-the time<br>-the date<br>-if the processor is melting<br>The way it checks if the processor is melting is quite self-explanatory, but the way it handles the date and time isn&#39;t, and may actually be relevant right now. The date and time are actually stored together as one variable, the UNIX epoch, magically ticking up every second even while the processor is off. But this is a number... on a computer. And occasionally numbers on computers do this funny thing: they forget how to count and go all the way back to 0. (aka overflow) Do you remember how this issue is called the UNIX epoch overflow? I don&#39;t feel like I need to explain further, but on January 17, 2038, at ~3:15 AM UTC, it&#39;s actually not. It&#39;s new years day again, welcome to 1970.<br><br>Maybe it could be a little bit shorter, just perhaps?

 My manager remembered that on his previous job, they were offered 5 times their daily salary just to render overtime the whole night of December 31, 1999 until the morning of January 1, 2000.

 The reason Y2K never &quot;happened&quot; is because countless people worked very hard behind the scenes reprogramming various systems, etc. This was a serious problem that would have resulted in many important computer systems shutting down.

I said they had nothing to left to do to help the average person by midnight of December 31st, 1999 yet the media engaged in fear mongering and unethical IT people made a killing selling unnecessary bug fixes to scared people with modern home computers.

 Speaking ad someone who was there for the whole Y2K thing, I must say that this is very well covered here! Most sane people had faith in the world&#39;s programmers that they would update everything in time, but still had enough cash/food/supplies on hand to last until everyone could be brought back online if there&#39;d been a glitch, bug, or they just ran out of time before everything was nice and patched. <br><br>Also, the internet during this time was Gen X&#39;s playground, and we&#39;re a bunch of trolls!   This , no doubt, contributed to the propagation of the fake news. People making shit up, making it look legit as possible, and fooling even seasoned journalists. This was then put out to the general public, panic ensues, and the trolls laugh, not believing people actually bought it.  Very little fact-checking was done back then, and everything was anonymous. There were no consequences for what you did on the information superhighway.  It was the wild west, and the boomers weren&#39;t prepared for it. üòï
