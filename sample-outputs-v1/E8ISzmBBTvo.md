 Assumptions and bias are not feelings by feelings I&#39;m referring to emotions. What they are is preconceived notions usually due to experiences. Ben has such when touching on religious views.  But in this saying it would be true facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.  For example if presented with biological proof that you are a certain gender and no matter what you do you will remain that gender.  You come back with I feel like a woman doesn&#39;t negate the fact that you are not a woman and a simple DNA test proves it. Now the fact that you feel like a woman may be true but nothing will change that you are not a female.  I guess if you redefine what a woman is then it may be possible to have a man become a woman but that is linguistics as words evolve their meaning but I would think that you would need to get a majority of people to accept the changes to the definition.

 Empiricism is a matter of perception, too; it&#39;s based on observation, but those observations are fallible in the sense that we are not able to perceive everything in the universe, so your results might be a coincidence or might be missing something vital that caused them.  Take me, for instance: I was born without a sense of smell.  That means that I can empirically state that smell doesn&#39;t exist; in all of my many years, I have never smelled anything, so it&#39;s just a myth.  That&#39;s pretty obviously false, but a good example of the possibilities of how even the hypothetical pure objectivity might not be reality.

 As a statistics major, a lot of this video‚Äôs concepts are familiar. It can be quite easy to gain biased data. People, perhaps unintentionally, can easily overrepresent or overrepresent something in data. And even assuming the data is gathered correctly, the conclusions you claim from the data can easily be something the data doesn‚Äôt say. When humans get their fingers on truth, we dirty it. Statistics is a useful tool, but we need to use it responsibly.

 There&#39;s so many alt-rights, conservative quoters, and &quot;centrists&quot; here, I&#39;m not sure what normal people think of the video anymore. Its pretty obvious no one saw the whole video, and thought to themselves how human objectivness to data is just unchecked subjectivness in practice. You &quot;2 times 3 is not 6 with my feelings&quot; idiots.<br><br>I still disagree with the video tho lol. Not really that the philosophy is wrong, just that Sharpie&#39;s quote can be used in a few explicitly factual, unbiased situations that can barely be changed by humans. COVID was a downplayed &quot;feeling&quot; for half of the US. A flat disc Earth conspiracy is also a &quot;feeling&quot;. <br><br>Also, the only way we can stop these trash trained models is if we work on developing and tweaking them, not a counter-Enlightenment culture to bring us back.

 It is an objective fact that it is easy to collect and interpret data far too narrowly to be useful to anyone. It&#39;s not good enough to simply have something that says X, to qualify as good science you also need to establish competantly that it can&#39;t be anything other than X. And when it comes to people, especially psychology/sociology, this is impractically difficult. Only some studies manage to fund such efforts, to collect massive amounts of high quality data and offer a comprehensive enough model to not have any obvious counter-arguments, and mostly in medicine.

 I truly cannot believe what I am hearing. You are actually completely unironically saying that someone just presenting the facts as they are are actually presenting emotions. I do believe you have completely lost wouldn&#39;t definitions of facts and emotions are. There&#39;s absolutely no possible way that you can present facts and have it not be anything but that. You can present them in a misleading way sure, but the facts don&#39;t change based on your emotions. If you wanted to make a video talking about cognitive biases and confirmation bias excetera then you could have done that but this is simply not what you are referring to.

 I haven&#39;t watched this entire video yet, I plan to, but I just wanted to add a point. I think the phrases, &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; and &quot;facts do care about your feelings&quot; in themselves are not completely &quot;sound&quot;, for lack of a better term. The phrases in themselves assume that facts are even capable of caring, or for that matter, knowing about anything. As I understand it, facts are just concepts we use to understand the natural world. They are abstract ideas to explain concrete things. Facts are not beings like you or me, thus cannot have feelings or emotion. Facts are the things we create in order to understand, they are not inherent properties of reality that just exist. Facts are human-made. Turns out I just finished the video while writing this. I think this brings up a misconception in these phrases. As Zoe said in the video, perception of facts is actually what is important to look at. All of our minds are different, and how I view the world is not the same as how anyone else views the world. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but it will change what I consider to be factual. Because of this difference in perception, there can never be &quot;true&quot; facts, at least not in the way we might think. There could be &quot;true&quot; facts in the sense that there are &quot;real&quot; aspects of reality. Thought, what I am meaning is, there can never be &quot;true&quot; facts in the sense that we will all perceive them the same way. I think &quot;true&quot; facts in terms of reality are unknowable because of this. For example, one idea that was strongly believed to have been a fact in ancient times was Aristotle&#39;s Four Elements Theory, that everything was made up of fire, air, water, earth, and quintessence, nowadays we view that idea as ludicrous, mythological, it is no longer a fact of reality according to society. In this case, I do agree with Zoe, facts do &quot;care&quot; about your feelings in this sense. If facts are concepts that we create ourselves, then whether we want it to or not, our perception and view of reality will have an effect on what we consider to be factual or not. I think further evidence of this could be found in quantum theory, specifically regarding the Bohr-Einstein Debate. Einstein believed that the universe was deterministic, meaning that reality exists independent of our perceptions of it. On the other hand, Bohr believed that how we perceive things does have an effect on reality. I do not remember the exact name for this idea though. One might be interested in viewing the episode of PBS Space Time which talks about this debate. I believe it was titled &quot;Quantum Entanglement and the Bohr-Einstein Debate&quot;. I think Zoe&#39;s argument is true if we consider &quot;facts&quot; to be human-created ideas. Though, I think, if we consider &quot;facts&quot; in this context to be real aspects of reality, then both claims become unfalsifiable. As demonstrated by the Debate, and further by various ideas surrounding epistemology and metaphysics, we cannot know what is truly real or not. Our universe could be reliant upon our ideas, and thus, our feelings, or it may be completely independent of how we feel, thus seeming to not &quot;care&quot; about our feelings. We do not have the knowledge to back up either of these claims, if this is how we define facts in this context.

 I used to be one of those &quot;facts and logic&quot; people, but then I learned about Antonio Damasio and his patient &quot;Elliot,&quot; who had suffered brain damage from a tumor. His intelligence and memory were unaffected, but he no longer felt any emotion. He reacted to both positive and negative emotional stimuli with total neutrality. One might think being unencumbered by emotion would mean &quot;Elliot&quot; would be an extremely rational and logical decision-maker. This was not so. After losing his ability to feel emotion, he became incapable of making sound decisions, if he made decisions at all. Even something as basic as deciding what to eat for lunch could take hours. He wasn&#39;t able to organize documents at his job because he just couldn&#39;t decide how best to do it. Without emotion, he wasn&#39;t able to place any value on particular scenarios or choices, and so ended up losing his job, destroying his marriage and generally ruining his life. The fact that didn&#39;t care about MY feelings was that *logic cannot function without emotion*. The two are not separate forms of information processing at war with each other, they work in tandem. If you ignore one, your entire system of reasoning suffers.

 Facts Vs Feelings is the reminder to simple fundamental:<br>out there lies the world, totally indifferent to human perception, interpretation and cultural consensus on what reality should look like.<br>A rock will remain rock, cold and solid, completely despite one&#39;s feelings about it.<br><br>Yes, the way we handle the information is inevitably goes through cultural, subjective sphere.<br>There is no way to handle the facts without some way of interpretation.<br>There is no even pure perception: for example, the processing of light inside the human eye contains complex pattern-matching mechanisms, which deliver the pre-made images instead of raw signals to the brain.<br>Yet rock remains rock. If one changes rock to fluffy cloud in his mind, it still will hurt him.<br><br>That is the key point.<br>Human understood the impossibility of raw reality without subjective piece attached.<br>Then he understood he can change reality just through the subjective layer.<br>And then he decided he can change <i>entire</i> reality just with the subjective.<br>Nope. He can not.<br><br>When mental-made part of conscience stops listening to non-caring facts of outer world, when it tries to overwhelm that facts and force them to care, dramatic events begin to unfold.<br>Such conscience starts running the risk to get under the rock.<br><br>And now the subjective of human is worshiped.

 A). I&#39;ll listen, but it sounds like you&#39;ve jumped off the cliff diametrically opposed to Shapiro&#39;s.  He is of course completely correct on the surface.  Facts are empirical observations, not living beings.  As such, they have no emotions.  That does not imply emotions are without meaning, importance, or validity.  Conversely, that Einstein viscerally disliked the statistical basis of quantum mechanics (&quot;G-d does not play dice with the universe.&quot;) takes nothing away from the work of e.g., Planck and Bohr.  From a psychological perspective, his attitude could even be considered a fact.  It is not, however, relevant to a discussion of particle physics.<br><br>B)  Numbers cannot lie, but lies can be told with numbers. I think it was Mark Twain who said there were lies, damn lies, and statistics.

I can say something similar about nearly every scientist and engineer I know.

 No facts do not care about your feelings. thats what makes them a fact. what you are talking about is interpretation.

 There‚Äôs a reason that saying caught on. Because damn near every single viral clip of Shapiro ever made is him attempting to use reason and data to make his points while leftist college kids and other media talking heads scream incoherently at him or just stand there mute. Ignoring any one specific issue I certainly put more credence in his ‚Äúfacts‚Äù than their ‚Äúfeelings.‚Äù<br>And even when you start to value both feelings and facts rather than just feelings at all cost he certainly seems to take a hell of a lot more Ws than Ls.<br>Your point about IQs was telling. You aren‚Äôt actually saying feelings matter but simply that you disagree with Shapiros facts. Or more accurately that his facts aren‚Äôt facts at all. (I‚Äôve never heard him say black people have a lower IQ. Only that they test lower on IQ tests. And I‚Äôve heard him say IQ tests aren‚Äôt a good way of measuring intellect. I think you might mean he says black people commit more crimes. But whatever, for arguments sake let‚Äôs say he said that.) Which is just another way of saying he‚Äôs wrong. Which again is counter to your whole point. Btw it‚Äôs not so much that there is a problem with people referencing their feelings. It‚Äôs that only certain feelings are given any credence. The feelings that come from whoever is on the bottom (or top?) of the oppression hierarchy. I assure there is no great emphasis on the feelings of white straight men by these people. So great. Your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù matter and the feelings you value are important. A slight regression from your stated thesis but there you go‚Ä¶ I certainly feel that trans drag shows are child abuse but that‚Äôs bigotry because other (more important) people feel differently. Because now we are back to the problem. Feelings are just that. When only ones groups feelings are taken into account then facts are all you can fall back on.

 I think you misconstrue Shapiros sentiment. A telling anecdote. Someone asked him if he would use a persons preferred pronouns in a social setting. He said he would. Because, essentially, there is no reason not to and to refuse would be rude. However as a public persona, with a political agenda, he will not say that men are woman or woman are men. Because the truth matters.<br>All you are saying is that stats can be skewed and that a persons lived experience matters. No one is denying that. You say bias and fallibility exists. No one is denying that. Simply that is important to attempt to overcome personal bias and fallibility. Your relativist sentiment and appeal to authority ideal that, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know the facts,‚Äù is bullshit. Take that to its logical extreme and you start sounding like the people that question the most basic truths. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt KNOW that Pearl Harbor occurred on December 7th 1941. You weren‚Äôt there‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt KNOW that the Earth is flat‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>I think you would agree that getting to the absolute bottom of the truth can be extremely important. We shouldn‚Äôt just accept what Greta Thunberg is having a nervous breakdown about. We shouldnt just trust a big oil companies literature on pollution. In order to actually combat global warming or pollution in general is is very important to actual verifiably measure these things. At the end of the day taking Thunbergs nervous feelings as reason big oils bias as truth actually makes addressing the issue more difficult.<br>In addressing the IQ issue you‚Äôve actually contradicted yourself. You haven‚Äôt shown that facts care about feelings. Simply that you disagree with Shapiros ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù Or more accurately, he doesn‚Äôt have facts on his side. (I mean I‚Äôve never heard him say black people have a lower IQ. Only that black people test lower on IQ tests. Two very different things but I‚Äôll take your word for it for arguments sake) Basically you‚Äôre simply saying that Shapiro is wrong. Not that the difference between right and wrong is unimportant.<br>The fact is you are copping out on the issue at large. Because the fact of the matter is that certain people, and it certainly seems like leftists are leading the way here, are indeed advancing feelings at all costs. They aren‚Äôt saying let‚Äôs REALLY analyze the facts to make sure our biases are influencing. Let‚Äôs REALLY make sure we got our facts right. They are saying fundamental truths don‚Äôt matter. Take the issue of trans athletes in sports. The entire basis of the arguments is rooted in feeling. What will make a person or people happy. Not the objective realities of male and female bone density or reaction times or how these things change or don‚Äôt change after the introduction of hormones or any data at all. And even in the rare occasion facts are introduced these people are all too willing to abandon them for feeling. Which is an important note. When you champion facts over feelings in an honest way, you are tacitly admitting that your mind is all too willing to change the introduction of new and better data. Too many people today who are feelings over facts feel the exact opposite. ‚ÄúTrans people should be able to compete in sorts because after a year of estrogen hormones a man is exactly the same athletically and physically as a woman‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not true. Here‚Äôs all this data that shows otherwise.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be that as it may trans people should still be able to compete as either gender  they identify with.‚Äù<br>You see the data, the facts didn‚Äôt matter at all. And in so many of these cases they don‚Äôt.<br>Also I feel you are also ignoring the reality that we have found ourselves in. Where this emphasis on feelings has be was yes downright insanity. Where there are 173 and counting genders. Where you can sexually identify as a planet. Where ‚Äúdemon self‚Äù is a legitimate pronoun. Where 20% of teenagers identify as non binary. Not to get to focused on the ‚Äútrans issue.‚Äù <br>Where you started but seemed to forget is how feelings can be manipulated and back to why objective reality is important in actually addressing the issue. <br>Finally you talk about the importance of feelings but you don‚Äôt really mean that. The feelings argument only ever goes one way. Towards whichever side wins the oppression Olympics at that moment. As a white nan I could say I fear the cops more than black men. They don‚Äôt understand my lived experience as a white man dealing with police. You‚Äôll call bs. Despite the fact that white men are MORE likely to be wrongfully shot by police. As a white man I could say I feel my scholastic chances are thwarted by systemic oppression towards woman. You wouldn‚Äôt support me. Despite the fact that next June woman graduating with Masters degrees will outnumber men almost 2-1. So you say feelings matter but they don‚Äôt. Only the proper feelings matter. As dictated by the hierarchy of oppression as you see it.

 What I&#39;m getting out of this is feelings influence the presentation of facts, nothing about the facts themselves. Obviously biases can skew data to favor certain agendas and all but at the end of the day that&#39;s just the presentation, being disingenuous doesn&#39;t invalidate the data in its entirety, which is what Ben Shapiro meant with his tweet. Of course people will present parts of data to benefit their claims and ideologies while ignoring what doesn&#39;t suit their narrative, but that has nothing to do with facts wavering due to human emotion. This seemed like a misinterpretation of Shapiro&#39;s tweet to proceed with how facts are presented with bias which is not what Shapiro was referring to.

 Think about these petty crimes that are occurring in low-income communities, like Zoe said, often these communities have majority African American or Latino population, these crimes are disturbing the normal functions of day to day life, the police come to these communities and often solve the problems, simply because there are more petty crimes in low-income communities does not mean that law enforcement is in the wrong, the fact that the data shows that these communities often have more crime goes to show that they need more attention by the police, and If more petty criminals are locked up, it will create safer communities, again, often times for minorities who are themselves disproportionately victims of crime.

 I personally disagree with how this argument is presented because it doesn&#39;t differentiate facts from beliefs. Facts cannot be properly argued against. For example &quot;I am alive at the time I&#39;m writing this&quot; or &quot;there is more than one cup of water in the world&quot; are facts that a reasonable person cannot argue. These things are true regardless of perception or bias. Someone could disagree with those facts, but they don&#39;t make them any less true. In this sense facts truly do not care about a person&#39;s feelings even if our perceptions and biases cause us negative emotions or we simply do not believe they are true.<br><br>This video essay&#39;s discussion of crime statistics in different locations deviates from the main premise. You&#39;re not suggesting that facts care about your feelings, but beliefs. We can study statistics (facts) and come to &quot;reasonable&quot; conclusions about the best course of action (beliefs). What everyone needs to be careful of is potential biases of where these statistics comes from and make sure that we&#39;re properly articulating our sources when we make a &quot;factual&quot; claim. Instead of blindly stating a statistic as fact, it&#39;s more proper to cite a source and what the source demonstrates. Any conclusions that we come to as a result of those facts are our beliefs and are subject to biases.

 The thing with objectivity is, if we pick and choose our facts, we&#39;re no longer objective. We subject the facts to our feelings and leave out vital data simply because it doesn&#39;t align with our preconceptions. It all boils down to a half truth being a whole lie. Context is key. People often make the mistake of drawing their conclusions on facts that align with what they want to believe, then assume their conclusions are what&#39;s factual, rather than the facts they use to establish them. Conclusions are a man made concept. They rarely, if ever take all data into consideration.<br><br>Every single example you provided backs this up. Ben Shapiro essentially built his career around this misconception. But even he consistently fails to realize that his feeling are not a basis for factuality. With my limited understanding, I do believe facts will never care about our feelings. Objective facts don&#39;t change, but our understanding of them does. I am also aware that without a complete understanding, which no one has, what we see as factual today, may just end up disproven tomorrow. That is why science is the most trustworthy source of information we have. It does not deal in absolutes. Even scientists who claim to have absolute certainty of anything, are not scientific in that assumption. That is exactly why emotional attachment to our beliefs is so utterly blinding. It often prevents us from altering our views in the face of new information.<br>Many people argue from authority (gods, politicians, scientists), popularity (most people believe x) or morality (it is evil, so we shouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s relevant), but those are all factors that warp our perception. None of these factors alter the objective validity of our beliefs. The assumption that it does, in any way, is the ultimate logical fallacy.

 I think that sentence is a Trojan horse.

Avoid defining it too closely, or showing real-world examples of how the people you agree with differ when citing data in support of their arguments. (They don&#39;t, and you should mask the fact).<br>&gt;Conclude as though you&#39;ve proved that your targets are not motivated by truth, and proceed to theorise a grand conspiratorial explanation for the game they&#39;re really playing.<br>&gt;Choose a punchy headline you&#39;d like to draw maximum attention to. Assert it several times throughout as though it were the natural corollary of your &quot;argument&quot;.<br><br>You could play at precisely the same romp if your politics were inverted. The only difference would be the nature of the offending data, which is entirely governed by your original prejudices and tendencies. You&#39;re not speaking from a remove here. We&#39;re all in the same boat. In such a position, the only thing it behoves us to do is to address the only pertinent question in regard to the specific truth claims we encounter: what is the quality of the evidence? Resist the impulse to devise a general theory to explain why and how the promulgators of uncomfortable notions are compromised and/or dastardly - that&#39;s a separate claim in itself and requires evidence to justify it in just the same way. If we hear a claim we don&#39;t like, the first thing we ought to do is recognise the arrival of that bias - our own contempt. It gives us a gold-plated excuse not to think. Reality doesn&#39;t owe us the kindness of cohering to our pleasant and comforting notions about the universe. It is highly likely in life that we will encounter a proposition with significant implications that we hate, and that proposition will be true. What mindset would result in your believing it with the least friction? That is probably a more objective mindset than you currently possess.<br><br>The claim that &quot;facts do care about your feelings&quot; still makes as much sense to me as &quot;your shoe size does care about your tiredness&quot;.

 So, here&#39;s your problem, which is the problem that all postmodern ideologiekritik of science runs into - there is no alternative.  Even if we recognize and grant that the specific points of information that a person seeks out will necessarily be biased by that person&#39;s preconceptions, there&#39;s no alternative to seeking out that information.  Somebody has to get it from somewhere.  You&#39;ve successfully taken one step back from the simplistic Structuralist view of the standard model of &quot;reality,&quot; but there are more steps to go.  In order to find an alternative, we have to keep moving backwards.<br><br>Anecdotal evidence - persuasive though it might be - is, if anything, worse than the examples that you bring up here because they are colored not once, but twice.  First, the seeker of information colors the collected data on the basis of what they seek out, and second the provider of information colors the data based on their tremendously imperfect tools of perception.  To put it simply, your brain is dumb and you are terrible at observing and remembering things.  The human brain is capable of accomplishing so many wonderful things, but it&#39;s also woefully inadequate.  For instance, you can&#39;t even remember anything exactly as it was.  Your mind forces your perceptions into a narrative, and that narrative can change.  Memories are like drawings on a chalkboard that your brain erases when it looks at them and then draws back again when it puts them up.  Anecdotes cannot be the answer.<br><br>The only answer - so far as I can tell, anyway - is to correct the method of data collection.  Let&#39;s take the example of crime statistics.  We&#39;ll set aside the question of modeling for now (I&#39;ve worked with and in the discipline and I can tell you stories about why any model is, at best, a curiosity and in no way any sort of firm predictor), and just assume that the crime model &quot;works.&quot;  If you put in accurate statistics on actual crimes - people committing actual criminal infractions - the program will output accurate results.  The problem has to do with the data collection.  You&#39;ve chosen a particularly good example here because the observational bias is obvious.  You will record more crime in places where there are more police looking for crime, just as you will record the existence of more alligators in the Everglades than in the Louisiana swamps if you have more people looking for alligators in the Everglades.  However, it also makes the answer obvious - objectivity.<br><br>We need machines to do our looking for us, and we need them to do that looking universally.  We cannot capture accurate crime statistics because they are molded by the process that we use to gather them in the first place, but if an equal number of robots are dispatched across an entire city, observing an equal span of geography, somehow recording every incident, you will get the result that you need to yield the correct output.  We use an objective source not just to analyze the data, but also to provide it in the first place.  The objectivity of the system must be ensured end-to-end.<br><br>Right now, this is probably impossible.  The technical problems are not that difficult to solve, but the public will to do so is severely lacking.  I don&#39;t think I can conceive of a universe wherein the entire body of citizens of a city or nation will be okay with the kind of low-level surveillance necessary to provide this objective data.  This issue boils down to how much importance we assign to privacy (I am a crazy person, so I assign none - if people want to see what my sad, inadequate penis looks like or poke into the details of what pornography I have viewed, so be it), and it&#39;s not likely that we will ever reach a social consensus.<br><br>So, we&#39;re screwed, right?  Well...not quite.  There is a solution available right now that achieves the end that you&#39;re looking for with as much success as is practical to expect.  Meta-analyses.  To the extent that people like Shapiro and Peterson appeal to actual research (not nearly so much as they pretend they do), they tend to skip straight down to specific papers examining very particular issues.  That sort of fact selection is doomed to reflect their personal biases.  Instead, we should look to meta-analyses.  These are projects that survey the entire content of study of a particular discipline and synthesize a consensus position.  In most cases where you might have an objection, this solves the problem.  The consensus position is that climate change is real and is being forced through anthropogenic causes.  The consensus is that there is, in fact, a difference of approximately one standard deviation between the measured IQ of different &quot;races&quot; (a nebulous and ill-defined term that complicates the issue), but that the drivers behind this are mostly or entirely environmental.  The consensus position is that acupuncture doesn&#39;t do anything that any other placebo of equivalent intrusiveness does.<br><br>This is the only way for us to obtain actionable information that even begins to address the criticisms you raise here.  We can&#39;t simply mash together different individual scientists of different backgrounds in one experimental team and expect that to correct the results.  In classic postmodern fashion, while it is undoubtedly true that each individual brings their own narrative to the process and will select different data, that observation is useless.  At the end, all we can conclude is that there is no way to determine a reasonable action outside of ideological preference - an intolerable notion in a nation and a world in which people are as ideologically divided as the one we inhabit.<br><br>In the end, all of these words and all of this time boil down to one basic fact - the only actionable conclusion we can reach directs us to utilize a tool that already exists in cases where non-specialists must enact policies informed by specialist knowledge.  The meta-analysis.  Unless and until we are prepared to allow machines (the programming of which can be directly observed, modified, and incorporate any objections in order to arrive at true objectivity) to do all of our observing for us, it&#39;s the only option, and the rest of this is wasted keystrokes and used air.

 See we don&#39;t agree on the definition of objective.<br><br>I don&#39;t believe in systematized thinking because every time you drae a box around a system you necessarily have to cut out the details you don&#39;t want to use.<br><br>Objectivity is anytime you don&#39;t act kna conscious bias. Unconscious bias isn&#39;t important because those biases are the results of experiences and human experience is irreducible. Like when you claim to want to fix a social problem for x group you want to cut off the systems at the spots that highlight the people you want to help. Like fixing the results of slavery isn&#39;t possible at all and it&#39;s arbitrary. No one&#39;s trying to equalize the Europeans who&#39;s lives were made much worse by invasions from the east. <br><br>No one is trying to fix the issues the Barbary trade forced onto those groups. <br><br>All of those experiences factor into who showed up and bought slaves from the African slave kings.<br><br>Your feelings choose an arbitrary spot to care about outcomes.<br><br>I care about Intentions.<br><br>Facts are not dependent on ideology this  is a made up post modern shit heel maneuver you use. Facts exist you don&#39;t like the facts and wanna reinterpret them through a different lens of value that lowers the importance of the fact being true.<br><br>You don&#39;t make things less true youn just change the subjective values used to evaluate a litany of facts.<br><br>Men are stronger than women. That is a fact. Your post modern shit just does word games to dance around it.<br><br>You say things like &quot;well if we define strong as x or y&quot; or if you say &quot;man and woman are arbitrary boxes we put around distributions of traits so neither is real since there are exceptions in the average distribution&quot;<br><br>Facts are real and objectively exist and in fact don&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s feelings.<br><br>You&#39;re talking about how facts are used and what motivations there could be for that, not a very good debunking of what the phrase means.

 I disagree with part of what you said in this video Zoe Bee. While it is good to acknowledge your biases and preferences and try to work past them, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you should seek out the opinions of people that believe they are fallible more than those that believe they are not. If anything the admittance of fallibility just confirms that their viewpoint is flawed until or unless refined. Someone who doesn&#39;t acknowledge that they could be biased might not actually be biased, but someone that does is almost guaranteed to be unless they refine their viewpoint. If you want impartiality you have to find someone that is exactly that, impartial. People with biases, whether they admit to having them or not, can be impartial but they have to work harder to be impartial then someone that is that way already. The truth I choose to believe is that you should seek out the opinions and &quot;facts&quot; of those you choose to, individually, without letting an outside source decide for you whether to believe or not, especially based on their willingness to say they could have a flawed or biased thought process. I could be wrong but that is my opinion on your opinion.<br>Either way I enjoyed watching your video and I look forward to watching more, thank you for taking the time to talk about calculus(twice).

 Literally all conservatives care about are their feelings. They base their <i>entire</i> political viewpoint on how they feel about something. If it&#39;s different from how they were brought up or what CIA propaganda told them all their lives, it&#39;s wrong, and it&#39;s wrong because it makes them feel bad, not for any other reason. Take communism for example: ask 100 conservatives to define communism and you will get 100 wrong answers. At best, they will simply describe capitalism. And no amount of proof or education or evidence will change their minds, because the truth conflicts with how they feel. You could say their feelings don&#39;t care about facts.

 Being a reformed fascist myself, I can guarantee that back in my Shapiro days I wouldn&#39;t have bothered to watch any of this, which is actually telling of what often constitutes political and social discourse.<br> <br>What you are saying here, even if not too complicated as long as one has a basic understanding of communication theory, is regardless theory, and not a communicative law; because of the subjective nature of communication as a whole, it is impossible to describe what they are doing in objective terms, which is why they do not recognize criticism beyond that which they can ridicule for their own following. <br><br>To get back to my original point, discourse like this is often constituted of convincing the onlooker. What you are doing is more useful than really trying to address Shapiro&#39;s base. You are convincing the onlooker, the onlooker that I once was, and for this rescue I thank you and others like you.

 It should be said that some sciences are more subject to bias than others.

 I think the facts care or don&#39;t care about feelings is a red herring.  The point is Shapiro is making an argument.  Basic argument structure is fact+assumption= conclusion.  Algebraically, F+A=C.  Selection of a fact or assumption for an argument is dependent on feelings.  So, Shapiro&#39;s argument can&#39;t be divorced from his feelings.  Strict objectivity is impossible, there are only grades of subjectivity.

 I&#39;m sorry but...no.  Facts don&#39;t care about feelings...and neither does logic.  Not only because feelings are nothing but a corrupted affectation of a questionable survival characteristic...but also because facts and logic are incapable of caring about anything because they&#39;re just concepts, not entities.  Feelings are, after all, the direct and exclusive cause of every single &quot;evil&quot; that any creature has ever visited upon another in the entirety of history.  Objective, accurate logic and data, has never perpetrated any such event.<br><br>The problem with Shapiro isn&#39;t that he&#39;s &quot;correct&quot; about facts versus feelings...it&#39;s that he&#39;s a lying sack of shit who never once actually uses either facts or logic, but just hyperbole, cherry-picking, and an absolute laundry-list of logical fallacies.  It&#39;s nevertheless wholly and unalterably true that facts and logic are entirely objective, and absolute.  What varies, is individuals&#39; utilization of them, or lack thereof.  That&#39;s all.

 The irony is that since the 1920s, scientific research‚Äîboth medical and social‚Äî has suggested that human gender and sex diversity are far more complex than the socially constructed ‚Äúmale-female‚Äù binary Shapiro touts as ‚Äúfact.‚Äù <br><br>It‚Äôs worth noting that the primary reason why early peer-reviewed studies affirming what trans people have been saying all along aren‚Äôt common knowledge is due to antisemitism, something that affects Shapiro directly. The Nazi book burnings happened because a Jewish doctor, Magnus Hirschfeld, published trans-affirming medical studies and they burned his research. Many years later, Judith Butler published a series of essays discussing the social science of gender, which many trans people feel reflects their reality. Butler is also Jewish and has been called both antisemitic slurs and a self-hating Jew because of her support for Palestine. Treating  the Jewish community as a monolith that must support Israel is a an antisemitic stereotype. <br><br>TLDR, trans-affirming peer-reviewed medical and social science has existed for at least a century. Antisemitism has been a primary reason many of the people doing this research aren‚Äôt taken seriously, thus establishing a link‚Äîsometimes circumstantial and other times direct‚Äîbetween transphobia and antisemitism. These are the facts, and they don‚Äôt care about Ben Shapiro‚Äôs feelings.

 It seems you are arguing against the idea that facts are facts, and assume Shapiro is actually using facts to back up his arguments. I think your original premise is flawed--that Shapiro is actually using facts in any way, and that he can be wrong because facts can be mired by bias.<br><br>In the same way that Trump calls actual factual news &quot;fake news&quot; to distract from the lies he tells, Shapiro claims he uses facts when in fact he uses propaganda based on his feelings. The scientific consensus has the facts. Shapiro&#39;s beliefs are not backed up by scientific consensus in any way. <br><br>He denies climate change because he doesn&#39;t want to think he&#39;s responsible for climate change, his life of dependence on fossil fuels might be causing climate change, or that he&#39;ll have to change the way he lives to do something to stop climate change. Feelings Ben, those are feelings. <br><br>He invents propaganda about differences in intelligence between sexes or races because he wants to demonize people with brown skin, as racist white people have throughout history. He also wants to think that his race is superior to other races. Feelings, Ben. Those are feelings. Etc and on and on for literally everything that comes out of this con artist&#39;s mouth hole.

 I find this amusing given recent news that a bunch of Alzheimer&#39;s research is ultimate built on initial studies that falsified data.  One person discussing it stated their own version of &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; - &quot;You can cheat your way to a degree.  You can cheat your way to getting a paper published.  You can cheat your way to a grant.  you cannot cheat your way to curing a disease - biology doesn&#39;t care.&quot;<br><br>As far as left-wing figures ignoring results, look at a lot of the stuff surrounding gender.  <br><br>For example, there had been studies suggesting that most domestic violence is bidirectional and that it&#39;s not a particularly gendered problem going back to the 70s.  Hell, it&#39;s anecdotal but the woman who opened the first UK women&#39;s refuge noted that around 2/3 of the women she took it were as violent as the men they were escaping (this is actually pretty close to what the family violence studies from the 70s and early 80s by Strauss and Steinmetz said was bidirectional) - she essentially got kicked out of her own movement for that.  Later studies solved this in one of two ways - either changing the scales so violence by women just doesn&#39;t count as being as serious or introducing a notion of &quot;retaliatory&quot; violence and then setting up methodologies that will specifically make all women&#39;s violence a reaction to men&#39;s violence (for example, taking a sample of victim&#39;s from a women&#39;s shelter and a sample of abusers from a men&#39;s prison and defining all violence by  a victim as &quot;retaliatory&quot; in a scenario where you&#39;ve already ensured that almost all abusers studied are male and almost all victims studied are women).

Some abusers use soft power, some use financial power, some use systemic power, some use emotional power, etc. the fact that a woman abuser might be able to pass herself off as a victim is a form of soft power in and of itself. Regardless, treating violence as a measure of abuse ignores the concepts of reactive violence and even of self-defense (or perceived self-defense.)']

 Im someone who values facts  and finding the truth of things. But I absolutely know that many, if not most, things I consider true may be incomplete or straight up wrong. And that is because I&#39;m human, I&#39;m flawed and I&#39;m subjective. I try to analyse things with a part of objectivity, but that doesn&#39;t mean I should get rid of emotions (first, because that&#39;s impossible) and also because they are an important part of my thought process. Heck, even science, which tries to be objective and pragmatic, can and has been flawed and subjective, because it&#39;s a human creation. <br><br>Also, in my opinion, objectivity is overrated.

 I can verify something similar as a musician; no two human beings, no matter how educated they are in whatever formal schools of music there are in the world, will ever hear the exact same piece of music that is played in front of them. The music may be played as closely as possible to the original score, if the piece was scored; but the dots, lines, flags, and various and sundry scribblings that make up formalized western notation are not the music each of us hears, just a mapping of it.  Our perceptions of music, like facts, are clouded by our feelings and the  innate biases we bring with us. Great video. Thanks for posting.

 Regarding the crime model: it isn&#39;t just the data that can be flawed. It can also be the model itself, and the assumptions used to create it. At the end of the day, you give the model inputs, it performs some kind of mathematical algorithm on those inputs, and it provides an output. The output might be the correct value of the result of the algorithm based on the input, but it is only as good as the inputs, AND it&#39;s also only as good as the algorithm. Just because the algorithm gives &quot;correct&quot; outputs doesn&#39;t mean that it is a good or valid algorithm.<br><br>The model might put too much value on criminal activity that biases arresting poorer citizens and minorities because it&#39;s only considering the types of crimes that are more commonly committed by poorer citizens and minorities. It might not be considering &quot;white collar&quot; crimes like embezzlement, fraud, laundering, tax evasion, insider trading, bribery, and so forth because it&#39;s only considering things like robberies, shoplifting, domestic violence, and so forth for which police are called. White collar crimes may not happen at the same volume as other crimes, but they are arguably more damaging to society because they have the potential to affect many more people, as they can disrupt entire industries or economies or destroy the life savings or investments of hundreds or thousands of people. <br><br>So you might have a hundred individual cases of a drug dealer selling dope in a neighborhood park that is much more valued in the model than a single case of a single corrupt banker who defrauds thousands of people all at once. A hundred drug deals is <b>technically</b> &quot;more crimes&quot; than the single bank fraud or whatever, but the bank fraud is arguably a crime of much higher magnitude.<br><br>Also, the input itself is probably fundamentally flawed. If police biases against poorer communities and minorities already existed, then you would expect those communities to be over-represented in arrests and police responses. So you target those areas for more policing, which results in more responses and arrests, and it creates a positive feedback loop.

 I don&#39;t think that assumptions and biases are types of &#39;feeling&#39;, though this isn&#39;t to say that feelings aren&#39;t relevant when we talk about facts. More than anything else, we probably need to consider feelings merely because any fact will need to be communicated to people, and we will often need to be convinced of why we should accept that fact (especially if there&#39;s some other belief we already have that we prefer). Simply telling people that they should believe something because it&#39;s true has been shown, over and over again, to be insufficient.<br><br>This being said, the central underlying premise of Shapiro&#39;s claim is still true: whether or not something is true has nothing to do with how we feel about it. Whatever the truth may be, it isn&#39;t dependent on human emotion (unless, of course, we&#39;re talking about something to do with human emotion). Shapiro is likely responding to people who take established data and try to alter it based largely on how they feel about a situation, or who try to alter the conclusion because they merely don&#39;t like the one that has been arrived at. Instead of trying to challenge this approach, we should accept it and apply it wholesale, or at least as far as we&#39;re able to.

 Shapiro is probably the most emotionally unstable snowflake I&#39;ve ever seen. I remember how he freaked out during his interview with Andrew Neil on abortion.

 Models are imperfect, but can be refined, and objectively analyzed.  For instance, the crime stats could be weighted but the inverse of patrol rates in the area (in other words, build in an assumption that more patrols equals more arrests).  And from there, establishing a platform for metanalysis so we can judge if our model changes have decreased bias or not.  This is actually the very basis of the scientific method.<br><br>Also, there&#39;s a bit of conflation here.  Because the bleeding edge of science is (by design) in flux, all science is equally unsettled.  There may be some issue of popular science, particularly sociological, work prematurely being presented as closer to law than theory then it is.  But that doesn&#39;t mean it is reasonable to overgeneralize and say all knowledge is subjective or subject to bias.  Just because we are still working on building quality AI models doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s reasonable to think 5G causes cancer or vaccines cause autism, for instance.

 I struggle with the idea of working to countermand my biases after acknowledging them.  I can acknowledge that I have a very strong leftist bias.  I am distrustful of of anything that claims to be neutral, and outright hostile to anything that claims to be conservative.  I don&#39;t automatically assume anything leftist is accurate, but a leftist lean is almost a prerequisite for me to take it seriously.  I don&#39;t really <i>want</i> to consider non-leftist viewpoints anymore.  I have heard so many of them and I have seen so many debunked, and they just seem inherently unjust to me now, that to even consider them anymore seems like a step backwards, a waste of my mental energy.  After all, there are PLENTY of conflicting leftist positions to argue and compare.  To consider a position from &quot;the right&quot; to me seems like a morbid exercise in futility, and to consider a purportedly centrist or neutral view seems to be, at best, missing the key framework to give necessary meaning to the subject.

 OK miss English teacher.<br>Do you agree this is a fact, or a feeling: Genes are replicated during mitosis (cell division), gene replication can cause a mutation, that mutation can cause cancer?<br>I think these are facts, no matter how much a cancer victim feels like they want to be in remission.<br><br>(please don&#39;t mark my grammar, it&#39;s a fact that I preferred science over English at school)

You are so pathetic you can&#39;t even discern that she is talking about specifically certain data sets being subject to human error, what you are talking about is not the same. You also seem to ignore all of the disclaimers in her video saying that what you are discussing is really not what she is referring to.

It&#39;s nothing. Because facts have to be factual by definition. And you can define facts which is why we know how cells divide, how mutations in genes occur and how to treat the cancers they cause.

 Facts can only be objective, if every bit of data is acounted for, not just what is possible for our meger brains to understand, but also the data that is incomprehensible to the minds of mortal understanding. Even then however, while objectivity may have been reached, still to execute them as objective is unobtainable, as those who execute the use of these purely objective facts, will still execute them in an objective manner.

Im not hear to deal with &quot;What if life is a simulation&quot;  or &quot;What if Lincoln was a black or a women or gay and all the paintings are lies&quot;  I am hear to accept the reality I chose to accept based on how reasonable I MY SELF feel it is that multiple painters and photographers all unanimously agreed to forge there own work to preserve a lie for all of History.  I don&#39;t actually care what killed the Dinosaurs or if they all some how lived or if they even existed all that matters is I never met one so I shall assume them all dead and nothing you say will make me believe that they had space ships <br><br>but the thing is BOTH the guy who says a Comit hit the Earth AND they guy who says they all got saved by the Ark they BOTH present there argument with FACTS , evidence, science , professors, studies  etc and they both debunk the other guy with more facts. <br>Then the UFO guy and the Disposures never existed guy they both have facts too.<br><br>at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t care.<br><br>I&#39;ll tell you a fact, there are more dinosaurs in museums then in my back yard So I shall create my own reality around those two facts and if you want to say otherwise you are free to do so, just don&#39;t tell me the Earth is Flat and the Dinosaurs all fell off.  Because my mind refuses to hear any more facts  Im not hurting any one, Your not hurting any one lets both just respect each other rather then being stubborn. <br><br>now if you want to discuss your views calmly I&#39;ll explain why I have my views and allow you to counter point but no matter how many facts you have , I have made up my mind and you have to show me some thing amazing to sway me some thing solid, some thing supported buy things that make my brain want to agree with yours. <br><br>But I am not going to tell you that you are wrong.

Becoming scientifically dogmatic is what&#39;s happened more and more during our era since the early 1900&#39;s and is ongoing to the present. <br><br>My point here is this: Science is to be understood.<br><br>One must have an understanding of science. <br>One must always question the base assumptions.

I just think having &quot;faith&quot; in Science is a path to stagnation, regression even, and sometimes danger.<br><br>E.g. How on TV they tend to state things as &quot;facts&quot; when they&#39;re strictly theoretical constructions with little to no observational, and definitely no experimental, proof. They should be saying something like this beforehand on such ideas: &quot;Based on the theoretical research and consensus, limited to no observation and experimentation, as of now, we think THIS is the most likely cause or is what is likely happening&quot;, instead of stating such things as KNOWN facts, which I see happening a lot on mainstream science coverage.<br><br>Yes, science truly progresses through hard work, and this is due to people actually understanding the Scientific Method, and APPLYING it. We&#39;ve gone so far outside of this in some areas, that it&#39;s nothing short of ludicrous. Experiment triumphs theory every time. Without experimental data and proof, it&#39;s just decent speculation. Even observation has issues as someone can interpret it differently than another person. I see too much reliance on pure theory after QM came into being - and I think that&#39;s because it was so wildly successful; but this doesn&#39;t mean any theory will be successful. Yes, Physics is Mathematical; but not all Mathematics is Physical. There are places where they say, &quot;Oh! Our theory says that shouldn&#39;t be there, so we are going to ignore it&quot; or worse &quot;Oh! Our theory doesn&#39;t conform to reality, so let&#39;s keep slapping on bandages that keep the theory alive even though we have more than enough evidence refuting the fundamental claims of said theory. Why? Because... Our funding! Our jobs!&quot; - Scientists NEED to be free to speculate, but they really are only allowed to in certain areas. It&#39;s not most of the scientists faults, but the system itself.<br><br>When it comes to trust - look at pharmaceutical company claims (Opiate addiction rates quoted as less than 1%, and, what I think few people know is, about at least one of the top cholesterol-lowering medications being actually about 1% difference in outcomes, vs the quoted much higher percentage), the fossil fuel companies when it comes to recycling and other obvious things that need not be mentioned. But this, with most everything else, is a product of unchecked Capitalism - profit at any cost, be it human life, stagnation of progress, destruction of the environment, etc. In this case, all testing should be done third party, funded by third party; right now, it&#39;s not. There are a lot of cases of massive conflicts of interest in this area. I don&#39;t inherently trust experiments conducted by such entities testing their own products - they must be verified by someone without any skin in the game, and then it needs to happen more than just 1-2 times.']

And if the model of violent crimes happens to also show poor neighbourhoods have higher incidence of violent crimes, then that&#39;s not being classist, or a sign that you necessarily should overpolice those areas, but that you should address the root cause of violent crime in those areas, which is usually a combination of:<br>- poverty (having to steal to get by and being more likely to get into fights while in robbery)<br>- drug addiction (including alcohol addiction)<br>- lead poisoning (poor neighbourhoods have higher concentrations of lead in the paint cause the houses are usually old, lead poisoning is shown to cause aggression and lowered IQ)<br>- lack of support for women to get abortions or birth control (having too many kids increased poverty and means kids are more likely to be left alone without parental supervision as the mother needs to work to survive)<br>- lack of affordable mental health services <br>- lack of meaningful community ties aside from gangs for the youth<br>Etc<br><br>All issues that the state can help rectify.

 Big Data as a field of computer science can be great for figuring out things like marketing trends or even finding solutions to different major problems in the world, but the moment we begin using Big Data in a way that can directly impact the lives of groups of people, we need to begin questioning what other approaches are also being used to make sure that no harm comes from the faulty assumptions influenced by a machine that absolutely cannot draw a perfect conclusion from the data input into it. It can be very easy to make data say what you want when you can select what data is taken as an input, and even if you aren&#39;t overly selective with your data, it&#39;s very possible to find correlations that while technically true, just don&#39;t accurately depict the full story.

 I&#39;ve been saying &quot;Facts might not care about your feelings, but what&#39;s really important is that feelings don&#39;t care about your facts.&quot; for a long time, and I&#39;m sorta mad that you came up with the same antimetabole.<br><br>I think people really like the aesthetic of rationality. I&#39;ve described Ben Shapiro as having big &quot;smartest kid in 7th grade&quot; energy, and as someone with yearbooks filled with comments like &quot;Billy, you are smart.&quot; I get it, I&#39;ve been there. I hope it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m bragging or anything, because looking back, it&#39;s sorta depressing that that was basically my whole identity, both to myself and to others.<br><br>But 7th grade was a long time ago. I&#39;ve had a lot of experiences, worked in a lot of fields, met a lot of people. I served in the US Navy, and learned a lot about security and processes in addition to my actual job working on radios. A big moment for me was going through security training on my ship, learning about the importance of presenting a &quot;hard target&quot; in order to deter attacks, then later reading a research paper from the RAND corporation about how terrorists choose targets. In the much more sophisticated RAND analysis, they created several different profiles or categories of attacker, and certainly some profiles would be deterred by a guard who appears to be armed (but in reality has no ammunition.) But some of the most dangerous attackers enthusiastically seek out targets that seem hard but have critical vulnerabilities, the USS Cole being their prime example. What target is harder than floating weapon?<br><br>I also learned about operations research, the classic picture of a bomber covered in red dots showing where surviving bombers were hit, and how it actually justifies increasing armor on the areas that didn&#39;t get hit, because the planes that got hit there didn&#39;t make it back to be included in the data.<br><br>I guess my point is that the aesthetic of facts and logic is pretty and clean. It&#39;s a beautiful world of spherical cows that follow perfect parabolic paths through the sky. One can imagine themselves holding up a torch in a darkened room getting a true picture of what was once hidden. But the reality of facts and logic is such a messy disaster, it&#39;s the sort of thing that can cause an existential crisis. It&#39;s less like a torch, and more like having a glitchy laser-pointer and a crappy polaroid camera. With a lot of systematic and careful work you can sorta figure out what&#39;s out there, you get a sense of just how much you don&#39;t actually know.<br><br>But to go back to the security stuff, I learned a lot about deception, and it helped because the teenage me was really into stuff like Skeptic magazine and all the online Atheism stuff before it shifted gears to Gamergate and anti-feminism. The big thing about deception, scams and con-artistry is that they take advantage of the assumptions we don&#39;t realize we make, and the emotional weaknesses that we don&#39;t realize (or admit, even to ourselves) that we have. I&#39;ve heard that smart people, engineers, scientists, etc., can fall for scams much harder than anyone else. They&#39;re incredibly good at coming up with strong arguments for why they need to send just one more check to rescue that wealthy prince who&#39;s going to send them a reward when they get back home. And as a double-whammy, they&#39;re emotionally unprepared to handle the humiliation, and our brains are very good at protecting ourselves.<br><br>Wow! Paragraphs! Hope somebody reads this and enjoys it. If not, I had fun writing it. Either way +1 point for the engagement algorithm.

 I get what her point is, but it is not exactly related to what she is saying, I mean if x person states, the sky is blue, it is not feelings, unless we use complex philosophy and that all realities are different, etc. then we would be delving too deep and could literally state reality itself doesn&#39;t exist.

 Stating that &quot;The numbers speaks for themselves&quot; is true, if someone states crime is high in New York, and shows data of how many crimes occur, and it is high relative to other areas, then the data literally speaks for itself. The only time this or &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about feelings&quot; is if someone does this in response to why they conclude x thing. Which is what Ben Shapiro is referring to. In fact I have rarely ever heard him state that in response to something and can literally name the researchers and article title on command.

 Again the statement models, in reference to policing is impartial is absurd. It gets crime data input, and determines the highest crime areas, of which are consistent in relation to other areas in most cases. It is not absurd policing occurs in areas where crimes are more likely to occur.

 As for the reference to William Heim, his processes were not traditional and are criticized, but the further point is that you or specifically the quote reads that it increases the arrest of a subgroup, but that is meaningless if they are actually committing crime. In fact, homeless people are indeed more likely to commit crimes, although typically petty. As for minority communities, the only consistency between them is fatherhood, as black communities are far less likely to have a father. With research showing that black people who were poor, in the &quot;ghetto&quot;, but had a father, were in fact slightly less likely to commit a crime than a child with a wealthier family (100k+) and no father. Thus they found that they found fatherhood is in fact more important than wealth in regard to crime, with in fact further study showing dozens more problems, and is referred to as &quot;Perpetual Fatherlessness&quot; and is a huge problem. In fact fatherless children are far less likely to finish  highschool, get a good job, and more likely to kill themselves 3x.

 Again she fails, again as a Criminologist, yes crime model applications are used, but they are used among many different applications, not to mention in the studies for such applications across states and cities, they consistently reduce crime rate. Not to mention, in multiple studies regarding what the optimal amount of police was, determined that less police produces more crime, and depending on the study, they compared form the start the 3 and the more police the better. Or they took a high police area and recued it, resulting in more crime. Not to mention in todays 2022 as this video is a bit old, the many cities that restricted police funding have all drastically increased in crime. With Gallup polls showing poor  or black communities want more police, at approximately 70-74 percent and 21% wanting less, and the remaining few didn&#39;t care. 

 	Replies: ['Benjamin Walburn', 'Your claims here have been disproven elsewhere. Less policing doesn&#39;t produce more crime, and &quot;restricted&quot; funding doesn&#39;t increase crime either.

 Again I make a comment, I clarify for this one, that this does not justify any racism for any of you racist dumbasses, but their is indeed an IQ difference between races. A can&#39;t recall the exact numbers, thus we will be relative, but Asians are approximately 5-7 points higher than whites, whites 11 points higher that Hispanic, and blacks 8-10 points lower than Hispanics. (I didn&#39;t mention, but only those with nearly the exact same variables were used, social class, money, parents.) Other minorities were not studied as much, but they are between Hispanics and Whites. In response to this research critics formed a new study by comparing black and white IQ and test scores to South America. But, the researchers were surprised to find that even in South America (Which is actually primarily black ran, for some reason many think it is Hispanic ran), that the IQ difference was indeed the same, with the minority whites still holding the highest IQ&#39;s and test scores. But what is more odd, is they found that for whites as social class rises, their test scores do, clearly this makes sense as one would think, but for blacks it actually did not increase as much, as on the lower financial levels, whites had an approximate higher score, for example the SAT, of 100 points, but as it rose to $200,000 the difference rose steadily to 150 points.

 Even though it‚Äôs been a year since this video came out I do wanna she‚Äôs some light on recent situations, And some ones that have been going on for years now. People often use the Bible phrase ‚Äúman shall not sleep with mankind the same as woman it is an abomination‚Äù (this is not exact do not come from me) to support the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that being part of the lgbtq community is wrong and you should ‚Äúrepent‚Äù and turn to Jesus because died on the cross for us. But in reality that is only how you feel. The people who translated every version of the Bible were not experts in Hebrew which is what the Bible was originally written in. There was an expert in Hebrew who translated that phrase and it is about pedophillia. But the fact still remains that ‚Äúyou will go to hell if your lgbtq‚Äù because that‚Äôs how people feel. They feel that is wrong so it became a fact people often use against lgbtq people. And for the people who don‚Äôt follow or believe in the Bible there are situations you can‚Äôt deny I only explain one of them here and there are undeniably many, many, more. Roe v Wade was recently overturned and a lot of states have made abortion illegal because the ‚Äúfact‚Äù is ‚Äúgetting an abortion is wrong because you are killing a baby‚Äù which is generally why it was overturned. But in reality there are many reasons why this isn‚Äôt a fact. There are circumstances where the mother can‚Äôt have the child because 1. The mother or child or both would be killed during birth 2. The mother can‚Äôt financially take care of the child 3. The mother is too young and it is a life changing thing (if they are a teenager or younger) 4. If they are a victim of any type of SA or r/pe. But the fact still is ‚Äúabortion is wrong and should be banned‚Äù because that‚Äôs how people feel their judgement is clouded by biases like ‚Äúoh well your killing a baby that‚Äôs wrong‚Äù or ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not the baby‚Äôs fault the mother got pregnant‚Äù causing the overturning. <br>Anyone who has anything else to say say it in the comments but please, do not say anything hateful or hurtful, this comment is another example of facts so care about your feelings because I feel these things.

Its failure as a model per se, may only manifest in its application but say nothing of the veracity of the facts supporting it in control groups. &quot;Weapons of math destruction&quot; is a great critique in how politicisation of modelling can be misapplied to support a bias, but it fails to answer its own question of if stats are inherently biased. The process in which science and math advances is in cumulative experience and repetitive results. If one were to design a model that lacks either of these characteristics while producing inconsistent  results, it would be fair discredit that model until it has been improved produce consistent results. Im finding it very difficult to understand the level and nature of your experience of statistical and scientific modelling. <br><br>My grandmother belives the earth is roughly 12,000 years based on her TRUSTED sources and geneological modeling based on biblical assumptions. The process does mirror the scientific method in some ways, but facts are based in demonstrable and repetitive evidence. Is it a fact that the bible is the word of god inspired unto man? We have no way of proving that since becsuse it relies on an assumtion, which is differrnt in nature than a hypothesis.

318: Eta Carinae 
 I don&#39;t feel this video is precisely clear. Let me try to elucidate: &quot;feelings&quot; is a bad term here. It sounds as though one&#39;s perception of the facts is laddened with the ephemerality of how early they may have woken up - that was your argument; I was looking for precisely where you said &quot;What I am saying...&quot; - which is not true. I&#39;m sure you may very well feel that you can react to bad news differently depending on the mood, and that would constitute proof, but you cannot just conflate the reaction to a fact with the fact itself. It doesn&#39;t <i>matter</i> what your perceptions are, facts are <i>public.</i> Take some fact as an object, say a definite description - any will do - like &quot;the summit of Mount Everest is located [insert whatever the latitude/longitude coords. for the location of the summit of Mt. Everest is here]&quot;. Tell me how this fact permutes across any of the dimensions you talked about - I understand that such a fact is sensitive to <i>some</i> factors, but not those you could call &#39;feelings&#39;. Instead, use the term &quot;values&quot;, as a steelman. Your arguments work better in this form, and my response to this is deeper. I think there is cause to undermine the fact/value distinction: facts and values are not mutually disjoint i.e. some values are facts, and some facts are values. This means of the set of values, some values are objective (taking <i>objective</i> to simply be what is the case, as Wittgenstein defined it). Those values inform what scientists do, and the manner they do it in. In this sense, it&#39;s not so much that &quot;facts <i>don&#39;t</i> care about values&quot;, but often times it more depends on the fact/value pair under consideration, since they can be identified with eachother in certain cases. In those cases, they may - after all, it&#39;s not difficult to find a fact that cares about another fact. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not clear; the question is underspecified given considerations of the fact/value distinction. Using Gould to undermine <i>that</i> would be silly. &quot;The best form of objectivity lies in explicitly identifying preferences so that their influence can be countermanded...&quot;. Oh, is that &quot;best&quot; a fact? To Gould, in the context of the quote, yes it is.<br><br>EDIT: One more thing. Where was the explication of your own biases in this video? Not a fan of Ben, but you&#39;d advocated him stating as much - if that&#39;s a misquote I both apologise and ask: were you satisfied with your identification of your own biases? And maybe more pertinent to what <i>I&#39;d</i> hope to prescribe: are you satisfied with your identification of <i>their</i> biases? Do you think they would be?<br><br>Also I realise I am late

 Well technically &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is true, taken at face value, facts can&#39;t care about anything.<br><br>That said, you&#39;re talking about statistics which actually have very little to do with any actual facts. Statistics are extremely easy to manipulate to get whatever results the person collecting the data is trying to find. It&#39;s been demonstrated over and over again that statistics really aren&#39;t reliable because weather we&#39;re aware of it or not our own personal feelings will always effect the results of the data we get from Statistics.<br><br>If you feel like cops are being racist you collect data from neighborhoods where the population is mostly black and of course you&#39;re going to get statistics that confirm what you already suspected. However if you conducted the exact same study in an area that is mostly white you&#39;d have the exact opposite results. This is because realistically it makes sense that the majority of people wrongfully arrested for a crime they didn&#39;t commit are going to match whatever the majority of the population is in that area. This doesn&#39;t mean that the police are targeting a specific race it actually means that your sample size was too small and limited to really give you an accurate picture.<br><br>This also happens with statistics regarding genders, people think that women are far more likely to suffer some form of trauma but actually what&#39;s really happening is that the statistics are only capable of collecting data from people who are already in therapy and can&#39;t possibly predict the true number of people who are still suffering in silence. Men are taught that they should be stronger, that seeking help is a sign of weakness, and because of that men are less likely to seek out therapy and it&#39;s harder to find therapy even if they do seek it out. <br><br>There&#39;s also quite a number of studies and statistics people still circulate as facts even when they were proven fraudulent and some times even the original researcher who conducted the study in the first place admitted they made a mistake. They&#39;re still circulated because they help people support what they believe to be true even though we know that statistics don&#39;t actually prove anything.<br><br>Ben Shapiro is also a total hypocrite considering he also believes things that aren&#39;t true and ignores facts in favor of his own feelings when ever it suits him. Generally I think he&#39;s a pretty intelligent person a lot of the time but he&#39;s also a just as fallible as anyone else and falls into the same traps that everyone else does. No one is perfect, no one knows everything, and everyone at some point, intentionally or not, is susceptible to putting their feelings first even when the facts say they&#39;re wrong.

 Another thing I think is important about this is that this &quot;objectivity and logic is superior to feelings and emotions&quot; has a lot of mysoginistic connotations to it. The logical, impartial man is superior to and knows better than the emotional, hysterical woman. And it connects to the perceived superiority of sciences over humanities and arts, of scientists pushing out sociologists and political scientists because that&#39;s not &quot;real&quot; science. Which is problematic in and of itself, but also you have people in those fields (quite reasonably!) wanting to be considered scientists, when what&#39;s wrong with humanities? Why is it more desirable to be a science than an art? These are just some thoughts (coming from a CS student who is fascinated by arts and humanities)

 Ben Shapiro is correct that facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, but equally true feelings don&#39;t care about facts. Assuming the MBTI has any actual relevance. As an INFJ I have seen both motives in how I process information. I can affirm things that are emotionally charged can have their own merit, but are far less rational and reasonable then calming down and examining the situation with as little emotional influence as possible.<br><br><br>The issue with attributing bias on &quot;political issues&quot; is that most of them are moral issues and there is deep objective truths behind them. Science doesn&#39;t prove or disprove much, without undeniable evidences. Science exists to observe. As the Lord says, Seek and you will find, as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. If one chooses to entirely write off the possibility of a divine creator, they shall never find one. No matter the amount of time observing, contrasty one who sees God in everything cannot be convinced otherwise.¬†<br><br><br>&quot;I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else&quot; C.S. Lewis<br><br><br>Atheists. For argument&#39;s sake let&#39;s for a moment assume maybe the Christians are right. If there is a creator of this universe. If He is a personal God as Christians have observed. Then He very much cares about every thought or action, taken or not taken. He has to determine right from wrong because He is the standard or what right is and as C.S. Lewis puts it, sin is goodness spoiled. This would mean that regardless of my emotions or beliefs on stealing. That it is actually wrong, universally wrong, and I oughtn&#39;t have done it. Choosing to continue in wrong behaviors gradually kills us because we were created with the purpose of being holy like God. To do anything less is to take away the life we have and replace it with all that remains, death. For all life came from God, and eternal life can come nowhere, but from a relationship and right standing with the eternal God and one aspect of this God is truth. In the beginning was the logos (logic) the logos was with God and the logos was God.<br><br><br>So yes, truth doesn&#39;t care about your feelings. Feelings don&#39;t care about truth, but the God behind it does care deeply about you, but will not force you to have a relationship with Him. My greatest ought against Ben Shapiro is for such a brilliant mind, he is lacking in love (agape). A love that His messiah wants to share with Him and any that will repent and follow Him.

 Your whole argument applies to subjective facts perhaps, but they are objective facts that don&#39;t care about your feelings. If I go up to Mount everest and throw a person off, he is going to fall and die. No interpretation or bias will make a diffrence. Same goes for things like men giving birth. You as as a lady can give birth because you have a womb, no womb no giving birth. You guys like to complicate issues. When Ben talks about facts not caring about your feelings he is talking about objective facts. There are millions of facts that are not affected by the bias of the researcher. It is a fact that men and women are not tge same biologically, we do not have identical organs or strength or hormones. Facts like these don&#39;t care about your feelings or the interpretation of the researcher even a five year old can see that hisom and Dad are diffrent. Let me given another example, between YouTube and twitch it is up for debate which platform is better, but it is a fact that they are not the same platform niether do they run on the same code, niether do they do the sane things equally well. So if I come and tell you YouTube and twitch are not the same your feelings or mine are irrelevant and have no bearing on the fact that they are not the same, our feelings would have a bearing on which is better between the two but not on what they are or what they do or the code they run on, or who owns them.

 Thank you for providing this distillation of something I sensed but could never put my finger on. I cringe every time Shapiro and his ilk start spouting that ersatz tough-guy bullshit about why it&#39;s acceptable and even laudable to (say) bully trans kids in public schools. (Speaking of which, the cowardice of bullies is evident in how these adult men always seem to be picking fights with schoolchildren.) There was a comment in which calculus was mentioned, and I thought I detected either a light-hearted distaste for or modest distancing from mathematics in general. I wouldn&#39;t disparage any English professor for lacking expertise in solving differential equations (and I don&#39;t remember any of my English professors expressing interest in the subject). If you&#39;re ever curious about what is so revolutionary, mind-blowing and frankly beautiful about calculus as a way of modelling natural physical processes, might I suggest &quot;A Tour of the Calculus&quot; by David Berlinski (Pantheon, 1997)? It provides a good sense of the purpose of the derivative and the integral from a standpoint that is comfortable for humanities-based inquiry. <br><br>Anyway, thank you for saying these things. I was bullied in school (for being gay, not trans, but it seems when I got bigger and cut a more imposing frame, Shapiro&#39;s ilk moved on to easier prey) and I take it personally today whenever I hear about adults providing an excuse, a defense or an escape route for school bullies. The suggestion that bullying is somehow a good thing is infuriating.

 You know about external world scepticism and everything, and that the only thing you have even the faintest chance of trusting and really believing is yourself, your personal perception and your memory, which you can&#39;t even really trust since your mind can be messed with by things like memory loss and chemicals. Thus, pretty much everything that isn&#39;t purely logical or abstract, like numbers and various forms of logic, can&#39;t be accurately accessed and registered. There is literally no reason to think that properties of truth actively monitor and pander to the particular, behaviour-altering chemical reactions in arbitrary compositions of quanta constituting your brain in some sort of ethereal, metaphysical way in a universe with exactly one time dimension where all iterations of quantum interactions coexist, transtemporally simultaneously. Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.<br><br>Okay I&#39;m going over even my own head (maybe it&#39;s just my sentences being too long with me having ADHD), but, basically, facts (various assessments of reality that are true) do exist, but we can&#39;t truly access them. If they cared about how we felt, what would they even do to change the way we feel? If they made us omniscient, and absolutely sure of the external world (as well as literally every other thing in mathematics), I&#39;m pretty sure it would make us transemotional, cease to care and just be inactive existing with all the knowledge of everything. Not only would they obviously not do anything if they care how we feel, but the whole notion itself is just disingenuous. It&#39;s like saying the number 3 cares about your teddy bear (which will inevitably disintegrate in future).<br><br>That&#39;s why we have to use the scientific method to approximate facts as accurately as we can muster ourselves to do. We can only use facts once they&#39;ve been processed with our feelings. There&#39;s no way a being who has to perceive in order to understand can be objective. If you&#39;re perceiving something that isn&#39;t, just, like omniscient knowledge, there&#39;s no way to tell if what you&#39;re perceiving is real (external world scepticism). So of course numbers don&#39;t lie, but they are processing the data you&#39;re training them with (rather than the actual reality you&#39;re trying to get them to process). So if they&#39;re wrong about something, either you&#39;ve given them bad training data because of bias or incorrection, or the number emulator (your computer) has been corrupted somewhere by an electron fizzling out, glitching everything by a single bit. It&#39;s more important (dare I say) to ask the right questions, rather than get the right answers. The latter is way easier, but if the question was wrong, the answer will be wrong in the sense that it isn&#39;t what you were looking for. It can definitely be correct relative to the question, or close, but facts don&#39;t mean anything if you don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s inquiring them or aren&#39;t going to do anything about them.

 To me, the biggest proof that facts DO care about your feelings was a researcher who wanted to prove gender dysphoria was a trend, so she interview parents of trans people, who told her their kids had never displayed any type of gender non-conforming  behavior until seeing it on TV or having a classmate come out, to which she created the &quot;diagnosis&quot; of &quot;Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria&quot;.<br>Problem is: she took her sample of parents from transphobic forums on the internet, most of the parents in that forum had been neglectful to their kids regarding their gender identity, some even had kicked their children out of the house or spanked them for playing with toys that didnt align with gender expectations. Her methodology was biased from the get-go and now her research is used by alt-righters to diminish trans identity.

 Certain instances that I‚Äôve seen him use that phrase like when someone is arguing that men can get pregnant, he responds with that and says no, it‚Äôs in fact impossible for that to happen.   <br>Which I don‚Äôt think is a thing anyone can reasonably argue, if you can be pregnant, you‚Äôre a woman.

 Great Video, because this is actually at the core of the moral obliqueness of Shapiro. I have seen some of his debates and he just fast talks over very strong and biased claims that you actually would need to prove first. It is just a mentalists trick, linguistic sleight of hand slipping in claims disguised as facts and make the debate on the foundation of his false fabricated claims.<br>Finally someone that calls that out, i can never stand watching his debates to the end because nobody seems to spot this and call him out right then and there.

 Yeah but science has to find an objective and impartial truth and what your saying is that that&#39;s impossible which it isn&#39;t, for example water is a liquid and the earth is spherical, to clarify I don&#39;t think facts involving social issues involving science are an exception to this rule especially considering the fact that different scientists in the same fields have different biases and must come to an objective and impartial truth or else it will be subjective and subjective truths are most dangerous involving social issues. This is not to say that I&#39;m denying that data can be biased which is a problem  but that facts as a whole must be absolute in order to move forward in any subject otherwise you&#39;re just guessing. To clarify I&#39;m saying that your video is actually about how facts influenced by biases do care about your feelings (which I agree with btw) and you should retitle it.

 I don&#39;t agree with the premise of the video, nor the example you give.<br><br>The example of crime data I think is a very ignorant view to say that the numbers are bias towards the poor, I have lived in poor areas and less poor areas in my local government areas and I can say that the &quot;poor&quot; areas that are selected to have high crime rates, don&#39;t have high crime rates because of panhandling or because there are more Police there, there is more crime there because the inhabitants of the area are into things that make crime (drugs, alcohol abuse, domestic violence etc.). The easiest way to fix your &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot; example is to just filter the crimes by type that you want to target, and i&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll still come up with similar results, generally speaking poorer areas have a higher crime rate and I think arguing this as bias is disingenuous.<br><br>While I do watch some of Ben Shapiro&#39;s stuff I don&#39;t like the way he debates a lot of the time but I don&#39;t agree that you have shown anything about why facts care about feelings, the only thing you have shown is that your feelings are hurt by facts.

 I guess an interesting point too is the value we put on certain facts. For example, in the great debate about the best tank of WW2 (yes, I‚Äôm a nerd, sue me), people will argue that the Panther was the best tank because it had the best armour and best gun, and they‚Äôd be right (broadly). On the other hand, people will argue that the Sherman was the best because it was so easy to produce and super survivable, and they‚Äôd also be right. In the end, they‚Äôre both valid reasons for being the best, but it depends on what you feel is the most valuable attribute for it to have.

 Ok, now that I&#39;ve heard all that you have to say, I disagree with you on your claim that facts somehow do care about your feelings. They don&#39;t, and here&#39;s why.<br>You claim that our feelings influence the observations we pay attention to, and from the remaining observations we determine what is factual. This might be true in a theoretical vacuum, but we live in a world where there are as many feelings and opinions as there are people. Therefore, also in theory, the broader a range you have of opinions, when they all agree on something, the more likely it is that the something is indeed a fact...<br><br>But then there are truly divisive issues that nobody agrees on, like abortion. This is where I see two main philosophies, and they are polar opposites. Who is responsible for your lot in life? What is your reaction to stimuli?<br><br>Imagine two kids on the playground. Kid A pushes kid B, so that kid B falls down. Kid B then stands up, chases down kid A, and pushes him down. Kid A then starts crying because he&#39;s upset. We&#39;re not going to play the blame game here or get the adults involved. Kid B owns the situation while kid A acts like a victim of circumstances. This is why both the political left and right call each other jerks, I think, because we all are. We&#39;re human, get over it. The objective truth in this theoretical situation is that kid B is up and playing again while kid A is still whining about being on the ground.

 I am a fan of Ben Shapiro, but I love this video. Very well put, and for the ‚Äúunder qualified English teacher‚Äù you somewhat greeted us as, you actually nailed it. As a psychology student (high school, not college), I have looked at critical thinking and subjective objectivity more this year than ever before in my life. The fact is (and I think we can all agree), since everyone has these biases, everyone judges everything based on their biases. In other words, no matter where you lean on the political/religious spectrum on any issue, you are just as guilty of bias as anyone else, right?<br><br>I have no problems with people who have other opinions, so long as those opinions have been researched. An informed opinion, if you will. I clicked on this video not looking to disagree, but because it stood out as an opinion contrary to my own. It is not only important and educational but healthy to listen to contrasting opinions and learn from those who have them. Critical thinking is an incredible tool, and no matter how subjective we are at our core, it is essential to at least try to see things from as many angles as possible.<br><br>Honestly, though, it‚Äôs hard to give an opinion on topics like this, because the very legitimacy of that opinion is in question.

And I don‚Äôt pride myself on being logical nor did I say I did, I just pride myself on trying to be and as I said earlier it is something of recent development so yes, my views are still primarily right leaning. I did not say he was a revolutionary. I could have been better with my phrasing, but what I admire him for is that, even though he insults and ridicules people who disagree with him, he has demonstrated that he knows what he believes and why he believes it and can defend his beliefs in an argument, even if he is completely wrong. From where I stand, what he says, a lot of the time, seems to make a lot of sense. Not all of it, but a lot of what I‚Äôve heard, which again is not everything he‚Äôs ever said. I do recall his remarks about people‚Äôs looks and I never thought that was right. Again, I don‚Äôt hold him on a pedestal like the epitome of humanity and I don‚Äôt think that just because it leaves his mouth means it‚Äôs true or kind or any of that. He obviously likes to flaunt his IQ and no, that isn‚Äôt cool.<br><br>I don‚Äôt believe science and politics are purely based on emotions. But I mean, Zoe‚Äôs video is literally about our biases influencing how we interpret and select data, so take her as a more leftist opinion, it does to some extent. But what I really meant by what I said, though again the phrasing wasn‚Äôt great, was that when it comes to arguments and a chance to educate, people too often seem to retreat and through down, as she put it, a smokescreen to avoid backlash by hurling insults about appearance, intelligence, racist beliefs or what have you. I‚Äôm not horribly interested in if those claims are try for the sake of this point. What‚Äôs important is that when you do this, you deprive the other person as well as anyone listening of the opportunity to hear what you have to say. Know what you believe, know why you believe it, and be able to defend that opinion to the best of your ability. At least then your argument won‚Äôt seem so shallow, because I‚Äôm willing to bet it isn‚Äôt. Again, Ben doesn‚Äôt do this always. He does throw insults around quite a bit. But he has demonstrated on numerous occasions that he can, however misinformed he may be. You have also shown that you can defend an argument. You have clearly done your research on Ben Shapiro and what kind of comments he makes and you know how you feel about that. That is something I can respect, even knowing not much more about you.<br><br>I can‚Äôt make you like me. It isn‚Äôt important to me that I‚Äôm liked, either. You can say whatever you want about me, you are entitled to your opinions of my opinions. But it doesn‚Äôt mean much, really, because everything you know of me at this point is gleaned from three YouTube comments. 90% of communication is nonverbal, so not only do you have little to no knowledge of me as a person outside of these comments, you don‚Äôt have the tone of voice, facial expressions or body language that people use to form first impressions before anything has even been said. We are both working off of limited knowledge of each other, and for that reason, if you choose to reply, I will not reply to your comment. Life is too complicated to get caught up in aimless arguments with people you will likely never meet in person.

His ‚Äúreacting to tiktok leftist cringe‚Äù bullshit videos are all him taking jabs at individuals for their appearance. <br>Remember when Ben Shapiro tweeted ‚ÄúIsraelis like to build, Arabs like to bomb‚Äù?

I‚Äôm a fan of his just because I agree with certain ideas, like how people let their emotions cloud their judgement in politics and science. It annoys me that people who likely genuinely have something to say and have a real intelligence to share would rather resort to name calling when they could speak up and communicate their ideas.

 Madame English Professor,  do you know the definition of disingenuous? How about hypocrisy?  To quote you, &quot;Analylizing the words for accuracy and intellectual honesty&quot;  1st off, dark web refers to private based web activity. Dark web isn&#39;t public domain.  Anything you can find via standard internet search is not dark web.  All of the people she named are public figures. There is no accuracy in classifying these free speech advocates as &quot;dark web intelluctuals&quot;     EPIC FAIL!!!!!   Where&#39;s your intellectual honesty?<br>.<br>You talk about statistical data being used to establish where police should patrol- true. You talk about how that data is applied- not true by severe omission of facts.  You say it creates more data for existing crimes in those areas- true. You say that the subsequent data feeds the algorithm to keep targeting those areas- a partial truth, but again severe omission of additional relevant facts (for example all of the neighborhoods where it has served to decrease crime statistics as opposed to your representation of how it just gives the appearance of more crime).   You fail to mention that the original set of data plugged into that computational system was not generated by that computational system. Was this a purposeful omission?  Be intellectually honest and ask yourself what purpose did it serve? You also fail to accurately and with intellectual honesty refer to the other data indicating that in addition to higher instances of &quot;nuisance crimes&quot; there are also  greater incidences of violent crimes in various neighborhoods. You also fail to mention that the computational data is not the sole determining factor in where to patrol. And you outright misrepresented that the entirety of data is interpreted as a whole when clearly we have individual statistics of each types of crime.<br>.<br>Your personal feelings are evident on intellectuals that can only be debunked if you accept feelings as reality; intellectuals whom you cannot debunk by using facts.  Intellectuals who analyze and cross reference the whole body of data to arrive at conclusions supported by the entire body of data, as opposed drawing conclusions based upon a subset portion of the data, and then illustrate why interpreting the entire body of data fails to support and or outright debunks current radical ideological narratives.<br>.<br>Even so people should do their own fact checking within the framework of critical thinking.  Fact checking solely for confirmation bias might make someone feel more righteous in their beliefs, but it won&#39;t reveal objective reality.  When personal reality and objective reality don&#39;t align well you can easily wind up with radical ideologies.<br>.<br>The point you failed to make, but maybe you should have-  In the absence of  critical thinking, feelings are used to justify confirmation biases.  You failed to make your point that facts don&#39;t care about feelings. What you did was make the point that feelings care about facts.<br>.<br>&quot;What you should look for instead, is someone who acknowledges that they aren&#39;t objective. That they can&#39;t be.&quot;  Then you talk about how they need to try anyway even though, according to you,  they can&#39;t be.  The reality for most people is that we can be objective,  just not always about everything, and not all of the time.  Through critical thinking, however, any one can attain a greater level of objectivity. <br>.<br>Believing that you can&#39;t be objective is a self defeating belief.  Believing that objectivity may not always be attainable in every situation is a very realistic belief.<br>.<br>The good advice given is to recognize (not acknowledge- acknowledgement is empowerment in this case) that as an individuals we all have personal biases. To work on objectivity by being aware of (not acknowledging) our biases when we &quot;judge&quot; (interpret) what data means.<br>.<br>My final question to you, Madame, is do you understand the importance, if not necessity, of using the correct and precise words to convey meaning?  Recognize vs. acknowledge &amp;  be aware of vs. acknowledge?<br>.<br>If you were one of my English students,  then you&#39;d be be failing the course.  How the administrationboard sees fit to let certain professors teach is beyond me. Must have a lot to do with their personal biases.

Even the wealthiest, if their bankaccount was locked, would go hungry. This underlying anxiety influences everything in our society. In this instance, researchers lie because they need a paycheck. Scientists lie, because they have no choice. Academics lie, because they must be viewed as <b>experts</b> to get a paycheck.

 You sound as if you would enjoy cognitive linguistics/science. I strongly recommend doing a YouTube search for George Lakoff Moral Politics and watching the first hit. Logic and reasons themselves are quite literally based on feelings, that is, brain structures that process what we feel on the surface of the skin, amongst many other things like vision, route planning, and so on. The very idea that there is objective reason that is interfered with by emotion is itself a gratuity of Cartesian enlightenment thought. Cognition is way deeper than that, and it explains how language works, too.

 I actually took a class on narratives, and how literally everything <del>including the clothes you chose to wear</del> tell stories. And just two days ago, a teacher in the lab asked me how the tests I was doing would contribute to the story I would tell in my report (both for good and for ill. We don&#39;t discard data just because it&#39;s not what we wanted to see). And case-studies can absolutely be a jumping off point for further inquiry.

 Never heard of Shapiro or his colleagues but, I&#39;ve always operated on the premise that feelings are usually trumped by facts unless the feeling was instinctually correct and it&#39;s correctness is borne out by actions, implications, data, and/or numbers.  Feelings are Scouts and their reports have to be taken with a grain of salt initially.  They can also be terrorists, so eliminating them in some cases is logical and the correct course of action.  <br>  I&#39;ve dealt with people that led with and were governed by pure emotion; they were anti-intellectual buffoons easily suspectable to the kool-aid purveyors and very annoying people.  Additionally, having been hijacked by my own emotions at times, i sometimes wish that i could freeze them such that i could see things with far more objectivity and apply the exact/correct solution such that the situational programming is bug-free in the end.

 I guess you don&#39;t subscribe to the notion that scientists pose a hypothesis, then set out to either prove it or disprove it. The end result of this research is an objective fact. If science is &quot;squishy&quot;, it would be impossible to land on the moon since the &quot;facts&quot; that got us there are only subjective and can be something different if we so choose to interpret them that way. Sorry, but I have not been convinced that science is only a set of subjective interpretations. I suspect you believe the world is suffering to end due to carbon emissions. Is that a subjective truth or an objective one? As I understand your interpretation of science, we might solve the carbon problem simply by believing it is not a problem. Since it cannot be an objective fact, it can be whatever we want it to be. Also, facts, not being living things, cannot possibly care about our feelings. Only people and, maybe animals, have the capacity to care, so the statement on face value, at least, is true.

 &quot;I&#39;m not a philosopher, I don&#39;t study metaphysics&quot;<br><br>Proceeds to repeat Kant&#39;s exact philosophy. <br>The idea that reality is obscured by your senses falls under metaphysics.<br>The idea that truth is unknowable falls under epistemology.<br>And for the record, Kant was not enlightenment. He&#39;s the man who ended the enlightenment.<br><br>Certainty does not mean omniscience. An omniscient being that is aware of everything cannot exist in reality, so your definition of certainty literally does not exist. Therefore it&#39;s a meaningless concept. Here&#39;s the actual definition of truth and certainty: Truth is a description of reality. Reality is shown to you through your senses. When all of your observations point to one conclusion then you can be certain that it is true. Your senses do not obscure the truth, they are what make knowing the truth possible. You may misinterpret reality, but that is the fault of your mind, not your senses. <br><br>Only this definition allows you to establish truth and understand reality. Kant&#39;s philosophy puts objective truth out of reach. Instead, everyone makes their own subjective truth. You are simultaneously powerless and all-powerful. Cut off from true reality but the creator of your subjective reality. With this philosophy the only way to establish &quot;truth&quot; is to take a vote to see which subjective version of the truth is the most popular. That&#39;s why Kantians always devolve into mob-rule authoritarians. Before the Weimar republic fell to the Nazis, it was ruled by thorough Kantians. When Hitler rose to power he faced zero opposition by the political and intellectual establishment. After all, truth is subjective. If most Germans agree with Hitler&#39;s version of the truth then that is the truth. The only antidote to this is the metaphysics and epistemology of Ayn Rand - That there is only one reality which exists independently from your mind; and that truth is what describes that reality.

 Model-based modern science departs heavily from the traditional view of science. Assumptions, narratives, and the particular problem one wishes to solve dictates the result coming out. And that is inevitable in a world full of uncertainty, since even a well-intended modeler cannot precisely predict which parameters will be most relevant nor what values they will become. In some cases, choosing what parameters to model and their respectively values is a political statement of itself . Experience from an energy transition modeler.

 So, there&#39;s a lot that just isn&#39;t connecting with me in this video, clearly I&#39;m biased against these points, but it could be that I&#39;m wrong, it could be that you&#39;re wrong, and it could also be that we&#39;re both wrong. Can&#39;t rule out that final possibility. Or maybe neither of us are really wrong and we just have incomplete pictures, but I digress. I&#39;m going to focus on one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=12m44s">12:44</a> in particular. I think that statement that output is dependent on input is a good summation of a lot of what you were saying here and the problems I&#39;m having here is that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything particularly noteworthy in that statement. And maybe you&#39;d agree with me here that that statement in and of itself isn&#39;t a critique of the science or stats, but rather something we have to be aware of when understanding the numbers. So now we move onto the part about police presence.<br><br>So, the part you highlight from the book starts off by basically saying the police in Reading were putting crime data in and getting crime data out, and were able to reduce burglaries by a not insignificant 23% while downsizing the department. However, and this is my own interpretation of things, afterwards someone else put poverty and racial data in and got poverty and racial data out, which means that the crime data is bad? And a lot of criticism is leveled at the crime data, that it&#39;s neither neutral nor objective, but what about the poverty and racial data? Maybe I missed the part in the video that clarified why poverty and race are relevant to policing and why simply relying on crime data is bad. Is it the underlying assumption here that poverty and race are relevant to everything? Because the issue might simply be that I reject that narrative. 

 	Replies: ['Dick Johnson', 'Well I&#39;m not going to assume you speak for the author of this video, but thanks for your response regardless. It didn&#39;t exactly answer my inquiry, it somewhat sidestepped the race issue. Poverty though, you believe that it shares a causal link to crime? I mean, that would go a long way into explaining some of the disconnect, why this narrative would sound so convincing. Although, if poverty is considered good data because it&#39;s actually poverty that causes crime, then why would race be relevant? Wouldn&#39;t any race data having to do with crime be considered to be a bad output? I feel like I&#39;m still missing something with this one.<br><br>The narrative also doesn&#39;t quite match up to the example she used. Part of the narrative she used was, based on the crime data, you send police into high crime neighborhoods, they catch more criminals simply because there are more people there to catch more crimes which then justifies sending more officers which creates a feedback loop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=12m48s">12:48</a> However, in the example she used crime actually went down fairly significantly, which would mean to me that they&#39;re actually catching less crimes. Their response is also going to have to be limited because the department was dealing with being downsized, and I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ve got to spread their resources to other parts of the city. I mean, it certainly looks inconsistent to me but how would you address it? Maybe you don&#39;t think it matters, maybe you don&#39;t even think it&#39;s relevant to the point. Would still like to get some input.', 'KohuGaly', 'Let me explain to you where the problem is with the police example. So you have a program that can accurately predict where crime is likely to occur. So now you just focus your police patrols there and boom - crime solved... right? The data sure says so... right? <br>Well, here&#39;s something that you failed to consider. The model shows that crime is most prevalent in area X and virtually absent in area Y. What&#39;s causing that? And how can we remove the cause in area X, so we don&#39;t have to patrol it so much?<br><br>The answer is pretty simple - the crime in area X is caused by people living there being more poor and thus more desperate. Patrolling that area more, doesn&#39;t solve that cause. People aren&#39;t any less desperate, they just have fewer opportunities to alleviate that desperation through criminal actions.<br>Here&#39;s a crazy thought... what if, instead of wasting money on patrolling the area more, we just give the money to the poor, so they are less desperate and thus less likely to turn to crime. We reduced crime in area X, and at the same time solved actual problems for the people living there, turning the area X to be more like the crimeless area Y.']

 I agree with the content of Ben&#39;s debates, but I usually disagree with how he actually presents his arguments. It usually doesn&#39;t actually refute the other person&#39;s arguments anyway, and it&#39;s more just shouting stuff. From what I&#39;ve heard, some of his info is often wrong too.<br><br>Jordan Peterson isn&#39;t really of the same vein, imo. Can&#39;t really explain it other than Peterson is definitely using Pathos to some degree, as he is evidently far more persuasive at convincing his opposition than Ben will ever be. I&#39;ve heard there are cases where people are actually convinced to change their minds (not necessarily in a debate, but rather the self-motivation kind).<br><br>Also have to mention that starting out by mentioning those three as &quot;Dark Web intellectuals&quot; and joking that you&#39;re not going to dunk on them because someone else already has kinda implies you&#39;re not really unbiased and objective anyway, and it sounds like you&#39;re dismissing them entirely. To me it sounds like you&#39;re already set to counter their content, and not the way they argue the content. You don&#39;t really address any of them individually so you&#39;re already grouping them all together with considering them as different people. Of course, you do shift your video away to any specific counters, but you do sound incredibly biased against them in that moment. <br><br>Ben Shapiro sucks at arguing so I&#39;ll give that a pass, but Peterson&#39;s most well-known debates are A) to argue that you can&#39;t use feelings to create <b>laws</b> top-down (legally enforcing &quot;preferred&quot; gender pronouns), he argues it should be a social agreement not a legal one (he has no problems with if someone specifically asks him to call them with a specific pronoun) and B) the logic that others use to support additional fighting for women&#39;s rights today under the presumptions that they still aren&#39;t equal are based on incorrect data (they are legally equal, and statistics are equal once it&#39;s broken down by field/age/etc) and completely ignores men (the classic &quot;Most people in prison are men. Most people who are on the street are men. Most victims of violent crime are men. Most people who commit suicide are men. Most people who die in wars are men. People who do worse in school are men. It‚Äôs like, where‚Äôs the dominance here, precisely?&quot;). <br>Peterson uses logic to counter their logic. But in his motivational talks, he weaves logos and pathos pretty well. He&#39;s mastered logos, but it&#39;s disingenuous to assume that&#39;s all he does or that&#39;s why he does it.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=4m44s">4:44</a> I&#39;ve never heard that argument from Peterson, and I believe he wouldn&#39;t make that mistake. Again, disingenuous to lump them all together. Shapiro might, as stated earlier with how Shapiro doesn&#39;t really fact check his information. But I don&#39;t think he would state that as it doesn&#39;t really help any of his arguments.<br><br>As much as feelings are what actually changes people, you can&#39;t possibly consider the feelings of 7 billion people in a law, you&#39;d need 7 billion exceptions.

 I didn&#39;t really understand the bit about crime and models, to be honest. I mean I don&#39;t see why you treat that as a problem. Models showed more crimes ocurred in poor neighbourhoods, the police started sending more cops to those poor neighbourhoods and, in the span of a year, burglers had diminished by 26%. How is that bad? How is that bad for the poor? If I lived in a poor neighbourhood, then I wouldn&#39;t be annoyed if more cops come and crime diminishes. If anything, this anecdote seems to favor the dark web-types as it shows that 1) they wanted to reduce crime, 2) they used math and logic and that kind of stuff to do it and 3) they were succesful.

Picture a neighbourhood with both rich and poor people where crime starts to rise. The rich people can easily move to other neighbourhoods, while the poor can&#39;t.

In poorer areas the number of murders happen at much higher rates especially when there‚Äôs gang and drug related cases which again are  most common in poorer areas. These are facts that are undisputed and undeniable. So the data that is fed to the system is as accurate as you can get. <br>Also some science are objectively correct no matter from which angle you look at it from. Biology is a field where research is throughly done for decades and it follows according to the scientific method which takes out majority of the biases. This is where the feeling come and say science is wrong. They talk about gender and the xy chromosomes to be a myth. <br>The story with the IQ difference between the sexes was something Jordan said if I‚Äôm not mistaken and he said that the average IQ between male and female is the same but it varies in the range. That means that female tend to be in the middle of the IQ scale while men tend to be at the extremes, that means either below or above. Also there is a difference in IQ between races, by denying the problem doesn‚Äôt make it go away. If the IQs are all on par then why the acceptance rates to universities vary drastically between the races. The universities have to put quotas to balance it out, which is wrong, but proves the point. <br>The problem is not the race itself, it is the culture of the people that make success for them harder to achieve than the other races

 There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúfacts you know don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù and ‚ÄúFacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù. This video aims to disprove the first, while not touching universal, a priori truths that are independent of human biases and feelings which you mention. For example, with the photograph and map examples, the fact of the photos existence can be subjectively interpreted, and this would rely on feelings. However, the fact of the photos existence IN AND OF ITSELF, cannot be debated and is necessarily true. There are propositional statements that are of the same kind, which are the ones dark web activists such as Ben Shapiro use. All in all, there are necessary truths that don‚Äôt care about feelings.

 I actually disagree with the whole thing , the argument here is that numbers can be wrong , while what was supposed to be the conclusion is that numbers can‚Äôt be wrong and that how much if those facts go into making your decision (due to emotion) can determine whether you make objective decisions or not , the police sift are example is just a technical glitch that‚Äôs needs to be fixed , that wasn‚Äôt caused by any one‚Äôs bias or emotion , science has a mechanism within itself which is what experimentation is. As for Ben Shapiro ( if he‚Äôs cherry picking facts ) the problem lies in him cherry picking facts not the facts itself. so I‚Äôm the end facts DONT care about your feelings.

 Let me start by saying than Ben Shapiro is little more than a Gish gallopping clown, and I&#39;m not going to defend him. However, there are some fatal flaws in your argumentation.<br><br>Some people misunderstanding how models work and what they do does not mean that somehow models can&#39;t be used responsibly. For example, weather can be forecast extremely well on short time scales with proper initial data. This requires a sound understanding of how the model works, and many decades of model development, but it can be done. Weather forecasting models are not inherently trash just because some guy down the street uses it wrong. Predictive policing models could likely be improved if the distribution of sampling is taken into account (or in a number of other ways). I would even say that not taking it into account is a gross oversight, and I find it hard to believe that it is not already done. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that you will find crime in the exact places where you actually go looking for it. The entire scenario you painted reeks of someone having no clue of how to use the model. Someone else might use it in a proper way, but your sample size of one case doesn&#39;t capture that.<br><br>Some people misunderstanding the scientific method does not mean that it is all just opinion. While having a gut feeling is an important factor in the direction someone&#39;s research takes, this does not mean that all science is just a gut feeling. Science is incredibly slow and works in incredibly small steps specifically because of the care put into the application of the scientific method.<br><br>Further, you drastically underestimate the amount of work that goes into ensuring that scientific progress is based on previous research, sound reasoning, and not riddled with speculation. There is a reason why publications aren&#39;t just accepted as fact, but discussed endlessly, and more and more research is done to clarify the picture. Anyone working in the field will tell you that &quot;a study has shown&quot;, or even &quot;studies have shown&quot;, can be very interesting, but should not be immediately believed without reservations. I recently read a paper that used p-hacking, ffs....<br><br>You found an elaborate way of saying that facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, but what is and what isn&#39;t a fact cannot be determined by using the scientific method. Instead, we can only be really, really sure that something is true, though not absolutely sure, and getting to that point is really hard.<br><br>While &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is sometimes misused as &quot;I interpreted a statistic in specific way, so I&#39;m right and you&#39;re not&quot;, this doesn&#39;t mean that facts secretly do care. It means that Ben Shapiro doesn&#39;t understand science (or math, for that matter).

 THAT was brilliant. Bravo. As Schopenhauer put it echoing Hume, reason is the hard pressed servant of the will. And if we take will in the original Nietzschean sense then it includes instincts drives motivations and the gamut of human emotion which the ancient Greeks referred to as the passions. I&#39;ve always thought that Shapiro discounted emotion and the instinctive intuitive aspects of the psyche while way overemphasizing pure rationality. There are other types of knowledge other than empirical knowledge. Facts and data may be the engine which drives the train but you need passion and will to plot the course and set the destination. Cold hard facts can&#39;t do that. They can tell you how to get there but they can&#39;t choose it in the first instance. We need passion for that. In Critique of Pure Reason Kant writes that there&#39;s no such thing as pure human objectivity. This is because every human being is immersed in a family a social group a community a culture and a society. Those things shape our perception worldview and the way we perceive and process data. They also instantiate in the psyche a litany of biases and assumptions which may or may not be specious. They too shape our perceptions and the way we look at and handle facts. We are not a free floating eye like Emerson described objectively representing the true state of the world. Rather we are more like filtering machines embedded in several different milieux at once. Reason is the hard pressed servant of the will. We choose  love hate create destroy intuit disdain and have spiritual insight and knowledge before we encounter facts the emotional imperative dictates what we do with them.

 From counselling I&#39;ve developed a particularly strong need for people to express what they mean through being as explicit as possible about their feelings. This video frustrates me quite a lot because, as far as I can tell, in my eyes it suffers from a degree of contradiction in that regard.<br><br>If exposing attitudes and &#39;biases&#39; [not a fan of that term, I prefer just saying feelings] is important for understanding the broader world around us more independently of our individual experience, then this video could be an intimate and vulnerable self-expos√© on your attitudes towards ways of thinking such as Ben&#39;s, but it isn&#39;t. Instead you seem to me to continue to use relatively &#39;objective&#39; language such as &#39;but this isn&#39;t true&#39;, &#39;actually&#39;, &#39;well in fact&#39; as opposed to phrases like &#39;but it seems to me&#39;, and I honestly do think that this is a contradiction.<br><br>If I give off the sense that I&#39;m playing a game of &#39;intellectual gotcha&#39; then please understand that I don&#39;t intend for that, this is sincerely just something that I feel I notice. Hearing objective language (or intellectualised feelings) gets to me a little because of what I mentioned earlier and it&#39;s frustrating that others can simultaneously advocate for more concern for feelings whilst disregarding the feelings that have motivated the content they&#39;re producing. To me, there&#39;s a wafer thin wall there separating this apparent contradiction from the vulnerable discourse that I would deeply cherish and it kills me to see that wall remain unbroken. 

 	Replies: ['Zexion theFirst', 'On the note of &quot;[not a fan of that term, I prefer just saying feelings]&quot; I want to say that biases is more than just the feeling. It&#39;s the &quot;why&quot; of the feeling as well. And with it being so easy for biases to be subconscious, it can lead to positions being taken without feeling anything (or, more likely in my experience, misunderstanding our feelings, leading to a sense of frustration that overrides the root cause).<br><br>If I may, I&#39;d like to get &quot;intimate and vulnerable&quot; for a moment to explain what I mean. If you&#39;ve been on facebook at all, I imagine you&#39;ve seen a meme or two that says something along the lines of &quot;I&#39;m glad I learned about parallelograms instead of taxes.&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s [insert year], get rid of [insert class type] and teach kids Financial Fundamentals. [List of what that would include]&quot;<br><br>I see these kinds of posts all the time from my Facebook friends. And the thing is, my school did teach us an massive amount about financial literacy. We learned how to do our taxes. We learned what interest rates are, the different ways they can be calculated, how stocks and bonds work, and a bunch of other stuff.<br><br>In fact, Economics was a required course to graduate at my high school. (In fact, it was a required course to graduate in my state).<br><br>And the thing is, the people I see posting these memes are people I went to school with. They&#39;re people who I grew up with, and got the same education as me. Most of the time they&#39;re people who were literally in the same physical class as me, sitting two or three desks away, saying that they were never taught X, Y, or Z. <br><br>And so, I get really annoyed when I see posts like that, even if they&#39;re from strangers. And my point is, focusing on the annoyance (the feeling) is less useful than focusing on the biases causing it. <br><br>Let&#39;s imagine for a second that you post one of those memes:<br><br>Because of my own experience, I tend to default to assuming that you&#39;re school did teach these things, and the real issue is that you either 1) didn&#39;t pay attention, or 2) a 30 minute lesson that you didn&#39;t care about and happened 10 years ago isn&#39;t very memorable. <br><br>Now, for the sake of time and my own mental energy I&#39;m going to fast forward a bit. <br><br>Basically, I&#39;d have three or four different biases affecting my assumptions of you. And that would make productive conversation impossible. Instead of talking about reforming education standards, I&#39;d just insinuate and insist that you did learn these things and you&#39;re just sharing the post because you&#39;re lazy or forgetful. <br><br>Instead of having a conversation about how the methods teachers use might be conducive to long term retention, I would get defensive because you just hated your teacher for no reason and are taking this as an excuse to bash them needlessly.<br><br>Instead of, instead of, instead of....<br><br>So, that&#39;s why I&#39;d argue that &quot;biases&quot; is more accurate than &quot;feelings&quot;. And more useful. Because by recognizing first that we have biases, we are able to start working through them. And by working through biases, we are able to act in healthy, rational ways. <br><br>Now, to be clear: recognizing feelings is a super hecking important step. It&#39;s the first step to introspection, and you can&#39;t do anything without doing it first.<br><br>On a side note, I&#39;m sorry for the long post. I&#39;m not even sure if this is relevant, interesting, or helpful. Now that I&#39;m at the end of it, I sorta feel like I&#39;m over explaining a nitpick. But sunk cost as kicked in...']

And then he picks which &quot;facts&quot; he can find that support his already-decided worldview and reject the rest, and then argues against the facts of opposing viewpoints using emotional rhetorical tactics to try and make the person he&#39;s debating feel attacked and make it more difficult for them to argue, and then acts like his opposition was the one getting &quot;emotional&quot;, as if expressing facts emotionally somehow changes the fact itself. I wouldn&#39;t call it precisely a rhetorical appeal to emotion, but it&#39;s been a long time since my 200-level rhetoric class so I couldn&#39;t precisely name which argument from pathos this is.

 My take: Science is a tool; a very VERY useful tool to discover objective truths about the universe. However, like many tools, science has its limits, and we must be careful using it to try and define things beyond pure observation, data, repeatable experiment, etc. <br><br>Example: Science helps us discover things like dark matter, which exists and is responsible for many observed phenomena. Then, there&#39;s something like the creation of the universe; science cannot work in this case because there&#39;s no way to test or disprove any theory, including God or even theories rooted in scientific concepts like quantum physics. <br><br>Since we cannot disprove a theory of how the universe came to be, I think at the very least we should be careful of how much scientific concepts we enforce on those types of things. Often times people think that God and science are contradictory to each other, which is not true, they can be harmonious. It&#39;s just when people use religion in a wrong way (just like science) to make claims about concepts like evolution that are wrong, and can be proven wrong through experiment.<br><br>Point being: science has its limits, use it like a tool and use the tool for the problems it&#39;s made for. Any problem beyond science needs different tools to solve, perhaps science could be of some use, but it is not a replacement, nor multi tool that applies to absolutely everything.

 ok, I watched until almost 18 min in where she transitions to how she thinks we should use her &quot;insights&quot;. It was pretty torturous, but I did listen. <br><br>She makes some good points. Absolutely, DATA we get is, in the end, made up of specific facts we choose to input. I can see how the concept of sending more police to an area gets you more arrests in that area, ergo it is seen as a &quot;high crime&quot; area. Humans do have a tendency to decide what facts to go with. Collections of data can, and do get skewed for a lot of reasons. <br><br>That is actually the argument against the so called &quot;wage gap&quot;. Yes, it SEEMS women are being paid less when you only consider actual wages. When you ALSO include that men tend to work more hours and go into higher paying jobs, it looks much differently. There&#39;s also the constant situation where there is outrage because a photograph or video makes it look like a police officer is in the wrong but it is missing contex and/or the perspective is skewed.<br><br>In all, the argument she is giving seems to be more, &quot;We can be wrong about the facts and we pretend we are being objective but both &quot;sides&quot; are picking only the facts they want that agree with them or their &quot;side&quot;&quot;. I agree. She does not, however, deal with the type of facts Ben Shapiro and others like him are actually talking about. The argument is moreso, &quot;absolute truth exists and if you feel one way that doesn&#39;t automatically make it true&quot;.<br><br>If you were born a male, with a penis, with a y chromosome instead of two xx&#39;s, you are a man.

 I am confused... I think what Shapiro is saying when he says &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is that what&#39;s true will remain true regardless of how you feel. And it seems like you would agree with that. The only way to disagree is to say that facts are subject to our feelings--that we somehow dictate truth (which you clearly don&#39;t agree with: cops shouldn&#39;t execute the law based on race, and Shapiro shouldn&#39;t call certain groups stupid. They are wrong, even though they feel like they are right). I guess what I am saying is feel free to call Shapiro a hypocrite, he is one.<br><br>Your video is super difficult to argue against, because either 1) you contradict yourself, or 2) you are arguing something completely different than what you say you&#39;re arguing. You can&#39;t say &quot;Shapiro is wrong: here&#39;s proof&quot; without first agreeing that there are provable facts. You even seemed to notice this yourself at the beginning when you said &quot;facts do, in fact, care about your feelings.&quot; 

 	Replies: ['redseptember', '\u200b@Zexion theFirst Sooooo... I think that what you are saying is right--Zoe is simply pointing out that the things which we hold as objectively true are actually not so--they are subject to our interpretation, our methods of understanding them, and the ways in which we find them. <br><br>But, while it does seem like that&#39;s the heart of the video, that isn&#39;t what is literally stated. Here is a single, very much so cherry-picked quote to back that up. Zoe said near the end of the video, &quot;Facts are dependent on ideology; facts do actually care about your feelings.&quot; If this statement is to be taken literally, then truth is subject to our emotions; objective realities change based off of our emotions. The problem with that is that it stops any conversation from ever happening. If objectivity is subject to my whims, then I am never wrong, so why debate anyone ever? So, she must not actually mean that &quot;acts are dependent on ideology. She must mean that our interpretation of facts is dependent on ideology. <br><br><br>Ultimately, the issue I am taking is a nitpick. I am convinced by Zoe&#39;s argument, but her words are often confusing. <br><br>Also (unrelated to the rest of this), thanks for responding to my comment! You cleared up my confusion with the video, and I look forward to watching the rest of this video series! I really appreciate what you said about logos vs pathos, and how pathos is often what convinces people of things. Helpful stuff!', 'Zexion theFirst', 'So, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll see this but: this is one part of a larger series. All together, the point of the series is that you can not change a person&#39;s mind without Logic, Emotion, and Authority. (logos pathos ethos). <br><br>The point of this video is that you, specifically, are more driven by emotion that you realize. Equally true, every human is driven by emotion moreso than they, or you, are aware. Further, we have a number of thoughts and opinions and conclusions on a breath of subjects across countless fields.<br><br>We are not experts in most of the fields that we hold opinions on. Because of that, we inherently lack all of the facts. We only have access to a subset of facts. And our feelings (biases) determine what facts we accept, and which facts we ignore.<br><br>Going back to the larger series: Facts do not change people&#39;s mind. You, if you are trying to persuade someone, have to get them to care about the facts you are using to support your position. You need Pathos AND Logos. <br><br>As a side note, Authority is also interchangeable with trust. I just took some amount of time and energy to type this out, but if you don&#39;t feel you can trust I&#39;m acting in good faith, then it&#39;ll be incredibly easy for you to ignore/dismiss everything I&#39;ve said. <br><br>The over arching issue is that some people put an over emphasis on Logos, and those people also tend to refuse to recognize that they aren&#39;t more rational, logical, or unemotional that any other human. They have not reached an objective conclusion based on facts and logic. Their emotions led them to a conclusion, and then they declared it&#39;s objective because they could rationalize it.<br><br>Any person can rationalize anything.

 As a perceptual scientist and computational modeler, I 100% agree with every word you&#39;ve said here... except that objective facts exist. Truthfully I have no idea if they exist, and I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t matter. We have no access to objective reality. Every source of information we have comes through our sensory systems, and is heavily processed and filtered by our brains well before it reaches the level of beliefs we hold about the world. More deeply, there&#39;s no sense in which the symbols your brain uses to mean things like &quot;red&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; have the same properties as the theoretical red chair, except /perhaps/ in the predictions they make about other symbols and properties.<br><br>Which, admittedly, is sort of where you start to be able to rebuild something that resembles the concept of &quot;objective facts&quot;, if you squint and tilt your head. If I really put on my hardcore perceptual scientist hat, I don&#39;t think I can ever say that anyone&#39;s beliefs are wrong. But I can say that some belief-sets make better predictors than others, given particular loss-functions on different kinds of prediction error.

 As someone who is studying AI and Data Science, I really appreciate the focus on the issue of data the way this video essay speaks about it! It&#39;s one of the most important things to understand when working with data, which not only people outside of the field, but even some in the field are &quot;blissfully&quot; unaware of. I was fortunate enough to have a prof, who did an econometry study, be so persistent on driving home that fact to every student. Data is a product of and for human interpretation, and it&#39;s important to realise that even data has a bias.<br><br><i>Bias</i> is even a term used to take into account when training models. More clear you cannot make the concept of interpretive data. Computers pretty much now just do what we humans used to calculate by hand. It&#39;s all statistics behind a fancy wall of technobabble to appeal to business inclined people and make it sound more impressive and godlike than it actually should be seen. The computer is a tool that can make, made by humans and their biases, not a prophet that knows the deterministic outcome of the entire universe. All its decisions are stochastic.

 Not to say this was a bad video -it was really good, but with your example of crime, I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s not a good thing to have more police officers in areas with more crime. The more crime stopped, obviously the better. That doesn&#39;t mean that black people are genetically more violent because more black neighborhoods have more crime, it means these neighborhoods needs better infrastructure, schooling and job oppurtunities and also more cops to prevent more people from becoming criminals. Maybe I interpeted it wring, but it seemed like you were suggesting that sending cops in areas with more crime is a bad thing. Even if it&#39;s just smaller crimes like stealing, that&#39;s really important to stop too because it affects the buisness, which perhaps means they need to raise prices to compensate for the lost revenue which makes the people even poorer and is overall extremely bad. I don&#39;t get how that can possibly be described as &quot;vicious.&quot; I agree with your point, but the conclusion and example was really bad in my opinion at least 

 	Replies: ['Matti Mcfc', '@Lady Marigold The point of policing is to stop crime. People commit more crime in some areas than others, that&#39;s why you obviously distribute police officers equitably. Usually in these poorer neighborhoods it&#39;s more gangviolence and stealing in reality. It&#39;s far, far better to take preventative action in these areas than to let them destroy these areas and make their lives even worse. Criminals are systemically racist by that definition. <br>Distributing all police officers equally everywhere should to everyone be a horrible idea. Do you actually believe there should be the same amount of cops in Detroit and New Hampshire?', 'Lady Marigold', 'well no, because there isn&#39;t just crime in those areas. the vicious feedback loop is the fact that since there are policemen there to catch crime, that means that the data keeps pointing there. and because the data keeps pointing there, more policemen go there to see if anything is up, which is usually almost always nothing. but because of biases and because there&#39;s always loiterers and people who might go a mile over the speed limit, and because as we&#39;ve seen, cop are more violent towards black people <del>who are overwhelmingly poorer, and poorer neighborhoods are the ones police go to</del> that causes more &quot;crime&quot; to be caught. policing is good, but what we&#39;re against is overpolicing. a parent who punish&#39;s a child for bad behavior is ok, but a child who overpunish&#39;s a child for &quot;bad&quot; behavior is bad.<br><br>because more &quot;crime&quot; is caught, that means most poc and poc families have &quot;criminal&quot; records which lowers their chances of getting hired for better paying jobs, causing them to be poorer. this is why we call it &quot;systemic racism&quot; because it overwhelmingly affects people of color, and it acts systemically, even if the system itself <b>seems</b> to be unbiased.']

 The quote you provide from the person under the pseudonym &quot;Atticus Goldfinch&quot; has a fatal flaw in the reasoning. It begins by correctly observing that people&#39;s understanding of facts are filtered through feelings and biases... but the conclusion, that this should be accepted, is backwards. Someone who actually cares about facts and truth must push through and counter, wherever they can, the influence of their own biases and feelings, because facts, actual objective facts, don&#39;t care about your feelings; &quot;your&quot;, meaning your own, not just other people&#39;s. There are conservatives like Ben Shapiro who don&#39;t understand this part, and trumpet the statement with the implicit notion that it&#39;s only OTHER people who should have to separate their feelings from factual assessments. But that&#39;s not the reality. In short, your argument reads as: &quot;Since other people, like Ben Shapiro, let feelings influence what they believe to be fact, that means it&#39;s okay for us to do it, too&quot;.

 I love how you categorize Sam Harris as a colleague of Ben Shapiro on the &quot;Dark Web&quot;, and then go on to associate him with climate denialism among other things he absolutely disagrees with.

 So, you start with &quot;I&#39;m just going to look at words and what they mean&quot;... but your thesis statement &quot;facts DO care about your feelings&quot; is easy to analyze, and show to be false by the definitions of the words in play. So I know, going in, that you&#39;re going to attempt a word game of redefining terms and claiming that these alternative definitions are the &quot;real&quot; definitions. Let&#39;s see if my assessment is correct...

 Brilliant video - thank you for making this!  When people talk about being &#39;rational&#39; they usually mean &#39;common sense&#39; but as we all know common sense is only common to a particular community with shared values, norms and goals.<br><br>If you haven&#39;t already read them, would highly recommend Collins &amp; Pinch&#39;s books, &quot;The Golem: What everyone Should Know about Science&quot; and &quot;The Golem at Large: What Everyone Should Know about Technology&quot; - really accessible intro to the sociology of scientific knowledge and the role of trust, bias and other social confoundes in the agreement over scientific results/ truth.<br><br>I also get frustrated with Shapiro&#39;s &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; aphorism as facts are of no use to anyone without feelings about them - feelings or values determine how facts are used to choose an action... social conservatives disagree with progessive ideas around gender and sexuality precisely because they have <b>feelings</b> about tradition and traditional values. Anything else is obfuscation and gets in the way of a debate around the real reason for disagreement. The US plausibly still doesn&#39;t have any kind of social healthcare access because those with extreme wealth have feelings (greed for example) about their wealth and so persuade the electorate that they don&#39;t want what everyone else in the world feel very positive about. These debates always heavily rely on people&#39;s feelings in how they select, interpret and apply facts.<br>Sorry bit of a rant.<br><br>Fabulous - please  make more! :)

 I feel like this was clickbait. I think you agree with Ben Shapiro‚Äôs position on this matter, you‚Äôve just slapped an ACTUAL definition on ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that opens people up to the scientifically important skepticism and scrutiny that allows us to discern ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and ‚Äúfiction‚Äù. For that, I commend you. But stuff like:<br>-evolution<br>-gravity<br>-the 4 laws of thermodynamics<br>These are undeniable facts, a certain subgroup of facts that cannot be, with our collective current understanding of the universe, false under any known circumstances. A Nobel Prize awaits anyone who can adequately show otherwise. On the flip side, atomic theory is actually a disproven phenomenon and a replacement model is uhhhh still being worked on, mostly because quantum physics is kinda weird. The scientific consensus isn‚Äôt always right nor do they always agree on everything, but if you want them to think otherwise you need a butt ton of data accrued through a method that has the minimum possible margin for error and the lowest possible level of bias. Ben Shapiro is incapable of this and Jordon Peterson seems not to have even looked at a research paper in at least a decade as he‚Äôs repeated the exact same data (without any citation I‚Äôm pretty sure ü•¥). I‚Äôve never heard Harris‚Äô voice but I assume it‚Äôs much the same.

 I think the greater issue is the belief that one can apply objectivity or science properly to anything that includes humans.

 when it comes to statistical and scientifical method of finding a fact, they don&#39;t care about your feelings, because it follows a particular set of steps, which are and should be repeatable and verifiable, these steps insure that biasses are not being implimented in any part of the experiment. for an example, lets say a black person wants to do a survey to test for a particular characteristic in the population of florida but that peerson is biassed towards white people and ends up messing up the ratios of their sample space. any other scientist whowil repeat that investiation would call cap on it

 See the thing about Shapiro and his viewpoints on the LGBTQ community is that science DOES support the experiences of the LGBTQ community. Sexuality is fluid and isn&#39;t really in the control of an individual. Gender Identity expresses itself PHYSICALLY and SEPERATELY from sex. In fact, there are 16 genes that have some type of say in gender and sex, and they call on each other like a flow chart. That&#39;s 16 places for something to change genetically, meaning that it&#39;s not X and Y for gender. This is why we have Women with XY genes. Because somewhere down the line of 16 genes that control gender and sex, there&#39;s a  differentiation from what we previously thought was true. <br>Ben Shapiro and these conservative &quot;dark intellectual web&quot; guys don&#39;t accept the science being done on these subjects, or at least haven&#39;t educated themselves on it.

 A more accurate title for this video would have been &#39;SOME Facts Do Care About Your Feelings.&#39; There are some immutable facts (such as 2+2) that are demonstrably true. However, once you get to a certain point, the input becomes so complex that we can&#39;t possibly understand what they mean. In the example of the police force, burglaries went down 23%. Okay...that means LESS crime in that area, right? If there&#39;s less crime there, then obviously the police need to go somewhere else and not patrol the areas where crime has gone down.<br><br>This is why no one person can understand such data. No one person should be allowed to make ANY major decisions because their decisions may (and likely will) include bias. The theory is that if enough people weigh in on the decision, the different biases will cancel each other out. This is imperfect at best but it&#39;s what we have. We have nine justices on the Supreme Court. Trials contain between 6 and 12 jurors. The President has an entire cabinet of advisors. The drawback to this is the fact that many chefs take a long time to make soup and we can&#39;t always take a poll to figure out something.

 Of course, there will be errors while collecting and visualising data. But that dosen&#39;t mean that we can be pretty darn sure of something using statistics if the scientist is collecting a sufficient sample size and all the other things a scientist ought to be doing. In fact, that&#39;s exactly what axioms are. Axioms can&#39;t be proven but they are accepted as true because of the unlikeliness for it to be false. Especially with the fact that these political speakers have been studying political topics for years, it would be expected of them to research from multiple sources rather than just one. I think it&#39;s pretty hypocritical to call someone out for using statistics because it&#39;s subject to human bias when you yourself believe in ideas that are entirely based on feelings with little to no evidence whatsoever.(Not talking about zoe here since idk what she believes in but to the people who bring up this exact argument while believing in feeling based ideas like non-binary gender.)

 Zoe, I love your series on puns, but here I beg to differ. This is not a good time to be making this argument, in the face of Qanon, anti-vaxxers and Trumpian disinformation. The right has illegitimately hijacked the issue of free speech and fitted science to their agenda, and we can&#39;t let them get away with it.  Let&#39;s take Shapiro&#39;s claim that IQ scores show clear differences between races. He&#39;s referring to tests administered to US soldiers in the 1940s, and it&#39;s true. Also true, however, is the &quot;Flynn effect&quot; - people today given IQ tests used back then score about 30 points higher on average. So obviously that can&#39;t be genetic, it has to be environmental or social. Railing at Shapiro because his claims are racist doesn&#39;t get us anywhere, no matter how much we feel in our gut that it&#39;s true. Refuting his claims with facts - well, it won&#39;t persuade them, because they only pay attention to facts they like. But it does persuade those of us who believe in evidence and reason. And objective reality. <br><br>The election was not stolen. Vaccines work. Shapiro is a pretentious git. The first two are facts; the third is my opinion.<br><br>What we are talking about, really, is the social consequences of different belief systems. Hitler&#39;s fictional world was beguiling enough to persuade someone of the stature of Martin Heidegger to follow him. The result was a catastrophe. The Trumpist discourse is similarly beguiling to those who follow it, just as the numerous religious made-up realities are to their believers. Some fictional beliefs are eccentric and nothing more. Others are an existential threat. <br><br>So: facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, but your feelings don&#39;t care about facts either. Keats&#39;s dictum,  &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty,‚Äîthat is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot;, is pretty but dead wrong. There are beautiful lies and ugly truths, and you damn well need to know how to tell the difference.

 While i&#39;m 100% agreed in that we choose how to express/accept what facts we want to believe i also believe that facts don&#39;t care about your feelings<br><br>How? Because yes, facts can change, as how people though earth was flat and was the center of the universe and turned out being false, but the universe didn&#39;t care if people didn&#39;t wanted to not believe that we&#39;re just an insignificant dot on a infinite space ever expanding ever moving or the fact that death is part of us, no matter how you feel about it or if you agreed with it or not, it will come, those are just facts, yet still i think the reason why Ben used this statement was pretty childish, as you said, ignoring that those facts can change or can be wrong (as the way Pluto was though to be a dwarf planet and was neglected to be studied till a couple of years and then they said it was a planet again) is an excuse to give the image that one is right and everyone else is wrong which is a pretty arrogant assumption, but what i&#39;m trying to say is that, it doesn&#39;t matter if a politician, a leader of an ideology, a rebel, a doctor or whatever chooses to slightly change the truth in order to make it more bearable, the fact DOESN&#39;T change, we decide to change it for our own interests as the way people say when we die we go to heaven, but it&#39;s most likely that we just disappear, as of we&#39;re dreaming, the fact that we die doesn&#39;t change and until we find a way to be immortal it&#39;ll never change, but we decide to think there&#39;s something else, i think those are two separated things that yet still need to coexist in order to favor something greater, say a community, a town, a city, a continent, the whole world and that doesn&#39;t mean facts can&#39;t be argued or denied, but i do believe they&#39;re independent on what we think or feel, we just choose what use we&#39;ll give them and how we&#39;re gonna use them, but that&#39;s just my humble opinion on this far greater topic

 Hahahahahaha.  This is the perfect example of a person who is literate but totally innumerate and illogical.  The point of the scientific method is to trend towards the elimination of emotive bias in a manner which ultimately gets at the objective nature of things.  So yeah, maybe a person might be wrong based on bias, although, most scientists are keenly aware of their biases and are constantly checking to correct them.  Even if they miss a bias, another person is hopefully going to catch them.  There are proofs, rules of data, and a hierarchical value of evidence.  We can get closer to truth, no one is claiming to have it 100% like spock, but the fact that science has progressed is evidence that bias can be overcome.  What I see here is a person who doesn&#39;t have an awesome handle on the scientific method, knows that her methodology is flawed, and exports her insecurity in her worldview to the broader community.  Why don&#39;t you leave the data to the statisticians, and get back to your abstract interpretation of the biases systemically inherent in feminist english lit, cupcake.

 Very nice video! I quite enjoy discussions about how to reason about &quot;facts&quot; and data, especially in relation to consciousness and making decisions and this was straight up my alley. :) <br><br>From my perspective/view:<br>You can never separate the self from the data/observations you make. &quot;True objectiveness&quot; would be nice to use from time to time but one has to realise that even if you are &quot;truly objective&quot; with respect to data you could never do anything with it because no data gives any indication for any action. <br><br>To get suggestions (or action plans) for actions from data you need to have a preferred state of the world and this will allow you to make suggestions from data. This preferred world is always subjective. (Even something as simple as the objective fact &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; does not imply &quot;I should eat&quot; without having the preferred state &quot;I should not be hungry&quot;, unless two people share the same preferred state it is highly unlikely for two people to propose the same actions from a given data set,  no matter how &quot;objectively&quot; the data is collected.<br><br>And then, of course, you have the fact that the way we interact with the world is that the brain makes predictions on the future from its internal models (build from experience) and hence if two people have had different experiences they may actually experience different aspects of reality.<br><br>For anyone interested in reading about different biases that exist and how to be aware of them I can recommend &quot;Rationality: From AI to Zombies&quot; by Eliezer Yudkowsky. (Which ironically is used a bit by those who claim to be objective without preregistering their biases, but a lot of the essays are quite good and relevant.)

 in my opinion, our feelings and emotions are an integral part of every issue we face, because emotions are an inherent and uncontrollable human trait. ignoring that in regards to issues related to our own humanity is just foolish in my opinion. feelings should not be disregarded; instead, they should be listened to and analyzed, and the choice as to whether or not they are important should be made afterwards. it&#39;s not healthy to go by only the heart or only the mind. what&#39;s healthy to me is to know which is best in each individual situation.

 Hi, everyone!<br><br>So, I do admire people such as mr. Peterson and Ben Shapiro, but the things told in this video are quite right! But not quite all...<br><br>First - perception. We do alter facts depending on our views, but it doesn&#39;t mean that fact is subjectively constructed. Smart people out there endeavoured hard to develop a way to obtain, process and deliver information as accurately and &quot;objectfully&quot; as possible.<br>If you read a sheet on the basics of physical mechanics you are unlikely to perceive the thing depending on your feelings or wishes. Because it is written in a certain language I mentioned earlier.<br>But there is a much bigger problem to objectivism, which is politically driven researches, the which I&#39;ve not found mentioned.<br>Yet, it doesn&#39;t mean that all researches are driven by views and feelings. We don&#39;t know the one making the observation, but sometimes people just want to know the truth. They want to understand things, so sometimes they just sit and observe, and it is as simple as that!<br><br>And yeah... If police sees that a poor block is struggling through crime more than any, it doesn&#39;t mean every bit of force will go to this block, neglecting anything else. And is if there really is more crime, why not spend more time and effort trying to put it out? The author of the essay stated that the fact of poor blocks having more crime makes a bad impression of them in whole. Maybe it does, but is it unjust? And it does for a normal citizens, not for structures that just use the AI tool to know that they are needed greatly there. And if a police officer makes an assumption that if a beggar district has crime, then everyone living there must be performed violence to and controlled aggressively, than it is mandatory to deprive such a person of his power. So this argument tells us of problems of society and governmental unrighteousness, but not the wrong of information.<br><br>But I do love the argument she makes that Ben himself could be biased to certain point, skipping over the evidence contradicting his views, or forming it in his own preferred way. Therefore we must always have will to check the info, ask it. It is called critical thinking and it, too, is an important part of the rationalism.<br><br>And by the way, the point that the scientists must be unfeeling in order to write unfeeling essays is not too real to me. Humans can be feeling in many things: relationships, the betterment of both self and others, art, et cetera. But when a scientist, after all previously mentioned, sits down before his desk, his straight responsibility and humanly duty is to be as objective and unbiased as possible. He is not a robot. He might pretend to be a robot to make his work unstained and comprehend more.

 I don‚Äôt understand her argument with the mathematical model as something biased and unfair. The model itself is unbiased; it‚Äôs simply showing the rate of crime, as humans define it, in certain areas. The problem comes with how the police interpret the data. They see it as showing how there needs to be more policing in the area. However, looking at the same data, one can conclude that in order to stop crime, there should be more investment into poorer neighborhoods to reduce the incentives to commit crime. The input data isn‚Äôt really bad, it‚Äôs just the solution to the problem of crime that isn‚Äôt effective.

 i love the video, but i don&#39;t think i can agree. It seems you do a better job at pointing out that we, as humans, don&#39;t follow actual facts, than that the facts don&#39;t care. I feel you were arguing the point more towards &quot;Feelings care about facts&quot; than &quot;facts care about feelings&quot;. Most of your points had the claim that the facts are there, but we choose which ones to listen to. The bigger picture, is that there is one big truth, made up of the little ones, for example, if you say that 12 + 14 = 26, that is a big truth. To come to that conclusion, you must also accept the fact that 6 + 6 = 12, and that 7 + 7 = 14, but also that 3 + 3 = 6, and 3 + 4 = 7, and so on. If you disagree that 6 + 6 = 12, then the whole equation falls apart, and you get a new answer. To put this into a more practical answer, John comes to the correct conclusion that a 24 pack of soda is worth 11.50 USD, because the carbonation costs 2.50, the water a dollar, the syrup 5.00, and the packaging 1.50, and the remaining 1.50 is for the profit of the creator. Now, for this example, the total price of the sodas is the big truth that the individual pricing, the small truths, combine to make. Now, if someone else, Jack, were to make the conclusion that the price of syrup doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the final pricing, then the final solution that Jack comes up with will be different than John&#39;s even though John is right. This isn&#39;t a case of the &quot;facts care about your feelings&quot; case, this aligns with your case that we as humans come to our &quot;factual&quot; conclusions through the bias and manipulation of what we choose to believe, but the fact is that we aren&#39;t listening to facts, but false truths presented with the combination of chosen facts. I do believe you have a very good case, followed with good supporting facts, but i think the thesis has a misleading name, although i understand why it was chosen<br><br>While i don&#39;t agree with Shapiro, i do agree with the &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; statement on its own.

My love goes out to you, but the world simply doesn&#39;t work like that, and likely won&#39;t for a long time, probably not within our lives.<br><br>To the BLM who blame the government for you mistreatment, don&#39;t, all the laws have been put in place that can be to help you, and it&#39;s not their fault anymore. the harsh truth here is that it&#39;s not the government fighting you, it&#39;s the people themselves. business owners and individual cops, people on the streets and on the internet. Racism is everywhere, and it&#39;s not controllable. The closest we can get is to contain them, and that only serves a new injustice and perpetuates the cycle. <br><br>The best thing we can do is to forgive the haters and to accept that change won&#39;t happen soon, no matter how much that truth hurts. I won&#39;t say we shouldn&#39;t fight against it, we should, but we should fight it within our own communities. Show the haters that there isn&#39;t anything to hate, and while they may not change, at least you aren&#39;t playing into their ideas of you. Taking on the entirety of the US is fruitless and fuels a bigger problem, one that creates hatred on both sides, and continues to create extremists on both sides, which makes the fight pointless

 I know this is late but during black history month i spoke in front of &gt;70 college professors about what it&#39;s like being a black college student in our present time following the events of 2020, the murder of George Floyd, the ascension of Black Lives Matters into worldwide recognition all while living through a global pandemic. I spent a good portion talking about the importance of the hard sciences such as chemistry, physics, and mathematics to recognize that they are not safeguarded by a bubble of objectivity cloistering them within the vacuum of abstraction. To understand in each instance where the subject intersects with humanity- from discovery, to research, exploration, and eventual societal implementation- there is a possibility for the sciences to be corrupted by human fallibility; making it all the more important for professors to keep a socially conscious mindset when teaching these subjects. Imagine my surprise when 7 months later I stumble across this video talking about the same points in a far more articulate manner. I loved every second of this video and you have given me not just new resources to explore but further insight into something until 25 minutes ago I had no idea mattered to other people.

 The premise of this video is wrong. Ben has shown time and time again that he doesn&#39;t care about facts, if they don&#39;t fit his worldview. Facts don&#39;t care about Ben&#39;s feelings. So someone who is &quot;obsessed with facts&quot; would disagree with Ben. <br>I&#39;m not sure if you really don&#39;t have a postmodernist approach to science as you said in the beginning of the video. Do you believe that the scientific method in itself isn&#39;t objective or do you just think that individual scientists and studies aren&#39;t objective? Do you believe that there is no such thing as a &quot;fact&quot; or do you just believe that often what is considered as fact is often in reality not a fact?

 I am not able to understand you are trying to defy logic by logic. It is itself a paradox. When you gave the example of the house not being on google it does not mean that facts do care about your feeling. It just means your facts are wrong and biased. This is why if you have read a good statistic report it always consider bias. Next, you gave the example of policing, well it is much important to police poor (wish police comes in my area it will be much safer at night))neighbourhoods. Now it can be argued that black people are not comfortable but that goes to policing policy but not statistics. Funny, your video works on statistics.

 I think the wording used to counter ben is a bit off.<br>It&#39;s far more accurate to say &quot;Facts may not care about your feelings, but humans should&quot; because the facts don&#39;t change, but it&#39;s fairly simple for someone to forego the understanding that someone was born with a penis, and call that person a &quot;she&quot; because the HUMAN BEING cares about the others feelings. The fact doesn&#39;t change, but for the sake of someone&#39;s happiness, and compassion, we do something different.<br><br>Like... you can&#39;t conduct electricity through wood better than you could a conductive metal. that&#39;s a fact. it won&#39;t change just because you want to conduct electricity through wood, therefore it doesn&#39;t care about your feelings.<br><br>Humans aren&#39;t inanimate objects though, nor are we primal animals with minimal sentience, nor are we uncompassionate assholes.<br><br>Really my point is just &quot;your title is obviously going to attract people who enjoy precision and effectively describing something, as well as assholes who don&#39;t agree with you&quot;, and it leaves people like me to be lumped in WITH those people, when I disagree with their standpoint.<br>Unfortunately this could easily lead to someone considering me transphobic/homophobic/ect. because I disagreed with how you worded your point, not the point in it&#39;s entirety.

 This sounds like rationality vs feelings. Now I will say I do NOT support Ben perception on it and I do not support the feeling aspect either. Both lack accountability for their perception and critical thinking. Example: I read a survey on how male nurses make 5000 more annually when I looked into the survey I found a lack of who is in what field, what position are they in like of their a supervisor or not and even the hours were not taken into account. Now for the feelings I do believe what your feeling is right and is validated because you are where your at but it‚Äôs YOU. Example: Men blame women for the dating scene okay well are you working on you are you taking into account for how you treat the opposite sex and it‚Äôs the same with women. And the fact your saying that you can‚Äôt reach true neutrality I hope your not saying that you can reach common ground. Because fact is where I work man or woman black or white I‚Äôm going to treat you like a person and a adult. People clamoring to raise awareness well that‚Äôs great but people need to move past it and treat a person like a person. Society and media reeks of narcissism and it seems like critical thinking has gone out the window. Fact is you can control what happens to you as much as people try to because life happens but you can control how you handle it. Feelings are reliable because it‚Äôs where your at but what people do with the feeling isn‚Äôt always. People get angry over one thing just to realize that it‚Äôs from a deep seeded issue or lie or trauma. It‚Äôs fine having differences of opinions and still work side by side but from what I‚Äôve seen on social media America isn‚Äôt there due to a lack of maturity. Regardless I‚Äôm going to treat people like people and as adults (if they are one) regardless of gender or skin color.

 But, that doesn&#39;t say that facts care about our feelings. It only says that we as people insert our own interpretations in the conclusions. And saying that science is the same as facts is a mistake, because it would mean that by correcting flawed theories, like the gravity theory that newton made, we would be changing the facts, which is not the case. Science tries to explain the facts, but if they make a mistake, they aren&#39;t rewriting the laws of physics or anything like that, just they are misunderstanding them. As I see it, facts don&#39;t care about our feelings, but in the interpretation, we add things that aren&#39;t true, making our theories flawed and biased. There&#39;s a difference between facts and information. Facts are absolute, they don&#39;t change to our whims, if we aren&#39;t able to see them because of our own biases, that a problem of us as humans, not of the facts. That&#39;s exactly why models are so important, because they are a set of rules that everyone must follow in order to get to the same place (trying to reduce the bias). Also, about what you said about the scientific method, that judgement of the facts is a theory, different from the facts, if it is true, it becomes a valid theory,, because it explains what is happening, if not, then they are not a fact, but a failed theory. For example, if I&#39;m studying a disease that cows are suffering, and I reach the conclusion, that since all cows had been drinking water, the water is what is causing them to get ill, and it&#39;s not, my theory was never a fact, but an interpretation of other facts that was incomplete or biased, and lead me to a bad conclusion. But if I was right, then my theory describes the facts perfectly.

 You start out by, what I would consider, over-emphasizing your characterization of Shapiro based on others charactizations of Shapiro. This is not only meaningless because your opinion of who or what Shapiro is has no relevancy to your point but also because it serves no practical purpose at all. It provides us with no useful information in the context of the discussion. It very much appears that you simply sought to characterize him to inform your audience on how to feel about him when presented with the remainder of the information and that is not only intellectually dishonest but it‚Äôs directly subversive.<br><br>You then proceed to frame the remainder of the discussion around the characterization of the remainder of what you refer to as the ‚ÄúIntellectual Dark Web‚Äù which is equally irrelevant. Your main discussion here is about how bias influences data production, these characterizations of introductions to various individuals truly serves only to frame the position of ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù in the minds of your audience so if your goal was to assert that allowing your biases to inform your world view is a bad thing I‚Äôd like to point out that not only have you done nothing but that in this video but you‚Äôve gone so far as to attempt to ensure your audience does as well.<br><br>Then you go on to prescribe world views to these individuals in ways that approach exaggeration going so far as to lay out their intentions, aspirations, and self-images for them. <br><br>Over five minutes of your video, twenty percent of it‚Äôs total length, and likely the only portion of your video the majority of viewers will see statistically speaking has been spent not only failing to speak about your titles point directly but specifically on characterizing and in cases mischaracterizing individuals in the context of this widely held world view. So when you assert the intention of this video is not to ‚Äúdunk on‚Äù members of the ‚ÄúIntellectual Dark Web‚Äù as you put it I hope you will understand when I have sincere doubts about your intentions and honesty. <br><br>You then spend the next few minutes engaged in what I can only describe as a demonstration of what appears to be either an incredible lack of understanding of what the word fact actually means (which I doubt given your oratory ability and background) or an intentional misrepresentation of what the word fact means. I‚Äôm not sure what Shapiro means when he uses the word fact and I don‚Äôt really care. Fact has a definition. Information that has been proven to be true and is not the result of interpretation. This is the reason we say the Earth being round is a fact, but the central core being made of molten metals is a theory. We effectively ‚Äúknow‚Äù both to be true but we have actually tested one of those sets of information. We have demonstrated, beyond interpretation, that the Earth is ‚Äúin fact‚Äù round. This has been objectively proven to the be case. The same is true of Evolution. Evolution is referred to as theory not because we aren‚Äôt certain it is true, after all we can reproduce evolutionary change in a lab environment. Rather we refer to it as theory when speaking of how things came to be as they are now because we can not go back in time and verify. If we could we would not refer to it as theory. The idea that evolution can happen is a scientific fact, the idea that evolution is how humans came to be is a theory. Definition is vitally important when speaking about a subject and you repeatedly conflated Ben Shapiro‚Äôs interpretations of data with ‚Äúfacts‚Äù. Just because he calls them facts does not make it automatically intellectually responsible for you to refer to them that way as well. <br><br>Small caveat. I do not like that you quoted an entirely fictional character without making it apparent that you had done so. I‚Äôm not sure it matters, the logic is sound but it‚Äôs a small point of contention I have with what I feel is an already dishonest video.<br><br>Larger caveat: There are objective differences in IQ between the sexes. There are not objective differences in IQ score between the sexes. If you had done your research properly you would see in fact that all widely accepted IQ testing methodologies are constructed to ensure the underlying differences between men and women do not produce a difference in score. This admits there are differences that would offset the scores and that these differences must be accounted for to produce a statistically smooth result. Whether or not this is inherently biological is up for debate but it is a fact of reality regardless. This fact is meaningless and allowing it to inform any kind of decision making is asinine but pretending it does not exist is equally asinine. It is likely that the problem lies in our ability to, in a single standardized fashion, test the capacities of both men and women equally. This is why the tests are designed to eliminate this variance. It is not useful data. It represents only that men and women tend to respond to questions differently and does not accurately reflect a difference in ability to understand or comprehend the question being asked. More to the point you have over-represented the amount of peer-reviewed study that actually produces evidence that this is not the case. In fact there are very few studies that claim this is not the case. The majority of the peer-reviewed work on the subject call into contention whether or not this phenomena is a biological phenomena, not whether or not it exists. There are claims that these differences lessen or are eliminated in countries that ‚Äúscore higher‚Äù in areas of ‚Äúgender equality‚Äù and having read many of these papers my self it is concerning that these papers focus mainly on countries that do not have or support standardized methods of IQ testing so of course these differences are not reported by these countries. The ‚Äúbulk‚Äù of the work being done here asserts that the differences that do exist are likely sociological though little in the way of actual evidence has been produced to that end (understandably given how hard it is to produce evidence of sociological influence in any capacity). Personally I agree with these studies, this phenomena is likely sociological in my opinion but the phenomena does exist and very few people are outright denying it. <br><br>Let‚Äôs get to the meat of the problem with your entire video though. Your example. Model driven policing. <br><br>You actually admit the problem with your statement and then immediately disregard it. The question the model is designed to answer is ‚ÄúWhere does the most crime occur?‚Äù. You then procede to admit, directly, that ‚Äúmost crimes occur‚Äù in poor areas. You label the bulk of these crimes as ‚Äúnuissance‚Äù crimes and deem them to be not worth considering. This is fine, but it‚Äôs also irrelevant. The model isn‚Äôt design to tell police what crimes are worth pursuing. It‚Äôs designed to answer the question ‚ÄúWhere do most crimes occur‚Äù and taking just the information you‚Äôve provided the model is doing it‚Äôs job correctly and is being provided with perfectly relevant data. Your assertion that the outcome is undesirable is an opinion of yours. If the goal of police is to ‚Äúprevent the most crime‚Äù and the model produces data of where ‚Äúthe most crime‚Äù occurs and they use it to effectively prevent the largest number of crimes then the model and the policing is being done correctly as far as the opinion of law enforcement is concerned. You might disagree with the methodologies outcome but it does not make the methodology bad. The methodology is sound and is producing the desired effect. You not liking the effect is not relevant. This is what I believe Shapiro means when he says facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings. The data doesn‚Äôt care what crimes you think are worth paying attention to. That‚Äôs not what it was asked to consider. The fact is the majority of crimes occur in poor neighborhoods. Assuming the information you‚Äôve provided is correct, then this is a fact. As stated previously if the goal of the police is to reduce the overall number of crimes being committed then this strategy is the most effective way to achieve that goal. You clearly believe that shouldn‚Äôt be the goal but again.. that is irrelevant. <br><br>To be clear, and fair. I can not stand Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and many others associated with the Intellectual Dark Web. I find many of them to be just as biased and intellectually irresponsible as many of the people they rail against. Dave Rubin and Joe Rogan for instance both share the same fault for me. They produce little more than insulated echo chambers of unoriginal thought. They fail, repeatedly, to challenge their own opinions or those of their guests. Dave Rubin is little more than an ineffectual intermediary in discussions between other individuals simply keeping them on track which is fine if not a bit wasteful given his intellect but Joe Rogan is a far greater offender going so far as to launch into full blown hypocrisy when his own views are challenged. <br><br>I‚Äôm not at all concerned about defending anyone, or tearing down anyone else. The fact is your discussion video is rife with intellectual dishonesty, inaccurate conflation of definitions and opinions, meaningless personal opinion, and an abject failure to recognize that you are using the very same bias to attempt to combat the bias you are asserting exists in others. <br><br>I genuinely feel like this was a waste of your time, and ours.

 theres no way to objectively say why something is bad, even something as bad as murder. why is murder bad? well because it hurts someone, and takes away their life. why is it bad to hurt people? well, its just bad. it feels like a universal truth that hurting someone for the sake of hurting them is bad, but thats just a feeling. theres no factual basis behind that, because its completely based on feelings. every law, no matter how good it is, is 100% based on feelings. why should gay marriage be legal? well, equality is good and gay people deserve just as many rights as everyone else, but you can argue the why behind that because its completely based on how you feel. laws cant be made on facts or feelings, because both are obviously at the whim of bias, so what can we do? well, we can democratically decide on what helps the most people, what brings the most freedom. by making murder illegal, we grant people the freedom to live their life without being killed, which is pretty damn freeing

 I feel like this comment section is the most honest I&#39;ve seen. Everybody is saying both political sides are pretty much evil. Making me realize the toxic spiral we have gotten ourselves into.<br><br>People saying leftist ideologies have started doing some bad stuff even through it&#39;s original good intent. And conservatives being called the same things they always has...<br><br>It&#39;s become very reactionary on both sides. And I hate to think the majority of people are doing bad things. But unintentionally that has always been the case(unless you are racist, at this point it&#39;s very intentional).<br><br>At this point I&#39;m just sad. We haven&#39;t been stopping global warming, we haven&#39;t ended the pandemic in America, we haven&#39;t completely stopped racism, or sexism, people still think autistic people are stupid. We haven&#39;t taken meaningful steps for any of this! We are all just here yelling at each other. And it&#39;s not going to stop. It&#39;s never going to stop. Not until some of us shut up and swallow our pride. But none of you would ever dream about doing that for your own beliefs.<br><br>Just like how I could never accept that I am dumber then a man. Or my purpose is to get pregnant. Or that black people are inherently violent. Ugh. Some of you really be thinking that.

 By this logic, we should really make a really close inspection to most if not every single argument made by antifa, black lives matter, LGBT and feminism since most of their data is taken in a pretty bias way and presented in an even more biased way.<br>And it&#39;s pretty frustrating because they critic these people for using objective data to ignore feelings, but then they ignore the feeling of everyone but themselves.<br>Examples as the wage gap or saying women are the only (or most) victims of abuse, which isn&#39;t true by they collect data in a way to say that, and also say it in a way to ignore men issues and even victim balmer them.

 I would say it a very bad example to talk about policing poor areas and framing that action as something negative to refer to it as &quot;criminalizing of the poor&quot;,I lived in a poor neighborhood for quite a few yearsn... and not having any police around i would say that, having the police around and prevent crime from happening in the places that is needed is a success, i really get the point she is trying to make but having lived in a sinimar situation to what she refers and the police actually just used to patrol in the richer neighborhoods, i really don&#39;t see how is that bad output of data... The overall subject it actually makes a lot of sense and you can see the manipulation of data in anal√≠tic programs that tend to be harsher with segments of the population that tend to have higher porcentaje of crimes...

Our results suggest far smaller heritabilities: broad-sense heritability, which measures the total effect of genes on IQ, is perhaps 48%; narrow-sense heritability, the relevant quantity for evolutionary arguments because it measures the additive effects of genes, is about 34%.

 The Crime model is a perfect example. The Model is doing it&#39;s job perfectly. It is spitting out the outcomes of current policies without any hypothesis or solution on what to do with the cause of those outcomes are. That is only useful for dealing with the outcomes, but it is useless in dealing with the cause because it doesnt model the cause. Models need to be used for what they are designed for nothing more and nothing less. To use these Models to create broader policies that go beyond the scope of the Model or to imply more meaning to these models then they are designed to have is where the issues really lie and where peoples feeling often get in the way because that is exactly what they do. Using the Models to justify actions and reactions is bad because Models do not prescribe actions, they simply tell you outcomes. If you are looking at the crime rates and saying &quot;just send more police there&quot; you are looking at the model and prescribing an action to it that it does not give. It only gave you the outcome of current policies, it did not in anyway make a prescription for that outcome you did.

 Well yeah, we seek facts cause we have the feeling of &quot;this is not right&quot; many facts have been created because the person itself didnt like the facts of the other person, and facts are created to create a feeling of security in one part and a feeling of disconfort in other part, so after all, we can trust facts? Yeah, but only facts that can be prove by many people not only by one, or facts made by a super computer.

 I see a weakness in your argument. You gave an in depth analysis how models for generating data are bias, yes that is the case and I believe it shouldn&#39;t be used in policing and as the center peace for a social structure, but if you use a model for a evidence to suggest something then it is valid, because if the model is bias, there is peer review. Just as the arguments for bias scientists and bias papers, PEER REVIEW PEOPLE. Even if we agree that we won&#39;t use any mathematical model, we can still get evidence objectively with other scientific methods like using control groups, doing large scale observations, etc. and then interpret the results in a paper. Then the whole community has the ability to criticize the paper and there you get an objective enough evidence for your argument that isn&#39;t bias( while you can always get evidence from a bad paper, the moment you get as viral as let&#39;s say Ben Shapiro, it is unreasonable to think that people won&#39;t actually look up the evidence he is presenting and call him out if he is using papers without much peer review or paper that are largely criticized by peers). I myself am not affiliated in either the left or right and like to just try and be as neutral as possible, but my point is. If there is even one method trough you can get objective evidence, that has stood the tests of the scientific community, then the argument for arguments don&#39;t care about your feelings still stays, although I agree that you shouldn&#39;t use the statement as a cop out or a trump card to invalidate the arguments based on a principle

 One bias I think many of us have (I sure have and fight with) is the ideal of male rationality. The whole idealism of objective thought being a very masculine trait. <br>Being raised in the Christian Church this was pushed as objective truth (in a house of faith) and female is the un-rational, emotional driven. <br>It‚Äôs so tied to how these conversations go or how one arguing may perceive themselves above another. <br>The most realistic objectivity is that humans are emotionally driven even in debates of truths or facts. Facts are an expression of human emotions. Yes I am getting very wishy washy but people don‚Äôt just stumble upon facts they search them out. They devoted careers to them.   A lot of low level rational arguments I see go on with gender. Who more rational who is more emotional.  And gods I am tired of them being used against others. <br><br>I really did enjoy this video.

 First time viewer, astonished by the incoherence. You leap from enlightenment thinkers to Shapiro, mask slips there already, then you cite actual facts like climate change and juxtapose them with Shapiro, but there is no clarity here, and before you resolve any of this, you are discussing objectivity. <br><br>We are in the familiar genre of post-colonial science-bashing quickly, the emphasis on scientists being humans with cognitive biases. Shapiro is placed with enlightenment thinkers, because they are old white men and their colonial-oppresive ways. As usual. Rather than telling Shapiro off, that he‚Äôs lying, and that the political right is not usually aligned with evidence (most of climate change denial comes from the right, for instance), the vlogger here prefers to undercut evidence itself in two ways: first propagating Shapiro‚Äôs delusional fantasy that he got the facts on his side, then by undermining the establishment of knowledge.<br><br>It gets worse. After establishing that the collection of evidence is guided by emotion, there are leaps from science and experts to ordinary people. Now the argument is that experts maybe (?) are not guided as much by feelings, but you ‚Äî an individual ‚Äî is. That‚Äôs a total clich√© of postmodernism, even though it allegedly doesn‚Äôt exist. The argument against this type of reasoning is printed in the aptly titled ‚ÄúFashionable Nonsense‚Äù and says that postmodernism (so-called in 1995) is trivially true in one reading, but utter nonsense in another.<br><br>So it‚Äôs trivially true that people have feelings, and that feelings influence their behaviours, including gathering and presenting of facts. It‚Äôs utter nonsense that this has significant influence on science, or the facts themselves. We know for decades that Climate Change is real, and the data was showing a change long ago. The facts don‚Äôt change because right wing denialism (their feelings, or profit motives) don‚Äôt like those facts. The thesis remains false in the other interpretation, too, you can only have feelings on something by first acknowledging on some level what that is, you have negative feelings about, to subsequently ignore, lawyer-away or suppress those facts. No, the facts don‚Äôt care about feelings. People prefer some facts more than others.<br><br>That hits a final aspect of the postmodernist clich√©, namely a profound confusion of map with the territory. The territory is as it is. We can try to understand it, but that always requires making a map of that territory, or several actually, and improve them. That‚Äôs all cluttered up, mixed in the confused minds of a postmodernist, to whom ‚Äúall is text‚Äù which all is subject to social forces (or emotion). <br><br>In sum, a terrible, harmful video, but in spirit of current US cultural exports ‚Äî virtue signalling wokeness where ego-hurt Americans try to moral grandstand on an international stage, whilst their country is the leading polluter per person (almost 2:1) and their government, including the Democrats, lunge from war to war and into a climate catastrophic abyss.

 Summary: Humans filter stuff based on numerous biases, therefore all &quot;facts&quot; are filtered/modified as we digest them, therefore we cannot know &quot;facts&quot; . And the less knowledge you have in a given field, the more facts will be distorted as they are digested. Vaguely Platonic, but not very well thought out. Yes, no single person has a complete and unbiased grasp of anything, but the scientific method has been developed to make allowances for this. That is why we have double-blind testing. it&#39;s why we have peer-reviewed publications, and why any published research must be reproducible. AND EVEN THEN, no scientist would claim anything as a &quot;Fact&quot; in the sense of an &quot;eternal truth&quot; .. each &quot;Fact&quot; of science is actually the CURRENT CONSENSUS VIEW that is subject to change as more information becomes available and theories are refined. Even something as simple as &quot;1+1=2&quot; is subject to careful qualification. So what makes science different from opinion? Because in science, THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM. We can QUANTIFY the certainty. And this is very different from, and nothing to with, any political correctness, ideology, religion or faith. The presenter clearly fails to grasp this, and in &quot;fact&quot; her own thesis exposes this.

 So basically, &quot;Facts&quot; is a set of data gathered by people, who can be biased, and may have feelings influence it.<br><br>However, I do feel that these same data sets can be put under scrutiny over and over again, to get it closer to a more objective state.<br><br>Perhaps a model that has been put through multiple angles of scrutiny and achieve &quot;no feelings&quot; should be defined as &quot;facts&quot;.

 I‚Äôm completely with you on the idea that human bias plays a role in statistics, and that is a key point to be made against all sides of the political spectrum. However, when it comes to your example of policing, you seem to be making the unrealistic assumption that crimes don‚Äôt get reported. Regardless of where the police are patrolling on a day to day basis, if a murder is reported, the police are still going to investigate it no matter where the crime took place, and it will still contribute the data about the location and frequency of crimes. That data says that more murders happen in poorer areas. The reasons for that are up for debate, but ultimately that does seem to be a pretty undisputed fact. You can‚Äôt pretend that those statistics are false, because that would be to assume that when murders happen in rich areas, hardly anybody reports them, which would be ridiculous. Therefore, it makes sense to have police patrol more in poorer areas, because that acts as a deterrent to crime, and as a result there is likely fewer crimes committed in those areas than there would be otherwise.

 While I believe Shapiro is an absolute lunatic, I can&#39;t help to agree with him on this. <br><br>This video doesn&#39;t disprove that facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, this video just proves that people are  incapable of identifying what actual facts are. <br><br>Bad math and data input will result in incorrect information that could be mislabeled as facts by some depending on their agenda, but in an unbiased vacuum universal truths exist that are  completely oblivious and uncaring of human feelings. For example if a person is terrified and/or offended about the cold uncaring vastness of the known universe and chooses not to believe in it, that changes nothing, the universe is still cold vast and uncaring.<br><br>People care about facts, facts don&#39;t care about you, they are absolute.

 When dealing with predictive policing, I was working on a similar program (for a game) last week. What I did to get better results was to scale the &quot;crimes&quot; based on type and severity. The result was that formerly &quot;high-crime&quot; areas became much more moderate and formerly &quot;low-crime&quot; areas, like parks, lit up. How the programmer uses the input also greatly affects the output.

 i mean... I actually AGREE that facts don&#39;t care about feelings... I mean, the world is round no matter how much you may wish or feel it isn&#39;t.  it&#39;s just that my strong suspicion is that many of those who toot this as a battecry are just as guilty of ignoring facts in preference for their feelings as anyone that they accuse.  The battle AGAINST &#39;wokeness&#39; is very much pushed from a platform of FEELING marginalized  (or even WISHING they were).  The base human instinct to feel marginalized is pretty much identical between those who are factually marginalized... and those who aren&#39;t REALLY marginalized at all.  The underlying &#39;feeling&#39; is identical, the FACTS don&#39;t delineate between them... the facts are simply the facts.<br><br>Of course how we choose to PRESENT the facts, can muddy the waters... but I don&#39;t consider the perception of a fact to be &#39;the fact&#39; itself.  Afterall, whether one decides that the world being round is perfectly acceptable vs those who find the presentation of the world being round is somehow a sacrilege and means that god has abandoned us for whatever nutty reason they&#39;ve devised in their own minds.... doesn&#39;t change the underlying reality.   I mean we can all probably agree that Ben Shapiro has a lot of... &#39;strong&#39; opinions for a man utilizing such a battlecry from what I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>Perhaps a better way to present the idea would be &quot;Reality does not care about feelings.&quot;........................ but that it still has to be interpreted through our ape brains programmed to have feelings.

 I see a few problems with you argument. First, when you were talking about the two different views still agreed with Ben Shapiro, in which you casually ommit ( I might have missed spelled it, not my strong suit) and than say &quot;look this way&quot; to say this my argument and here is why &quot; this not what it actually said&quot;. Next, this is the fun one; you attack stats and or data in a model; than immediately, use data &quot;saying why you are wrong&quot; very similar to the oxymoron of the quote at the end. Next, when you said stories, thought of two hot topic cases, when someone who faked being r4ped, and someone who was the actual a victim. Now according to you both cases a true from how you presented your argument; which in this case if we followed what you suggested than the person who lied can&#39;t be a victim. Because of how they feel has that is the correct facts because our perceptions creates the facts because that is how we received multiple views looking at singular debt/story/new article...etc. This than can be applied on doing a crime and or political views where we entered a infinite cycle of everyone having &quot;The King has no clothes syndrome&quot;. This, how we can break cycle, only by facts not being reliant on feelings; as what your suggesting is that; idea similar to those who either, don&#39;t want history known, tries to black mail someone ( similar to how the Catholic Church black mailed it&#39;s followers when Martin Luther wrote his 500 page thesis that he nailed to the church doors), or how minorities can&#39;t be racist because they never had &quot;power&quot;.

 The huge problem with these right-wing ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù is that they go on and on about ‚Äòfacts‚Äô, yet they knowingly present facts in a manipulative way, cherry picking the ones that support their narrative, presenting them in dishonest ways using logical and emotional fallacies, etc. Most of them love to engage in black or white thinking, leading their huge, impressionable audiences to do the same. This leads the audience to accept whatever Ben or whoever says, without taking the time to think through the enormous grey areas that always exist. Ben and friends don‚Äôt want them to see the nuances, bc it will lead them to question what he is saying, and he knows that he can‚Äôt honestly defend some of his views, and if that happens, he will start to lose his credibility. If that were to happen, he would be at risk of losing views and subscribers, and therefore losing some of the easy money he has become so accustomed to, and without that extra cash, he loses a bit of his social standing which makes him feel so superior to the rest of us regular people who struggle to survive  in the real world, sometimes even while working two or three jobs.<br>And he NEEDS to feel superior to all of us non Harvard law school educated people. That is apparent in his smug way of talking down to his audience. It‚Äôs why he feels the need to talk super fast while using big words that are supposed to sound smart. He just rapid fires his opinions at us in an authoritative way. Using just a small amount of critical thinking skills reveals his tactics and exposes the holes in his arguments. <br>At the very hint of such a situation, he immediately goes into defense mode, which includes distracting, deflecting and going on the offense. He‚Äôs even marched off a set in a huff, when asked about his own behavior and statements.<br>So Mr. Fact Boy doesn‚Äôt really like facts as much as he‚Äôd like us to believe.

 It frustrates me when people quote statistics, specifically those which are hand-picked to support the grounds of their arguments. Stats need to be interpreted from their original studies‚Äînot in snarky one-liners. Many times the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù proposed in one context are not reported in the same context as the studies they come from. Also, statistics is a funny thing. Not all values represent what you‚Äôd assume when hearing them. You have to have adequate knowledge of statistics to interpret them as they really are. Additionally, some statistics are not based on the parameters that the public assumes‚Äîsuch as in data visualization, sample sizes, methods, etc. A prime example of how data/stats are misrepresenting is, ‚ÄúMore than 90% of dentists recommended Colgate.‚Äù üôÑ

 &quot;So if facts are so squishy, then why do we still rely on them for so much stuff?&quot; Maybe because it&#39;s better than just devolving into a meaningless power struggle between competing ideologies? All in all this has been an enlightening journey into the reasons for much of the political left&#39;s behaviour in recent years.

 Observation on part of the video: By declaring that all critics of one thing belong in a group, it allows the responder to preemptively dismiss the criticism of a particular idea by implying that that the criticism is only the result of some kind of negative social influence common to that group. Essentially this amounts to poisioning the well. This is probably not any more apparent than with the three people chosen for the example in this video: Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and Ben Shapiro. Sam typically clashes quite profoundly with the ideologies of Jordan and Ben, especially on religion. And they differ with him significantly in many other ways as well. The fact that all three of them arrived at a similar criticism of certain leftist policies and groups, essentially has nothing to do with some kind of in-group tribal identity, but rather as the result of very different processes in each of their respective ideologies. Ben is likely motivated by a sense of right-wing Judeo-Christian tribalism, Jordan to some kind of appeal to the supposed evolutionary ground-truth of biology along with right-wing influence, and Sam likely is likely influenced by ideas of independent thinking that can be found in the atheism and freethought movements.

 I doubt you&#39;ll see this, but maybe someone else will, and if you do, please don&#39;t take offense to what I&#39;m going to say. This is mainly just a disagreement. <br><br>Facts do not care about feelings. However, the interpretation of said facts do. A lot. I find the distinction to be very important. I don&#39;t think my background matters terribly much, but to disclose, I&#39;m a computer scientist with a master&#39;s degree and four publications along with a patent. I&#39;m registered independent, if my political affiliation matters. <br><br>I understand what it means to lie with stats. I understand that it is easy to make research subjective. Veritasium&#39;s P-hacking video goes over the topic of how to get crazily wild relationships out of nothing. I give you that. Starting with bad data will yield bad results. <br><br>Point 1: However, even with that, it must be very clear, facts on themselves stand on their own, and sometimes, they will reveal uncomfortable truths. Your police example is one such. Lets start with some premises, which, if reject then... I guess that&#39;s it for this section. Continuing on though. Premise 1: Crimes happen at a location. Premise 2: Crimes are able to be categorized. Premise 3: Crimes objectively vary in severity. Murder is objectively worse than stealing, ect (I know categorization will be an issue, but bare with me). <br><br>Just with this alone, if we categorize just by only the highest crimes, such as near-fatal assaults, murder and rape based off of previous data. Let&#39;s assume that this data comes from a period of time where police resources were allocated equally among an area as well. What if the results still say lower income areas are still where most of these high-level crimes are? Data is no longer skewed towards petty crimes. Often this IS how these software companies model crime. <br><br>Do we call it discrimination still? Or do we simply associate groups with their characteristics? One could argue such: {Maybe low-income areas are more prone to crime because low income people are more prone to commit crimes. Stealing is risky. Crime is risky. Your average person who isn&#39;t poor will be less likely to kill someone for food. A poor person who is desperate enough might just.} Someone else could easily argue that the data is bad, the methodology is bad.  Well, the real answer is those findings need to be investigated by other parties. That&#39;s why science values &#39;repeatability&#39;. Side point, you also assume that if crime goes down resources will stay the same. Police officers may also start going to other areas. <br><br>Point 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=16m35s">16:35</a> You say Data is dependent on feelings. This. Is. FALSE. And thinking such a way is dangerous. That said, there is data that is not useful. For example, I may find a correlation with the amount of apples I eat compared to how well my wifi is working. But they&#39;re completely unrelated points. It&#39;s not like eating an apple will suddenly make my wifi get better. It&#39;s why the design is important. Emotions may drive design, surely. But if design is sound, the creator&#39;s experiment may still be valid. This is most apparent in the documentary &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; on Netflix. They created an experiment, followed it through, and despite their expectations that the experiment would show that it&#39;s &#39;flat&#39;, it turns out it says it&#39;s round. This is why it&#39;s important to look through the process. <br><br>Point 3: Your idea that &#39;perceived objectivity of data&#39; is a problem is correct. However, solution to such is almost contradictory. We need to stop praising neutrality? But we also need to disclose and overcome our biases allow us to be neutral. You come so close to the actual problem, and yet you don&#39;t get there. Individuals need to vet their sources, understand the difference between good experiment design and bad, find flaws in the systems they&#39;re using. One of the papers I use has a completely original grading system for the transparency of privacy policies in smart homes. But the system is just that. A man made measuring tool. The tool can be wrong. It can be right. But there is something far more important. Who tells you. Reading from the source and letting you come to your own conclusions is the most important. If anything, facts need to be analyzed and tested by YOURSELF. Things are especially dangerous when people read through a lens. It&#39;s why &#39;objective news&#39; is so important. Saying what the news is. No interpretation. No spin. Just news. Just journalism. Just research. We MUST praise neutrality and make it our goal. It&#39;s what keeps our biases in check. <br><br>Conclusion: Facts don&#39;t care about feelings. Interpretation does. And the lens you view these facts is the most important thing. &#39;Perceived objectivity of data&#39; is a problem. But it&#39;s solved by fact checking yourself. Not through 3rd party fact checkers, but the main source. The problems you refer to are caused by looking at facts that have been cut down and warped from their original source. And if you still have issues? Then you scrutinize methodology. And if that&#39;s solid and there are still correlations you don&#39;t like? Then study such a topic yourself. Instead of saying something like &quot;This police data is biased&quot;, maybe conduct a study from scratch trying to solve the question &quot;Are poorer people committing higher levels of violent crime?&quot; Unfortunately, people are too afraid of the answer being yes.

 The problem to your argument is that, if you believe that there is an absolute truth, then facts don&#39;t care about your feelings. Maybe Shapiro is wrong, but hi will be objectively wrong.<br>All your case about models seem silly to me. If the model said crimes occur in poor neighborhoods. As sad as it is, more crimes happen there. So sending the police there and reducing overall crimes by 20% is good. That is 20% less victims to crimes. People that have, not only feelings, consequences of those crimes might feel different than you. So why would police have to change the model because you feel it oppresses the poor? The reality is that delinquents oppress them, and police try to help them.<br><br>About objectivity is being aware of your biases... It is not. It is being capable of ignoring them, and find something that holds true in the real world trough experimentation. Objectivity is also the capability of finding something that is beyond doubt, tied to an object reality, or material reality. Not perceptual reality or conceptual reality. <br><br>The problems here is that people claim to be objective in times when they are not.<br>Also, sometimes people try to find objective realities to metaphysical stuff. Like sexuality or human sciences. No one has ever being able to actually do that, so any that claim so are lairs.

 Excellent video.

For instance, when people talk about the prevalence of crime as it pertains to certain communities, they‚Äôre typically thinking only of street crime (which is more likely to be carried out by poorer people). Other, arguably more pernicious forms of crime such as corporate embezzlement and large scale corruption largely gets overlooked because the perpetrators of such crimes fall outside the average person‚Äôs ::ahem:: perception of what a criminal is.

 Well, the facts (or rather the world around us) does not in fact care about our feelings. This video basically says that our personal interpretation of these facts is influenced by our feelings. In science there&#39;s this one thing called peer review, which exists to counteract any feelings that sneak into scientific papers. In science a fact is a consensus about something, so a large majority of scientists with different feelings all agree on the fact to be true.<br><br>This should be true with statistics as well. Get a large majority of experts to agree on &quot;the fact&quot;, and there&#39;s a high probability of it being true.<br><br>The whole example with the police patrols - I didn&#39;t see exactly what the issue was. Input data included minor crimes that primarily happen in poor neighborhoods. Ok, what&#39;s the issue? Were they trying to exclude minor crimes on their patrol routes? <br>What exactly is police trying to achieve? Decrease murder rate by 20%? Then input murder rates only. Maybe stop violent crimes? Input only violent crimes. Decrease the overall crime rate that includes minor crimes? Input all crimes. The video says that the police chief did something wrong, but doesn&#39;t really explain what it is and why it is so.

 Even if there were such a thing as &quot;objective facts&quot; (and I would say that there are), that doesn&#39;t tell you what to do with them.  Suppose we had a perfect model of all crime in an area.  That doesn&#39;t tell us what to do with that information.  That doesn&#39;t say that sending more police to hot spot areas will &quot;reduce crime&quot; since, after all, the cops generally can only act after the fact.  The presence of the cops might give an incentive for people to not commit crime while the cop is around, but that is only a temporary solution to the changing the end result.  It doesn&#39;t actually address the causes of crime.<br><br>So even if we could state that &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings,&quot; it is most certainly the case that your feelings determine what you do with the facts.

 Overall I liked the video, but I have qualms with you shoving the entire IDW under one big hat. It&#39;s mainly Ben Shapiro who coined the phrase &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot;. Other members of this &quot;group&quot; have different reasons for finding like-minded people in each other. One core issue which they address is the degree to which political correctness prevents them from having a discussion about certain topics. <br><br>The best example, in my opinion, is the bill C-16 debacle, which Jordan Peterson criticized on judicious grounds. His complaint was that the state had no right to enforce what words people used. He saw that as a very severe breach of people&#39;s freedom of speech. However, people took that take and framed him as a transphobe, an alt-right advocate, a nazi, etc. trying to shut him down so that there wasn&#39;t even the room to engage with him in a discussion.<br><br>I don&#39;t have the sources on what makes Sam Harris such a controversial figure, but I suppose it&#39;s his criticism of Islam, which is then seen as Islamophobia. But we live in a free society where every idea can be criticized. Sam Harris isn&#39;t criticizing Muslims in general, he is criticizing certain ideas prevalent within Islam belief. But people are unwilling to engage him in that discussion. The Intellectual Dark Web isn&#39;t just shaped by people who went to get away with saying whatever the hell they want, a lot of its &quot;members&quot; are intellectuals who are provided no opportunity to discuss these topics on traditional platforms. <br><br>A final example is Brett Weinstein who also considers himself to be part of the Intellectual Dark Web. However, he lost his job at Evergreen state college on the basis of the most ridiculous accusation. He criticized the Day of Absence which enforced that white students stay home. He was labeled a racist and harassed by an angry mob, which ultimately led him to resign. Whilst trying to explain himself to these people, they kept interrupting him and filling in for him what he meant. He was given no opportunity to have a civil discussion with them.<br><br>Why am I being so lengthy about this? Because this, to me, isn&#39;t a matter of being right or wrong. This is a matter of people being given the space to discuss ideas and perhaps even the validity of their ideas. I am not saying these Dark Web Intellectuals are always right in whatever they are saying, but if they are wrong, then show that through engaging in a discussion with them. By shutting them out, silencing them, and accusing them of being bigots, racists, and transphobes, you are creating your own enemies. Now I am not saying that you, specifically are doing this, but by framing this group as a bunch of people who all hold the same ideas and associating the phrase &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; with all of them instead of just Ben Shapiro, you are making a generalization which is not in line with the reality of their individual views. Are these people influenced by their feelings? Most likely, but as your own video points out, this doesn&#39;t make the ideas they espouse any less valid.

 The amount of fallacy in these arguments is mind boggling. I know I&#39;ll get I&#39;ll get crucified for this... but here goes.<br><br>I&#39;m a smart man. I know the whole study of statistics - as you say an &quot;expert.&quot; Which you are clearly not even close to.  I&#39;m also someone in a poor neighborhood, who due to depression and poverty after some bad breaks knows a thing or two.<br><br>The facts don&#39;t lie.<br><br>First of all... studies are almost always skewed by the people doing them... as in feelings. That&#39;s why most people NEVER trust studies as facts, including Shapiro. I don&#39;t like defending him even though I agree with him on some stuff, but he looks at EVERY study and takes in all the data... which everyone should instead of handpicking your own. I wrote a paper on video games inciting violence that took in studies from all sides... turns out most of the time it is inconclusive as a causative factor vs a correlation.<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m also a computer scientist - an expert. Real data - REAL data, doesn&#39;t lie. Percentages don&#39;t lie. Now, census data DOES lie. So the police data... that&#39;s just what they have. Also... the police make money on arrests. That explains that in one concise sentence. They get data about the amount of crimes that, let&#39;s face it, is just plain true. The FACT is the police want to make money. This is from - as you say - an expert in a poor neighborhood seeing it firsthand.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but you are speaking about things you don&#39;t truly know about. People have feelings, yes.

 About the crime models.  If the crime is where they say it is, and you do not show a reading that they missed a lot of crimes by not being elsewhere, then the models were right, and there is a correlation between poverty areas and crime.  But that&#39;s not news.  And it&#39;s not classism if they catch more impoverished people committing crimes.  It&#39;s only classism if you can show the non-impoverished getting away with crimes.  Also, if a disproportionate amount of criminals are caught in the impoverished section, that&#39;s good for the quality of life in the impoverished section.  Why do you want them to have more criminals running loose?  And why would you want more cops to be wasted on the well to do section if they&#39;re not needed there?<br><br>You know, Ben is right, facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.  Any fact that is actually a fact is not a living being with an ability to care.  But you are also right that facts are subject to interpretation.  Living beings have to determine what they mean and what to do with them.  And interpretations may differ.<br><br>Trouble is a lot of what is offered as fact these days (on both sides of the isle) are not facts.  And a lot of the issues, such as Trans issues, are not fact based anyway.  They are feeling based, and any feelings I have as a Trans person do not care about Ben Shapiro&#39;s facts.  As a Trans person I reject facts and regard my feelings as the only reality of consequence.  And these are not matters I need Ben to agree with me on.  Indeed, it&#39;s really my feelings vs. his opinions.  Facts have nothing to do with it.<br><br>Still, sometimes Ben says some things that make sense, as do his companions that you mentioned.  They are not dumb people.  They are just people with opinions who are as worthy to be listened to and have their words considered as anyone on the other side of the isle.  From all the talking heads on the internet you take what you can use and discard the rest.  But smart people will never say &quot;I won&#39;t listen&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll depend on someone else to tell me what they say.&quot;  <br><br>I find you questioning why anyone is listening to them to be anti-intellectual.  Especially since you seem to be attributing ideas to them that aren&#39;t theirs.  I don&#39;t think any of them subscribe to racist IQ theory.  I know who does subscribe to that theory, but you&#39;ve probably never heard of him.  But I know the 4 people you mentioned don&#39;t like him or his theory one bit.<br><br>But you see, here again we are not dealing with facts.  You have opinions about people you&#39;re probably scared to even look into for yourself.  Actually, that&#39;s called prejudice.  And they probably have prejudices about you too.  This is what happens when people are forbidden to get together and look for common ground.  You have nothing to base any opinion on but prejudice.<br><br>In a world where prejudice rules on all sides, facts don&#39;t matter, and neither do feelings.  My feelings only matter if somebody cares about them, and I see no evidence that anyone does.  If I want somebody to care about my feelings I must join a group and be subject to any prejudices that are believed about that group.  But there is no group I can join that cares about my feelings as an individual.  I must conform to the stereotype to have my feelings cared about.  But then they would not be my feelings.<br><br>I choose not to be a political ping pong ball for the Left and the Right to play with.  I am as indifferent to each of them as they are to my feelings as an individual.  So the rejected individual does not care about facts or feelings.  He just looks for a place to hide from a totally clueless society that has no potential to ever get anything right.

But still he trusted the data as provable as opposed to a possibility. <br><br>Apparently what I said that helped was to consider the opinions of intuitive people in his life who he likes and trusts as a point of data in his &quot;logical&quot; decision making process. The intuitive opinion may not sway him if overwhelmed by the other data, but it did have some influence in decisions where the data was inconclusive. And at least it allowed him to realize some value in the opinions of his friends and family improving his relationships.

 Even as someone staunchly on the right, I can see how that statement is incorrect. Reality is subjective to human reasoning, and human reasoning is subject to emotion. We interpret reality through various psychological sequences, and our feelings aren‚Äôt exempt for those sequences. It is difficult to determine what is and isn‚Äôt fact, especially since it is human nature to have confirmation bias. We don‚Äôt accept facts on its own. Our view of reality is determined by our personal experiences, religious beliefs, political ideology, education, the news we watch, and the limits of human thinking power. Facts might not care about our feelings, but what we say is and isn‚Äôt fact is greatly impacted by our feelings. It‚Äôs an interesting dilemma

 You are correct that feelings effect your perception of facts. That is why it is important to be able to change your opinions based on new data. The data, however, points to certain things. <br><br>In the case of crime statistics, while I agree that the feedback loop created by increased policing is a problem which should be dealt with by still spreading police around lower crime areas as well, there was objectively more crime in those zones prior to the model being created and the data shows that crime went down by basing patrols on that data, and there is nothing wrong with that. <br><br>I find it concerning that you seem to assert that scientists shouldn&#39;t be unbiased, but to acknowledge their bias and &quot;move past it&quot;. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;move past it&quot; but isn&#39;t the point of acknowledging your bias to eliminate it? I shouldn&#39;t simply say &quot;I&#39;m an asshole&quot; and then do nothing to be better. <br><br>Your final message of &quot;your feelings don&#39;t care about facts&quot; is a nice clever inversion and sounds cool, but you&#39;ve really just rephrased the same thing been Shapiro believes. If you are blinded by your feelings, you won&#39;t see the facts. And your feelings do not change that. &quot;Facts depend on ideology&quot; no they don&#39;t. What I believe or you believe does not change what is true. You&#39;ve done a really good job of moving the goal post and redefining facts to fit your argument, but you&#39;re still wrong. <br><br>Just because our perception of data changes, does not mean the data changed. Your feelings can make you believe incorrect facts, but does not change the true ones.

 Data can be skewed to say anything we want, if we ask the questions in a way that prompts it to do so. People like Ben Shapiro are well known for cherry picking data to fit their stance, rather that even attempting to get data thats as objective as we can make it. It may never be perfect but we CAN combat the biases that exist by looking for multiple sources, doing our best to ask as many questions as possible rather than a single one, and by listening to people on the ground who are directly affected by our decisions. People who are being honest about those things will always do their best to make sure everyone knows as much, that their data ISNT infallible, and that there could be room for improvement and mistakes.<br>This is literally the point of peer review in the scientific community. It both assures as accurate as possible process, as well as calling into question anything that seems to be heavily affected by personal bias of the author. It&#39;s also another wonderful reason to have articles with multiple authors. Everything has room for improvement, especially science.

 There are objective truths. Truth is any fact which corresponds to reality. It is that part of reality which doesn&#39;t depend on us or that we can&#39;t change on a whim. There are also subjective truths. That is anything part of reality that is dependent upon us. For example, I might say that I like chocolate, therefore chocolate is good. But is that last part an objective truth? No! There are many people in the world who do not like chocolate, and so chocolate might actually be bad for them. So can we say that &#39;chocolate is good&#39; is an subjective truth? Yes, absolutely! Why? Because it varies from person to person.

 A fact is knowledge or information based on real occurrences therefore it is incapable of replicating human emotions so no facts do not care about your feelings. <br>      A more appropriate title for this video would be facts are an objective reality capable of being perceived differently.  In the video she claims that your world view is based upon how you perceive facts which in itself is true but that does not change the facts themselves you are the one changing the facts to fit your narrative, the facts are not changing to fit your world view you are the one doing that. All in all what I would like to say is facts are facts regardless of how human emotions interpret them the way Ben Shapiro interprets statistics has nothing to do with what they mean. For example if I pull up some random poll that says woman are 52% more likely to like strawberry‚Äôs it doesn‚Äôt matter why you or Ben think women are more likely to like strawberry‚Äôs the fact will remain women are 52% more likely to like strawberry‚Äôs.<br><br>And I would like to add around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=9m20s">9:20</a> you claimed Ben thinks iq is different depending upon race or gender which is absurd I would like some evidence for that claim I my self do not watch Ben Shapiro but I think I can safely say he has never said that and doesn‚Äôt believe it either.

 As someone who does believe in the enlightenment idea of everything is grounded in facts, I do not like how feelings don&#39;t count as fact. Everything is grounded in fact means EVERYTHING, including feelings. I feel fear because it was an evolutionary response to danger. I don&#39;t know the scientific explanation behind trans people but since they&#39;re humans with a working brain, I know there is one. And climate change is definitely a thing, and wasn&#39;t discovered by activists but scientists.

 Facts are facts whether you like them or not. Now, the way you interpret those facts is determined by your feelings, your personal experience, and so on. The way you feel about them doesn&#39;t change them, facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, your feelings are altered by the facts.

 IMHO those guys are a shame for the people that trie to base their live decisions on facts and objectivity, cause they are just making bad science and wearing this as facts, of course we are biased but is ever good to remember that science is made by a lot of people that are constantly revising the work off each other and sanding the bias along the time through experimentation , this system of course have some flaws that may appear when large groups off people are biased for the same wrong conclusion or when someone is just intellectually dishonest, but the system does work and has made most off the marvelous that the humanity today is capable of possible.

 Interesting video. I would agree that our perception of facts is colored by our feelings and presuppositions. However, I am of the opinion that the properties that make up a rock would still be just that if there were no human minds present to observe the rock. I believe it is true that no one is free of bias or faulty logic but I think that constantly working to minimize our bias in an effort to understand objective reality as clearly as possible is one of the most worthwhile goals one can strive for. Shedding one&#39;s bias is no easy task and if you&#39;re not careful, the discovery of fault with one bias can lead to the acceptance of an opposing one if a healthy dose of skepticism is not employed across the board.

 This is just playing a game of semantics in order to say that a popular phrase is wrong. Yes of course &quot;facts&quot; could be wrong or biased or an incomplete picture, but then they aren&#39;t really facts are they? One of the synonyms for fact is &#39;truth&#39;. So you could say &#39;Truth doesn&#39;t care about your feelings&#39;. So long as we&#39;re talking about something that is actually true, the truth of it won&#39;t change based on someone&#39;s feelings. How they view that truth might change the &#39;truthfulness&#39; of it in their own eyes, but it won&#39;t change the actual truth.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter if everything Ben has ever said is a &#39;fact&#39; is wrong. All you&#39;re doing is saying that his facts aren&#39;t actually facts. It doesn&#39;t matter how angry you are that 2 + 2 = 4, that fact will still remain unchanged. The whole point of the phrase is that if you disagree that 2 + 2 = 4, the way to disprove it is with evidence and not with emotions. Facts are not alive, so it is impossible for them to care about anything.<br><br>Really, I agree with everything you&#39;re saying in the video about bias and perception of truth.

 I‚Äôd say that if facts are understood as absolute truths that can to be discovered they dont care about your feelings, as they are true regardless of how one feels. However, feelings can result in the use of a none representative data sample as well as a biased interpretation of data. Both of thse would lead to the fabrication of fake facts, which arent actual facts. So facts wouldn‚Äôt care about any feelings (unless the fact is about feelings ofc).

 You make some good points, but I can&#39;t help but find the justification for the proposition that facts do care about feelings as convoluted. Early on you make the point that our perception of facts is dependent upon our faculties which includes our feelings. Later though the idea that keeps being presented is that facts themselves are squishy and malleable. <br><br>In the first case it seems that we could grant the point and yet say that this doesn&#39;t mean that facts themselves care about feelings; it could just be that our perception of facts cares about feelings which would be a substantive difference. <br><br>In the second case it seems that facts can only be said to care about about feelings if the squishiness of facts means that feelings are themselves are part of what makes up a fact. If this is the intended conceptualization of what facts are then facts do care about feelings because feelings are a part of facts and feelings care. <br><br>I myself prefer a third way. I see feelings themselves as facts. Starting from this basic observation we can still affirm the role feelings play in conducting analyses and we can can also affirm the factual basis of feelings , their important impact on society, and how they are a part of the things we value most in our lives as members of society.

 Having studied objectivism in my youth, I have gone through, and admit I will likely always be going through, an exploration of the validity of my thinking. Objectivity was basically the idea that existence exists independently of any consciousness. I tend to hold this as a foundational truth. But my consciousness has an &quot;imperfect&quot; connection to it. And my mind has to interpret. So you raise good points. At present I&#39;m at the point where my definition of objectivity is that it is the product of subjective collectivism. Or collective subjectivism. I could be getting that mixed up. Ultimately, it would seem objectivity is a concensus of a subjective collaboration. Of course there is the input or guidance of actual physical measurements and comparisons. So therein lies the attempt to tie the subjective to that which exists independently of any consciousness. But one still has to select which aspects of reality are pertinent. Nice work again, here. Your videos have a great deal of interesting approaches. I&#39;ll have to watch again as my mind tends to go off on tangents when triggered to explore an interesting thought.

 After his take on Atheism in his &quot;conversation&quot; with Matt Dilahunty,  I think Jordan Peterson can not be consider to be part of &quot;the group of academic outsiders who value logic, rationality, and free speech above all else&quot;, he was so dishonest I really couldn&#39;t believe what I was listening to.  Also, it doesn&#39;t matter how you put it, facts still do not care, not just about feelings, but about anything, because facts are abstract concepts not entities. Another totally different topic is the fact that people misuse data, entities disguise their biased chosen data as facts. We need to be careful with semiotics so we don&#39;t end up changing the meaning of the symbols our brains uses to point at concepts, epistemology is a very delicate topic. I would argue that there are liars who presents corrupted data as facts, there are also inadvertent scholars or other people trusting this data, but usually there are ways to be confident about the data you collect, specially if we are talking about what is established as scientific models (like the climate change).  The sentence &quot;I care about the truth&quot; should not be misused, but unfortunately this falls again in the conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; dilemma of which part is the right one, but as we all know, there are concepts we should not allow because they are very dangerous, I would argue that climate change is such a concept. I&#39;ll also undoubtedly place in that category many of the topic that religious extremist exploit, and as extremist I am not just talking about suicide bombers, I would include those who take seriously what the bible states about women just to give you an example. So peoples morals vary somehow and some religious people can put a line quite further away from where others do, I would argue that Sam Harris will not swallow some of the things religions will try to make you eat, and to some religious people this can make then feel bad, but again it is a fact that your holly book says those things and the rules of your specific religion allows you to do an say some things which in fact are dangerous and bad for others. I would point out also that not even you could avoid having to resort to expressions like &quot;in fact&quot; or &quot;factual&quot; which implies that you need to point to true events that are not subject to interpretation.

 You say that you care about words and their meaning. Then you go on to talk about the intellectual dark web, creating a negative image of the people you are talking about. It would appear that you care more about manipulating thought and perception than truth. I don&#39;t find this form of argument credible when used to try to convince me that your perception of reality is more valid than my perception of reality.

 So it seems to me that there is a bit of confusion on a fact actually is or the magnitude of importance it has. What you learn when studying science and technology is that facts are the weakest form of scientific certainty, because facts change constantly and often disagree with each other based on framing. I saw someone arguing about covid deaths in a small town so I will use this example. If a report were to say that 100 deaths in the town had preexisting conditions that would be a correct fact. Another report could say only 50 of those deaths have preexisting conditions and that can, at the same time be a true fact. And another with only 25 being true as well. The difference comes from what the people consider preexisting conditions, the first saying any condition, even a broken foot for example. the second narrowing it to any nose and throat related condition, like chronic sore throat. The last might be notable lung damage prior to covid as the base line. All 3 of those facts are true, but framed differently, and which one is relevant then becomes a judgment call which, as it is made by people, is inherently biased (aka, based on feelings) even some of the examples that are used in the comments such as 1+1=2 isn&#39;t always true because in binary (base 2) it equals 10, and you determine which base you use according to what is useful or significant to a situation you are in. The example that the grass is green is a fact, but if I said it&#39;s actually emerald, then the scope of how exact we want to get with the naming is the scope, and what reference we are using for the names effects it too, thus our own histories. As soon as you translate am observation into a claim, you make a decision on what is important and what scope or framing you want to present. And if that scope is different from a different observers, even though you both have facts, they are not the same. That&#39;s why the discussion in the video is so important. You have to know what frame of reference you are looking at.

 I mean facts technically don&#39;t care about our feelings, but our feelings do help us determine what evidence we think tells the facts, like the shape of the Earth won&#39;t change no matter what my feelings on the subject are but if my feelings tell me it&#39;s flat I&#39;m more likely to believe that the facts tell me that and same if I feel like it&#39;s round.

 My job is literally developing platforms to process petabytes of data to yield insights. One argument that I hoped Bee would state explicitly is that: 1) Data is not facts. It is just data. Various things can go wrong, perhaps due to design and implementation of the data-collection process, that can compromise that data. 2) Models are trained. To train a model, data must be selected with which to feed to the model. This process is not automated; it is human choice. 3) If the output of a model is useful at all, which is not guaranteed, then it is only applicable in the same, extremely narrow circumstances under which the training set was collected. 4) Drawing conclusions from model output is a purely human process.<br><br>So here we have a system where human choice and therefore bias has infected its every aspect. We don&#39;t need to even ask what facts are, getting into the weeds of epistemology, to conclude that model-building is not inherently trustworthy. Instead, the question comes down to trust: Which specific humans collected data for the model? Which humans selected a subset of data for the model? Which specific humans decided when the model was trained sufficiently for their purposes? Which humans received the output of the model and drew conclusions based on that output?<br><br><br>And do I trust those humans?

 I believe that this is not an all or nothing topic. There can be some facts which do not care about feelings and some facts which do care about feelings. I&#39;ll write a couple examples of each type of fact.<br><br>Existence is a fact which must be accepted. On some level, you must accept that existing is a fact of life. Even if you can&#39;t accept the existence of an external thing such as grass, you must accept your own existence before you can form opinions or feelings about it. But suppose you feel that you don&#39;t like the idea of existing. Does your existence then cease? I have heard several accounts of people who believe that it would have been better for them to never have been born. And from others&#39; observations of those people I have heard that they did continue existing even after such a feeling formed within them. They were miserable. And if anything, that misery only made their existence more evident to themselves and others. So in summary, I think that existence is one fact on which we must accept without regard to our feelings. We exist whether we want to or not, and we can cease to exist whether we want to or not. If you can&#39;t accept the fact that you do exist, then do you actually exist? Who&#39;s denying the existence? Some who doesn&#39;t exist can&#39;t deny anything. So I can say that SOME facts do not care about my feelings regarding them. {Some other interesting things happen when you try to prove the existence of external objects, whether they be concrete or abstract. I won&#39;t comment on that here, but you might want to consider it.}<br><br> Now how about facts caring about feelings? Well, I do in fact love the color yellow on small flowers. Does that fact care about my feelings? Yes, because if my feelings about the color yellow change, then the fact will change from true to false. So I can also say that SOME facts do care about feelings. I agree that it is important to attempt to differentiate between the two types of facts, and that you must be considerate of you own and other people&#39;s feelings to do that effectively. <br><br>So those were examples of two different types of facts. I believe there are both.<br><br>Funnily enough, this is all based on my own philosophical beliefs. I can&#39;t say whether that means they are based on my feelings or not because I am unaware of having any care one way or the other. It just seems to be the most sensible (think of the senses) view to me. And to me, the senses not inherently good or bad, unless I make them so. Why would I care one way or the other when deciding this? Accept or reject my impression of this topic as you will. I just wished to share my POV here.<br><br>What do you think?<br>Does this make sense to anyone else?

 The people who listen to Ben Shapiro, and other right wing commentators, tend to be lonely young men or divorced dads who harbor a lot of resentment and anger for those they feel wronged by. These channels reenforce their feelings of anger and resentment by telling them that yes, all your problems and the problems of society are not your fault. They are the fault of (insert hated group here) feminists, minorities, cultural Marxists, etc. They provide their audiences with a convenient scapegoat for all their problems while simultaneously telling them that they are good and superior to the scapegoated group simply because they are white, male, cis, etc. At the heart of all this lies a deep and  crushing insecurity.

 its not hard to be objective. Its not hard to read multiple articles and find out who funded them to see whether theyre impartial or not. If you&#39;re trying to stop crime, you go to areas with high crime rates. It doesn&#39;t matter why those areas have high crime rates. It is objectively true that poor areas have higher crime rates. It&#39;s not hard to use logical reasoning to figure out why poor underprivileged neighborhoods have higher crime rates. Being poor does not excuse committing crimes. The facts are the facts. They will always be fact. The way you interpret the facts does not change that they are facts. The reasoning behind facts does not change that they are facts. There is a large argument behind the reason for these statistics but to have the conversation about how to change these facts you first have to acknowledge what the facts are. some people refuse to acknowledge facts that cannot be denied.

 When you think about it tho, this is actually a really terrifying prospect. It&#39;s probably why Propaganda exists or why we&#39;ve had so many devastating failures in the history of medicine for example, like when lobotomies were believed to be genuine curals but today are seen as inhumane methods of disfiguration &amp; torture that were practiced 80-70 years ago. Facts &amp; evidence are often what give humanity a sense of control, order &amp; understanding in an otherwise unforgivingly confusing &amp; unpredictable world. If you take that away with subjective intentions, human error, lack of information, and the perceptual use of it&#39;s meaning, it can change the very fabric of what we uphold as sacredly true in the most terrifying way

I just read an article earlier today from the Sacramento Bee in which Shapiro was commenting on that very issue of racial IQ differences in response to some kid&#39;s misguided science project. While he did say that tests had shown differences in average IQ between races, he basically dismissed that fact as men like Jordan Peterson and Thomas Sowell also do by pointing out that the variation is even higher within groups than between them and that IQ tends to increase relative to former generations and a number of other confounding factors.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t seem to be how you presented his opinion here, though again I can&#39;t seem to find the quote and I don&#39;t want to take 20 minutes to find it again (if someone can reply with a timestamp, I would appreciate it).

 I appreciate that you pointed out the importance of narrative and the inescapable fact that we are all human and often have a tendency to dismiss facts that we don&#39;t like. But I find it somewhat ironic that in the story you shared about the Reading police force you seemed to imply that increased policing in poorer neighborhoods had a disproportionately negative effect on the people of those communities, and yet the only fact you cited was a 23% decrease in burglaries over the first year. How is being robbed LESS a bad thing?<br><br>Mass incarceration and a number of things in our criminal justice system need some serious work, but making an implication that more police is bad while only presenting evidence to the contrary seems counter-productive. But it is an interesting commentary on the whole facts/feelings caring issue. Is there something I&#39;m missing here? Perhaps O&#39;Neil provides further statistics in her book. Could you share any of those if so?<br><br>Also, are you suggesting that there are lots of unreported crimes in higher income neighbors that don&#39;t figure into the model but would be stopped by a larger police presence if only they would patrol there instead?

 I&#39;m not convinced. If the police data had wrong weightings (ie. putting too much weight on victimless crimes); then sure... that&#39;s a gigo problem. But if they are counting a specific kind of crime (eg. burglaries), the location will tell you the location of the <i>victim,</i> just as much as the perpetrator. If crimes are down 23% by concentrating on certain areas, that means they had an effect - provided, of course, that it wasn&#39;t just that crime had moved to victims who chose not to report it. If they are policing black areas, they are also preventing blacks from becoming victims.<br><br>It shouldn&#39;t be a bad thing to have a police presence in your neighborhood. If it is, then that is the fault of the way police conduct their operations, not that they are there to begin with.

 Science is not squish and bias is not inevitable. That&#39;s only true when the researches have the same result expectations. In the case of the examples you cited they not only were tested by a bunch of different researches but they also have the additional fact that they would prove the researches theroies wrong. So they were both tested by a bunch of researches and had a undesirable outcome witch only reinforces that the facts are true. The facts exist and are indisputable.

 Really this argument fell flat on its face with the policing example. The department placed resources where they had data showing that more crime was occurring (the author and Zoe‚Äôs feeling that some of the crime was due to economic issues or should not be pursued are their feelings and don‚Äôt somehow show a bias in the data) burglaries went down. The place where feelings come in on this example is the feeling that it was bad to place the police there because that‚Äôs ‚Äúcriminalizing poverty‚Äù there was little to nothing provided in this example to show that biases corrupted the data collection or the implementation. <br>This seems to give the facts over feelings crowd the point. You can say I feel we are criminalizing the poor and they can say we put cops where crime was reported and objectively fewer people got burgled. <br>I‚Äôm all about poor folks not being burgled or otherwise victimized by crime so I‚Äôll admit I like that outcome.

 A couple of thoughts:<br><br>- No-one has ever come up with an entirely objective version of morality. At best, objectivity can answer &quot;is&quot; questions, but it says nothing about &quot;ought&quot; questions. And the moment you start talking about what people should or shouldn&#39;t do, you&#39;re in the territory of the latter, not the former. It&#39;s entirely possible to start from an innoccuous seeming premise like &quot;human life is precious&quot; and, through rigorous, objective reasoning, arrive at the conclusion that the ideal world is something like the human fields of the Matrix without all that dangerous virtual reality that could kill people - endless ranks of pods containing comatose humans, each kept alive as long as possible by machines. After all, letting humans walk around means there&#39;s a risk they&#39;ll trip and fall and land awkwardly and break their own necks and die.<br><br>The facts are that if you care about human life, you should be campaigning for induced comas - it&#39;ll postpone people&#39;s deaths. The trouble with this conclusion is that feelings are only being taken account of on the input end when they&#39;re being translated into goals that are only what people think they want, not what they actually want. You need to not only check that the initial goals or values are things you feel are right; you also need to evaluate the conclusions to check that what you think is what you want is really expressing what you want well enough, rather than something that sounds about right, but is actually horrifying if you explore the implications.<br><br>- When talking about facts and data, there are two questions it&#39;s important to ask. The one everyone asks is &quot;what&#39;s the answer?&quot; but the one that&#39;s easy to forget is &quot;what question did I actually answer?&quot;<br><br>For example, an awful lot of psychology experiments have been (and probably still are) performed on student volunteers (for obvious reasons) which immediately introduces two different sample biases - &quot;student&quot; and &quot;volunteer&quot; - which means that any conclusions about, say, the willingness to electrocute a stranger painfully and even lethally are actually conclusions about students who volunteer for experiments, not necessarily about the general population (in fact, about specific students at a specific campus who volunteered for a specific experiment).<br><br>Or to take an example from the video, the police thought their model was answering the question &quot;where are police needed?&quot; or possibly &quot;where are crimes committed?&quot; when it was actually answering the question &quot;where are crimes reported?&quot;<br><br>Ideally, the question you ask should be a good proxy for the question you want answered, but, as with reasoning how best to achieve approximations to your true values/goals, answering an approximation of the question you actually want answered can produce a very different answer.

 I think about 1/2 or less of what you are saying is true. With the crime example: It is easy enough to collect ALL of the reported crime data, this wouldn&#39;t reflect crimes that victims tend to report less like domestic abuse and rape, but for crimes that are usually reported you can definitively say whether or not certain crimes occur in poor neighborhoods more frequently. Furthermore, to send fewer police into areas of high crime because there may be some unseen implicit bias would be a disservice to upstanding residents in that area. Also you put up quite a few straw men. I don&#39;t think any of the dark web guys I know about say there is no climate change, but rather that any major attempt to assuage it will result in a huge cost (making things worse for future generations) without tipping the scales significantly.

 So basically...the way we present and interpret facts/statistics depends on the (biases of) people doing those things. For instance, I&#39;m not sure that scientific research included all possible data or presented the data properly, so I won&#39;t completely believe it. Or I&#39;m not sure this video has proper research backing it, so I won&#39;t completely believe it.<br><br>It seems it&#39;s best each individual goes out into the field to do their own research, then they&#39;d be free to interpret data how they&#39;d like.<br><br>And what&#39;s the point of striving to put aside biases if you know in the first place you can&#39;t be unbiased?

Even if there is a measured difference between sexes or races, that could easily be caused by racism or sexism. Have these people ever taken an IQ test?

 It depends on what we mean by &#39;facts&#39;. If we are talking about things that are as they are in the world, independently of our perception of them, those are objective. But once we perceive them, our perception of them is not and cannot be objective. And since what we present as &#39;facts&#39; in discussion and inquiry are in fact (ha!) our perceptions of things in the world, those facts are not objective either. We should endeavor to make our factual perceptions as accurate as possible, as little distorted by bias as possible, but nothing completely objective will come of it, because they are still perceptions experienced and interpreted by a subject. So, Shapiro is wrong if he means the sorts of &#39;facts&#39; he would be using in a debate.

 Good video with a lot of fear points and valid criticism. I work in IT with machine learning - I know how templates can overfit the provided data. But I still feel that it is better to use them, rather than not. Sending more police officers in a place that statistically has more crime is a way more valid solution, than spreading out the entire force equally threw out the entire area where 60% of cops will do nothing all day because nothing happens in places they are at and 5% will be overwhelmed. Yes - you can argue, that due to unequal distribution of policing there will be more crime registered in those highlighted areas, but we shouldn&#39;t defend criminals and say - they are getting caught and punished only because cops route this route more often. A criminal is a criminal. If you are a law-abiding citizen living in a dangerous neighborhood - more policing to punish the criminals and make the neighborhood more safe seems like a perfectly valid solution to me.

There are ways to look at facts objectively. Sam is one of the best at doing exactly that. Facts themselves are not based on any feeling. Also there are different kind of facts, and some facts (or all) are not absolute and are temporary.

 Calculus is an amazing invention that helps us most with systems whose behaviour unfolds smoothly, like the weather, moving objects, flowing liquids. It is also useful for finding the best combination of elements in a design or plan. A person who knows about calculus is not doing something wrong with their life.<br><br>Newton did not develop calculus through &#39;the scientific method&#39;. He did it by reasoning logically but in an innovative and brilliant way. This kind of reasoning predates the Enlightenment (e.g. ancient Greek mathematics). Indeed, effective thinking goes back beyond history. It&#39;s what works to understand and control systems we can&#39;t plead with or charm, like your health, an aeroplane, or electricity. The Enlightenment was just a period of particularly rapid development. That development has continued and is continuing. There is no single &#39;scientific method&#39; but the collection of methods and tools we use has improved and gradually increased the efficiency of gaining useful, reliable knowledge. That efficiency comes partly from reliable knowledge acquisition and that is mostly by reducing the negative impact of biases and thinking mistakes. In other words, well chosen methods reduce the extent to which what we think is true is undermined or &#39;reliant on&#39; our wishes and preconceptions.

 You make a good point about how our internal feelings helps us decide which facts we want to accept. But now I am going to play devils advocate here.

Now please explain to me how your feelings are going to change this fact. <br><br>It is true that our feelings influence how and what we think of as facts, but there is still some truth to what they say. It is just that our internal misconceptions make us blind to those truths, truths that can be found on either side or maybe even none. To say anything else is simply overreaching. Some facts are unavoidably true, but neither left nor right can really claim to have that, since you will not easyly find those in either politics or the news.<br><br>It&#39;s simply too unlikely to stumble over true diamonds in the middle of a mud fight.

 Sort of what im thinking but at the same time u seem like ur equating math with science when deductive math/logic are always right if u assume the realities/premises used, for example 2+3=5; there might not be a 2 or 3 but if there is a 2 and a 3 that means adding them together would be 5, as long as adding is increasing by such on a number line and 5 is 2 after 3 and 3 after 2. This ties together with the vid bc as long as the stats arent incorrect theyre objective measurements; if u presuppose the person/group responsible for the data collection arent telling a lie and you presuppose there is no error with any other technicalities the data is correct; the data might not accurately portray what u want it to, but the context of the data is true unless u wanna turn around and say reality isnt real. <br><br>Also the simplified version of this vid is just to interpret stats the best way u can. And 1 more thing, with the iq testing thats a totally different topic but yes theyve been historically unfair although that doesnt completely invalidate the concept of the g-factor.

But the model isn&#39;t the objective truth, nor is this point even a good point to make because its a model about locations of crimes apprehended, it&#39;ll be more skewed than a model of locations of crimes reported for obvious reasons but runs with that saying that because this model is incorrect via specifically feedback loop, that therefore all models are incorrect.

 Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings. But they also don&#39;t care about my feelings. I however, do care about my feeling, so when I share facts, I do it in a way that makes me feel like I&#39;m right. And I think that for majority it is the same, and even when someone says they don&#39;t care about theirs, then they&#39;re probably someone who wants to be respected as a human and when they find out something on their own, they&#39;ll want that to be recognized. Because they didn&#39;t care about their feeling during research. Getting told you&#39;re wrong after losing a part of yourself can be saving or condemning, depending on details.<br><br>On top of that, humans perceive the whole world differently already depending on language. The way you talk gives you a different perspective on how the world works, every time you learn a new language you learn a new way to see the world. There are languages that are build in a way where nothing is doing things, everything is in a state at all times (eg the stone doesn&#39;t fall, it stones down etc), while some don&#39;t have grammar and you have to understand based on context (like chinese or japanese), so on and so on. So that&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re influenced by, but that&#39;s fine because everyone is? And categories and language came after humans, and humans came after the conditions of the world. So I don&#39;t think anyone will ever truly see what it actually is without judgment because even &#39;facts&#39; are something man made. Which isn&#39;t inteded to be condemning, because every way to perceive is and that&#39;s okay. <br>In my opinion, at least^^

 A great analogy for drawing the wrong conclusions from a good data set is one where in WW2 they studied the bombers that came back from bombing raids to see where they had been damaged by enemy defenders and the intention was that the most commonly damaged areas they would beef up with armor to protect the crew and plane.  It wasn&#39;t until someone pointed out that they need to do the opposite, that the areas where planes that came back weren&#39;t damaged was where they needed to add armor because obviously the planes could survive damage to the other areas and the planes that WERE hit in the areas that didn&#39;t show up commonly did not make it back.  Facts matter, even more important is how we interpret them.

 Wait, but Ben will often say the same things.

 Hi Zoe, or anyone for that matter who&#39;s willing to talk about it, I&#39;m quite new to the channel so please forgive me if I miss some things. I believe that what you&#39;re saying, especially at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=19m27s">19:27</a> is something I can wholeheartedly agree with, because I believe that facts <b>don&#39;t</b> care about anyone&#39;s feelings and people should accept that, whilst knowing that they&#39;re biased, which is where we get debates where people with one set of biases can come to agreements, disagreements and terms with people with other sets of biases to arrive at reality. And therefore, although I agree with your closing statement and overall most things you&#39;ve outlined, I don&#39;t believe they work in the context set up by the title of the video and the overarching point of disproving the statement that &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t seem to be convinced that the problems which you&#39;ve described apply to the word fact, which could be how I understand the word &quot;fact&quot;. I see fact as being an objective truth, not data, which I see as a separate thing mainly because there are biases within data, originating from a variety of things, for instance it being the choice of the data sample. The assumptions made by the PredPol engine, in my opinion, are more similar to an inference than a fact, as it is not a proven law of reality, but a set of scientific guesses created on top of data, which as you correctly pointed out, may be bad or good data. Similar to Google vanishing houses, Google Maps is a private entity that shows images, a lot of the times outdated, of environment, which also is constantly reshaped by people&#39;s actions and changes to our planet. Not even mentioning that the borders they show aren&#39;t facts either, they don&#39;t exist in reality and they aren&#39;t even agreed upon by all countries. Appearance of an object is only a fact as long as the appearance is current. The problems you&#39;ve been describing have been much more to do with data and inference, rather than actual facts, in my opinion. <br><br>So, in essence, in the context of how the video is set up, it feels a bit dishonest. Of course, I don&#39;t mean to imply that you are dishonest, I don&#39;t think you have had any terrible intentions behind this video, but talking about how things that aren&#39;t facts can be altered by feelings in response to a statement that says that &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; seems to present a counter point, even though it doesn&#39;t. If Ben Shapiro uses the statement to support an inference or a set of data that aren&#39;t cold cut facts, that&#39;s totally on him and it&#39;s his fault for misusing that statement. I am not a huge fan of Ben, as I outlined I&#39;ve just gotten to know Zoe Bee, but although I believe you&#39;re right on the conclusion and your evidence, I do feel the point of &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings is wrong&quot; comes off as dishonest.<br><br>Of course, this could be differences in how we see the word fact as I said before, or differences in how we see that statement, or any other reason, but I just wanted to express my thoughts on this video. Apart from that, the presentation and explanations are really compelling and your video as a product is a well put together piece of media. Also, my bad if I&#39;m terrible at explaining things, political arguments are quite daunting for me, but I&#39;m willing to correct myself.

 I agree with everything you&#39;re saying. The only problem I have is that Ben does not mention IQ when talking about race or gender. And there are difference in men and women. It&#39;s shown that men and women on average have the same IQ, but men end up on the extremes of IQ and women tend to show a normal model curve. Please don&#39;t sully a good argument by trying to fight against an argument ben never makes.

 When ben says dumb things just because he says there facts don‚Äôt mean there facts, facts are facts weather we get different results in out head when viewing them, you will never observe objective reality but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can not obtain objective facts, i don‚Äôt support Shapiro at all but facts will still not care about your feelings. For example in your poor neighborhood example because there is more crime  poor neighborhood we send more police. Makes sense it is an objective fact that there is more crime‚Ä¶ however other objective facts do rely on each other for example there is more crime but maybe because the state has bad laws or because there poor or there are drug problems maybe even because of the police, so then when we eventually come to a conclusion on why the crime is there the fact looks like this. There is more crime in poor neighborhoods because of harsh police enforcement, or something or other. You could say that facts care about our feeling buts its more rely as do facts rely on everything so it is not different.

 Jordan Peterson isn&#39;t a dark web intellectual, he is a psychologist from Canada. TBH I&#39;m not sure if Ben Shapiro is a technical &quot;Dark Web&quot; intellectual either, but I&#39;m also not sure if you know that too and were using the term in jest. What I am largely less unsure about is that Ben Shapiro definitely can be a turd burglar who expresses his emotionally charged self righteous ideological beliefs with little to no discernment of or consideration for others. Jordan isn&#39;t like Ben, he&#39;s a really sensitive, understanding and loving guy who believes in truth and love. Almost half of bitter people dislike the idea of truth, half dislike the idea of love, essentially a lot of people going through bruh moments don&#39;t like him because they get hung up with a microcosmic perspective on things he says within macrocosmic context. Jordan is very progressive and it does him and what he stands for a disservice to lump him in with political tools like Ben. Other than that, I like your points. This is the kind of philosophical take on our relationship to knowledge and understanding I wish more people understood. I believe understanding language is the key to understanding people. Regardless of how disconnected we are from our language roots, if people take the time to study the etymology of the words we use, we can pave the way to understanding the reality that they symbolize.

Jordan is a psychologist, he studies human nature, and tries to communicate what he understands about it in a way that helps people help themselves. Ben is a political commentator, he understands and believes in different things, with a considerably lower amount of conscientiousness and tact. I kind of think he enjoys pissing people off, lol. TBF, I&#39;m not sure Ben even understands or cares about the deep downs of what Jordan studies. He seems all too cared about his public image and painting a picture.

 Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but you&#39;re argumenting that because of how the human brain is built, you cannot be 100% objective and you are always going to have that bit of subjectivity in your findings. <br>While that&#39;s true (except for lizard people haha), &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; ( at least to me ) is not an opposition to that rule, but more of a critique to those who don&#39;t try to be objective. There is people who try their best to remove subjectivity ( even if not at 100% ), and there is people who refuse to listen to different opinions, and only &quot;want to feel&quot; right.<br>As somewhat of a fan of Ben Shapiro, the latter is present everywhere ( I still remember when he said &quot;rap&quot; wasn&#39;t music ... ), even i might do it sometimes without noticing, but i always try to listen to the other side ... so here i am :)

Most of the time when people are arguing over and people are making arguments they are simply using the fact and the statistics. Agree with their point so even though the numbers don&#39;t lie how we interpret them is just as important as the numbers themselves. In the example about the police models the output that the models make is completely dependent on the input that they&#39;re given so if they&#39;re given biased input they&#39;re going to give biased outfits so to take these outputs as a fact ultimately is going to be very harmful.

 I don&#39;t quite understand your point, or what point your trying to make, on the topic of models predicting low socio-economic areas to be hotspots for crime. Because in my experience this is exactly the case, and the only way to deal with that, or at least the most apparent to me is to send police officers to that area. yet to me it seems like you are condemning this, the fact that model is predicting low socio-economic areas for high rates of crime is only a correlation that we have observed not the cause, although I definitely think it is.<br><br>Personally I live and have lived all my life in a low socio-economic area and know people who have been stabbed robbed and killed, and I&#39;ve been jumped by a gang myself, and quite recently a classmate of mine died due to an opposing gang having issue with a comment he made. After he was killed a day later a gang war was supposed to start, yet it was stopped because there was finally proper police presence and the war never broke out. <br><br>I say all this to reiterate that I don&#39;t see what your point is. These models work and have saved lives, I had a friend who was going to get robbed yet when he turned the corner there police cars there just patrolling and thanks to the models that sent them there,my friend is now safer because of it. <br><br>So basically I&#39;m just confused with your point.

For example: where is crime most heavily coorelared with poor mental health? Would sending trained councilors be just as effective as sending in bunch of cops to add MORE guns to the area? <br>Policing has its purpose...but when all you use is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. And if the only tool you use to keep order is a cop, everything starts to look like a crime. The fact that being HOMELESS is a crime should tell you that.']

 No, sorry I disagree, I find your video title misleading and your conclusion wrong. Facts are facts, feelings and opinions are not facts. The number 1 is the number 1, if you come to a conclusion that the number 1 is the best number, that&#39;s not a fact, that&#39;s an opinion. If Ben Shapiro comes to the conclusion that some races/sexes are less intelligent than others, that&#39;s an opinion not a fact. His feelings did not change the facts. The facts are the hard numbers in the study that he got the info from, as well as the process used to get the data by the study. The entire video, you are basically talking about how people interpret data, not that data is changed by feelings. The reality is, and people have always realized it, that data can be interpreted many ways, and your feelings have a role in that. Raw IQ numbers don&#39;t inherently show intelligence, they simply show what somebody got on an IQ test. The conclusion that IQ is a representation for intelligence is actually an opinion, a feeling, a belief.

She&#39;s getting confused about what facts are, and what conclusions are. Maybe I could come up with a better example, I just felt that using the number 1 as such a basic fact got to the point. Actually, let&#39;s say 2+2=4. That&#39;s a fact, right? Now, no amount of feelings that 2+2=5 will ever change the fact that 2+2=4.

 The thing about the scientific method is that review is a very important part, people try to bare in mind their own biases when making a scientific paper and peer review helps that stay in check. If they don&#39;t and the paper has possible fallacies, then other people will criticize that paper with a possible paper of their own. I feel like your examples don&#39;t keep this in mind, for example the police one, you yourself give criticism to that system which in turn people making that system will keep into account which will then modify the system. The arguments at the start are something everyone has, everyone works with the info they have and highlight what they find the most important part to be. The finishing quote I also find a bit weird as an argument, as yes the interpretation of the statistics can be flawed, it&#39;s not fact.

 I recall a study or something that Jordan Peterson brought up in one of his lectures (of which I had seen a few) that states that, in contrast to alleged assertions of conservatives being more neurotic, it is actually liberals who tend to score higher in neuroticism. While this was meant to counter the idea that conservatives are &quot;afraid&quot; or something, I found that such a data conclusion, IF TRUE, would make sense in the light it bares on the this great political divide---namely, that conservatives may generally feel little issue with the way things are, while liberals are more prone to detect problems and injustices and thus want to see change/reform. If the two sides can learn to actually understand one another and land on the same page, maybe we can get somewhere (rather than progressively drift apart).

Perhaps intelligence is reflected in your ability to have the patience and fortitude to study hour upon hour for such a test -- but that again usually comes down to having the time and ability to engage in such an enterprise, having the financial capacity to do so, or even having access to &quot;study drugs.&quot; IQ tests don&#39;t provide anything meaningful, that is how I feel about that fact/feeling.<br><br>Ben Shapiro is mostly an entertainer, slightly less obnoxious than Coulter or Limbaugh.

 this is what is called muddying the waters. Zoe Bee never debunks here any factual statements, she just claims that our data is incomplete to make some conclusions and then muddies the water on all of the facts claiming that everything we do is based on feelings, and from that point on, basically, claim anything you want because feelings.<br>guess what, claiming that data is incomplete is a factual statement, proven fact that doesn‚Äôt care about anybody‚Äôs feelings, but it in no means is a copout for ignoring the numbers and arguing stuff based on them. Additionally, even in her example of crime statistics mapping out poverty, which is a fact, what is also a fact is that crime rate dropped by 23%, which means that model is contributing to reducing the crime, which is a good thing. Yes, there is more police in poorer neighborhoods making them suffer more for petty crimes, but also, stronger police presence allows people to start building up wealth, which is not the case when there is no police. So rather then arguing on the  grounds of ‚Äúwe are criminalizing poverty, lets remove data driven approach‚Äù we should be focusing on improving our data. And that is the only part where Zoe Bee‚Äôs arguments make sense, you should be aware that you have some biases that make you more likely to miss some data points and not the others, that‚Äôs when you bring up a FACT that doesn‚Äôt care about someone‚Äôs feelings and prove to them that they are missing something.

A better analysis would consider the facts of burglary in 2000 all the way up to 2013, alongside environmental factors per year. Whether these environmental factors apply is up for analysis.

 I am late to this but you just talked about how the data is interpreted so the facts are bound by our biases and how this leads to harm but as you than later stated they are not objective as they do not eliminate there biases from the equation perfect objective facts in truth do not care about feelings but than at the end you also said that our biases are good as they allow us to interpret data so what is.

 Nothing from what you said suggest that fact cares about feeling. It&#39;s the opposite, you&#39;re saying human are fallible therefore they struggle to find true objective fact which is simply true but it does not in any way suggest that true &quot;objective fact&quot; (if it ever exist at least in social context) actually gives a damn about feelings.<br><br>Not to mention when it comes to social science, even if something is a fact doesn&#39;t means it&#39;s always better for dozens of reason. but again this doesn&#39;t means that any social fact gives a shit about feelings. You might even argue that fact in social world is malleable therefore what considered fact today may not be so one day which is a true sentiment. But that simply means that the whole foundation of &quot;Social science&quot; is shaky, something that ALL social scientist worth their salt will agree<br><br>However this video is very dishonest. Highlighting the so called intellectual dark web for being biased is fine but you forgot that the whole issue you raised in this video are done 100 times worse by people that these rationalist oppose of. Ben Shapiro biased POV are simply better than some dishonest charlatan who just say whatever they want to get what they want.

 The whole commentary about &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is not that your feelings cannot be informed by factual information, but it is more a hard cut appeal to objectivity over relativity. And that as a plain statement, is false because it can be taken many ways and there are many contexts behind it which could call it into question. For instance, when Ben is talking about &#39;feelings&#39; he is talking about emotions and the baggage there-in. <br><br>There is of course, bias in data, depending on who is the one coming up with the framing and what is being represented and what factors are being left out...it is all very complex. That is why &#39;facts&#39; don&#39;t care about your feelings. Raw data doesn&#39;t care what your biases are, it is just raw data, and that is why we are being told by Ben that it doesn&#39;t care about our feelings. Because sure I can look at statistics and see a particular ratio of numbers and get angry about it...<br><br>Yes, certain inputs beget certain outputs, that is very true and that is a good argument. However assigning a &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;good&#39; value to that output is once again, subjective. This is why it brings in the &quot;Doesn&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; part. If your objective is to combat crime, then you plug in the data where most crime happens and you police that area, and crime goes down. That is a positive thing. <br><br>Then you can look at the data as well and see &quot;Hey, this seems to target low-income, and minority majority areas&quot; and then here comes the tricky bit...This is where the &#39;facts&#39; collide with &#39;feeling&#39;. On one hand, you have the &#39;fact&#39; part, where low-income and minority majority areas are higher in crimes...and yes it includes &#39;non violent&#39; offenses...so you can objectively filter those. Go back to the data and say &#39;hey lets re-focus, we want to stop crime, but we also don&#39;t want excess policing in these areas, so lets exclude non-violent crimes from our database&#39; and that is perfectly rational, a fair assessment of your policing procedures and not emotionally charged or subjective.<br><br>The &#39;feeling&#39; stance, is getting angry about it, or throwing out accusations of racism or classism because the algorithm is accurately stating where the crime is happening. So you accuse the police in general of being racist or anti-poor and call for the abolition of the system as a whole, or defunding that particular program because of a short-sighted emotional response to your particular interpretation of how you perceive things to be. <br><br>Yes even white supremacists could see this data and feel &#39;vindicated&#39; because it would show &#39;minorities commit more crime&#39; while they ignore the white-crime that is also happening in these areas and more rural towns. Especially if you include the non-violent offenses, which would remarkably inflate the numbers on both sides of the divide because most crime is non-violent and usually committed by the majority. This too is an emotional read of the data, which would add unfair biases and readings that could lead to interpretation that is factually incorrect. <br><br>That is the exact reason why there is a call for facts NOT to care about your feelings, because both of the &#39;feeling&#39; instances in this case, would lead to damaging repercussions if we were to just start yanking at the strings to get an outcome we particularly desired. In this particular case, it would lead to under-policing if the people saying that it was racist/classist to police these areas because of the makeup of the population and pulling back police presence...or Over-policing if the supremacists got their read of the data taken as truth, and wanted to increase police presence specifically in minority neighborhoods simply because of their racial makeup.

You said that the purpose of their feelings (lol) behind believing rationality was the best way to go about [politics? I dunno what they use the phrase for] is because it was the best way to help humans &quot;prosper&quot;. A good portion of these dark web intellectuals, as you call em,  believe in rationality because they find it morally superior to other methods of decision-making, and prospering is just a nice side effect.

 Reality is objective and no matter how humans want to interpet it it will never change, modern twitter philosopers will argue that subjectivity is existent in every human but it&#39;s not. And the way we can be sure of being objective is by carefully analizing statistics (not studies, but actual numbers, because numbers cannot actually be that easily falsified, yet &quot;cientific studies&quot; can) and using logic to deduct what will come of and what created a situation.<br><br>So yeah, facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, sorry tumblr poet.

 Yeah, when you start measuring public policies by whether they adversely affect one group more than another and not whether the BEHAVIOR (average) might be different between the two groups, then we&#39;ve went off the deep end. For instance in high crime communities the question should always be &quot; WHY are these people acting this way and how can we reduce or eliminate this issue from this population or area?&quot; and not &quot;Are we arresting people too much compared to other groups in this area?&quot; &quot;Equality before the law&quot; doesn&#39;t mean equal outcomes for your group. It merely means you get the same rights as everyone else. So I see this video is already off the deep end, so I won&#39;t be finishing it , after all and I&#39;ll give you a good thumbs down. Just because you don&#39;t like what the data says doesn&#39;t mean the data or the policies that flow from the data are wrong, or even self-reinforcing despite the bullcrap in the alleged math book you quote several times. Basically, cops aren&#39;t looking for MORE crimes in minority  and poor communities: they are looking for less. So the success of the data model and the way they respond to it is measured by the numbers GOING DOWN not going up, hence your whole critique is ridiculous. And the numbers were going down for several years. They eventually reached lows we hadn&#39;t seen for decades here in Baltimore. Then Freddy Gray, policy changes immediately implemented (and even more on the way due to the Fed government though that took a few years) and BOOM! the very next year murders shot way up and they&#39;ve remained way up EVERY YEAR SINCE. But hey, if your only concern is &quot;Proportional Policing&quot; then I guess this is a HUGE SUCCESS.

From, in my city of Baltimore like 300 plus murders a year to the low 200&#39;s or even the high 100&#39;s.

 I can&#39;t see this video convincing Ben Shapiro fans, because it contains assumptions they don&#39;t share in it&#39;s core example.<br><br>Police may be zeroing in on poor neighbourhoods, but a Ben fan would just argue that this is where they ought to be be. After all, more crime is taking place there. Sending the police elsewhere would just allow the petty criminals now being arrested to get away with it.<br>Unless you assume that the presence of the police is in itself a destructive influence and unless you believe that we achieve better outcomes by not enforcing laws against petty crimes like drug use, you won&#39;t see anything wrong with these policing algorithms.<br>After all, a Ben fan would argue, even in the ghetto, you won&#39;t be bothered by the police if you aren&#39;t committing crimes. So by making the free choice to just not do so, you are safe. And if you refuse to make that choice, then you deserve to be hunted by the police.<br><br>Given that Ben and his fans deny systemic racism and police misconduct, you can&#39;t convince them like this. Just like you described that the same article can have people walking away with two different conclusions, so does your video have this effect. Ben fans who actually watch this will be reaffirmed in their belief that leftists seek to stop the police from enforcing the law in their plan to make America into a lawless hellhole, and that only cracking down harder can stop them.

 When you confuse ‚Äúsources‚Äù with ‚Äúfacts‚Äù you get videos like this. It‚Äôs not the fact that a statistician found some data that something is true, it‚Äôs about how they came to find that data and whether or not we know that method is reliable that determines whether or not something is true. When Ben Shapiro says ‚ÄúFacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù he means what he is clearly saying, that how you feel has no affect on how the world objectively functions, regardless of whether or not we fully understand that function yet.

 This is why the &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; thing is so harmful; no, true, objective facts are unaffected by any individuals feelings. However, as humans, gaining a true, objective fact is near impossible, their are so many different biases and reference frames that drastically distort our perception. Because of this, claiming &quot;facts&quot; to justify something like taking away young children&#39;s right to gender affirming healthcare is flawed, and as proven by many more studies that are proven to be more accurate, harmful.

 The whole point of keeping emotions out of the equation is so that you can input good data to get a good output. What you are describing is bad data claimed as facts due to irrationality of emotions. So in fields of study that are seeking real facts, there is a listening of ideas to see which ideas fit a solution and which ones don&#39;t and why. When it comes to politics, this does not occur, where evidence and reasoning is ignored by the irrational party. Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings is absolutely true, what you are questioning is whether actual facts have been presented, which is why &quot;rational&quot; discussions need to be put forward to test supposed facts for legitimacy. Irrationality is the way you want things to be compared to the reality of how they really are. You can irrationally believe that if you flap your arms everyday, one day you will be able to fly, or you can look at the reality of the situation to make real progress in human flight (based on real facts). That said, we are all emotional beings where emotions I would say is far more important than intellect considering our emotions is what will drive our motivation in life. What good is an intellect if you don&#39;t desire to get out of bed ever.

 Science doesn&#39;t say anything, scientists do. <br><br>I would argue that objective reality (facts, truth, etc.) don&#39;t depend on your feelings but interpretations are very much subject to bias and feelings. This doesn&#39;t mean the data they collected is complete enough to arrive at a reasonable conclusion though. For example, when designing computer architecture, or even just programming a microchip, we have to use logic. One of the principles of logic states that if any part of the input is false (&#39;doesn&#39;t meet the condition&#39;), the entire output is false. Similarly, you mentioned correlating crime to poor neighborhoods, and poor neighborhoods have denser populations of minorities, therefore minorities cause more crime. The logic to come to this conclusion is fine but the initial conditions are only partly true, and therefore everything is incorrect from the beginning. So, in order to truly come to an absolute conclusion you have to either; <br><br>A. Consider every possible bit of information (which would easily branch out too far to be done in a reasonable time if at all), or<br>B. Conduct something similar to an error analysis in which we create a correlation factor telling us how accurate the conclusion is.<br><br>The second case is actually almost useless when it comes to logical proofs because it doesn&#39;t give an objective answer. Say we gathered nearly everything that could possibly effect our situation and our correlation was 0.999999 or higher, we still need to jump the left over gap. Now I understand that society is not as neat a tidy as mathematics, so a single contradiction may not change everything. It seems that it is impossible to have objective conclusions and meaning in and about society without an objective absolute reference point to keep our opinions from swaying our interpretations. Therefore objective truth does not change based on people&#39;s changing feelings but what we think it means does. Claiming that your conclusion or partial information is fact and therefore absolute, is not correct. <br><br><br>I use this example for my little brother who often thinks with his feelings. (I made it up and it may not be perfect). <br>&quot;Light is complicated but let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a wave. Color is certain light wavelengths that are reflected off objects. Say you look at grass and it looks green. You are seeing light with a wavelength of about 540nm (nanometers), more or less, bouncing of the grass and hitting your eyes. Now say someone who is color blind looks at grass and says it&#39;s the same color as the brown dirt, the blue sky, or whatever else. The light wavelength they are seeing from the grass is still the same wavelength (540nm) but they are receiving it differently. The objective truth is that the grass is &#39;green&#39; regardless of how you see it. The whole point of language is to assign words to objective things and stuff so that we don&#39;t have to call them things and stuff. The fact is that you are both experiencing the same objective thing regardless of what you call it. The wavelength doesn&#39;t change because you like or dislike the color.&quot; -Me 2020<br><br>I don&#39;t study social science so this is just my two cents. <br>Also I think it&#39;s neat that words are like pointers and when we use them we are just dereferencing them.

 Moreso it depends on what you define the facts to be. Do certain races score higher on IQ tests? They objectively do, but does that mean certain races are more intelligent than others? No, as there are many many other factors to consider what is causing those results (social, economic, etc.) And do you believe that IQ tests are an accurate measure of what you value to be intelligence. The argument from crime statistics, again, easily manipulated to mean different things, but in the end its still a fact, in your example, the fact of poorer neighbourhoods having more crime is<br><br>a) flawed data<br>and <br>b) not offering enough information<br><br>So they&#39;re not really valuable facts<br><br>That said, I think Ben Shapiro is talking about trans issues when he does the whole &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot;. In which case I&#39;d have to agree, factually an XY chromosome is male and XX is female. People may &quot;feel&quot; like they are the opposite sex (despite not ever lived like that gender or having any idea what the experience of that gender is), but that does not mean they are. The factual definition of the world male and female does not fit what they claim to be.<br><br>So now, of course we can do what many people are doing now and simply change the meaning of the world male and female. Make male mean how you feel (if you decide to associate gender tropes to people). But then you still need to allocate a word for someone who is physically born with a penis, or born with a vagina. In the end you&#39;re using your feelings to manipulate words to justify your condition, and lie to yourself that you&#39;re the same as someone born with different genitalia. It doesn&#39;t change the &quot;fact&quot; that your body doesn&#39;t align with what gender you think you are.<br><br>factually, male means you were born with XY chromosomes. And feelings can&#39;t change that. It isn&#39;t a statistic you can manipulate, its a hard fact that some people have XY chromosomes, and some have XX (and there&#39;s the outlier with triple chromosomes). Your feelings cannot change what genes you have. 

 	Replies: ['Salman Hannan', '@Amaris B by saying gender is a social construct, by thinking &quot;despite having a penis I like feminine things, hence 8 must actually be a girl&quot; automatically stereotypes traits to be locked to certain genders, which in itself is sort of sexist. Males do not know what it is like to be female, because they are not treated like women, they do not have the biological and chemical things that affect their behaviours and lifestyle, so in the end they are assuming they are women simply due to abstract social stereotypes of what it means to be a women. Which is a little sexist and somewhat shallow. Gender is a social construct is a nice buzz phrase but in the end its just a result of people change the meaning of thd word gender. If we agree that xy and xx are two different things. We need to admit thst no matter how much you feel like an xx, you&#39;ll still be an xy. We make things simple by calling an xx a female and an xy a male. Any sort of &quot;I like dresses hence I am female&quot; is a shallow social construct which denies the truth of your gender. In the end its a mental disorder, and people need to accept that, not redefine words to make it seem like it&#39;s perfectly normal. Trans folk are fine people and don&#39;t deserve discrimination, but to deconstruct everything we accept about gender to accommodate for their delusions is unhealthy. Why is it OK to call gender a social construct but not other biological visual identifiers like race and ethnicity then? Why can I not identify as black? Very few people look like how they would ideally want to look like. We will judge women for plastic surgery but champion genital mutilation...

It&#39;s better to say &quot;OK, i factually have vagina, my body is swimming in oestrogen, these make me different from men because they affect how I live my life, i will use these traits to identify myself as female&quot;', 'Amaris B', 'i disagree with you. i mean, on the whole gender and sex thing- youre right, feelings cant change what genes you have but that isnt what being transgender is. no transgender person, at least none that ive ever come across, are trying to &#39;change their genes&#39;, just change their physical appearance to be in line with how they view themselves, gender-wise. sex is biological, but gender is a social construct. they both cross over each other and intertwine a lot, but they are different things. i think that most trans people know that their &quot;feelings&quot; arent going to change their genes- but when someone who is born biologically male and they feel  they fit the role of a woman, or identify with it better, they are most likely going to attempt to look the part, act the part, dress the part. because its who they are. i dont like to think that who i am, my experiences and the spirit i was born with to come down to genes. and neither would any trans person. because the human experience is so much more than biology.']

 Crime statistics don&#39;t take into account how much people in certain neighbourhoods have to alter their lives to avoid being victims of crime. These crimes that don&#39;t occur, when people are menaced hand over there money and don&#39;t bother reporting it, so don&#39;t go out at night any more etc. As you say, numbers tend to tell you what you know not what you don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t understand. So if the economy is up or down is a dumb statement, it should be what businesses are doing well, what are doing badly, what are dinosaurs that need to go, what are trailblazers that deserve investment, not a blanket statement for the entire economy which means next to nothing.

 I think that Cathy O‚ÄôNeils quote, ‚Äúthe result is that we criminalize poverty‚Äù is incorrect. Poverty is not criminalized. Crime is criminalized. While true that the model will unequally report crimes in high-crime areas, it is not because the area is poor or largely populated by minorities, but because more crimes occurred there. The crime occurrences is the driving force of that model, not anything else. <br>Poverty-stricken people are more likely to commit crimes due to the harsh conditions that they live in, but being poor is not a reason to allow that person to commit a crime. Everyone in society is held to the same standard that we call Laws. (Whether the laws are written properly is an entirely separate and massive conversation). <br>The reason that the model marked that ghetto as a high-crime area in the first place, is because of its high-crime rate, not because of any other factor. <br>Also, what is an alternative to focusing on a high-crime area? Not police the area in an effort to artificially reduce the crime rate of the ghetto? That just means we‚Äôd be abandoning those people who are being victimized by the criminals. Just because the area has most of the police in it, doesn‚Äôt mean that other areas aren‚Äôt parked as well. Also, wouldn‚Äôt increase police presence promote a reduction in crime, since the criminals would be more likely to be caught, so they‚Äôd either commit fewer crimes, or go to areas that have a smaller police presence? The act of increasing police presence could actually help that area reduce its crime rate, thereby updating the model to have better data.

What you do with the facts is what is influenced by your feelings, which is what you argue in your video.<br><br>So your whole arguments is going into the direction of: behaviour is influenced by feelings.

 Can I say this is a good video. But this essentially comes around to say, even you pointed out otherwise, objectivity is not possible and everything is under bias. Which is not wrong but you are just disregarding peer review process. This is limited, correct but almost every impactful research has many opposition articles written about them. All of these individually are subjective but collectivelly it paints the most realistic picture. Maybe your aim was not to push your point just by appealing to authority of certain writers but still I must stress scientific method is not to be simplified into just &#39;everything must have a bias&#39;. If you are sincere about your concern you must push for education regarding understanding scientific literature en masse. When a research article is immensly offensive yes, it is a good chance of being biased but it has, admittedly in small part, has a chance to change scientific status quo as a whole. Relativity did this before newtonian physics did it, in psychology mechanisims of unaware mind did it, seperation of labour did it for economics, even IQ tests as controversial they might be show there can be schemes to measure intellectual ability in limited contexts which sounds unimportant but it really is as stamdart tests are very clearly a good solution for academic evaluation. This is why science is idealised because by nature it is the most open subjective discussion one can have with another one, by design every single process is presented and opinions can be tested again and again and it only takes a small hiccup for an hypothesis to fall into irrelevancy. I understand your point, but I am dissapointed about lack of stress you put regarding scientific process and peer review.

 Humans&#39; general inability to correctly handle facts is no reason for saying that facts are not objective and not independent of our feelings.<br>For example, the whole crime prediction thing was just bad modeling. The fact that certain crimes happen more in certain areas are objectively there, but the model they used did not compensate for sampling bias (if the facts were correctly presented in this video), which is a stupid thing that even alone leads to that vicious cycle, and apparently it also did not really differentiate between levels of seriousness of crimes, which alone would have made the whole thing unjust and is an artifact of a wrong objective that was input. The police had the objective that they wanted in the end to write down a bigger number of crimes they dealt which, when their actual objective should be to make the city safer. If the objective facts facts had been modeled correctly and used to achieve the correct objective, it would have been a good thing. And it probably still would have lead to more policing in certain neighborhoods, and people being angry that their neighborhood is policed more, but that would have been justified and not the result of a vicious cycle fueled by human biases.<br>When Ben Shapiro says &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot;, I assume he agrees that this means that we should work past our biases and strive to correctly asses the facts. Whenever we catch him failing to do that, we should hold him accountable for it. But it doesn&#39;t mean his motto is wrong, just because he sometimes fails to live up to it. If he does it too often though, or denies that he may be biased too, he&#39;s a hypocrite who just uses this motto to dress up his opinions as synonymous with facts. Which still doesn&#39;t make it wrong, just abused.

 I just have one thing to sort of pick up on about the video, Zoe. You said that the climate is not changing due to human intervention. Well, I&#39;d recommend reaching for credible resources. There is an evidence for that burning carbon fuel causes warming of a climate. It is measurable. And no, I&#39;m not defending these activists who are just led by emotions and not by reason but if we are to talk about the facts, then that&#39;s the way things are. In such a case, those peope who try to claim it is not because of humans that the climate change are the obscurantists trying to turn the eyes away from the problem to let them go on with agenda of big corporations who, in the name of profit, do not care about the ecosystem or life on the planet.

 You had me until you got to the crime prediction. With sources such as &quot;criminalizing poverty&quot; which is a clear violation of good faith discussion in regards to the efficacy of such programs. The entire point of such a program is to lower the total crime rate of a city and in the same source you cite that the crime rate was lowered. So by simply stating that the program discriminates towards poor neighborhoods is not criminalizing the poor but simply reflective of a correlation between poor areas and crime rates. If the enforcement of these areas is a bad thing then that is what you need to address. Not the program for  correctly identifying a crime rate or the police department for wanting to protect those areas from crime.<br>Make no mistake, I believe Ben Shapiro is acting in bad faith when he presents so  called &#39;facts&#39;. Yet, I feel the approach you took and analyzing this policing was done in much the same way.

 This whole video seems to be based on the assumption that there is such a thing as good data and bad data. Data is just data. And maybe there&#39;s something to the data, that has nothing to do with judgement. Honestly, the thing that&#39;s happening on the left has to do with too much feelings, and it&#39;s important to tone them down to understand the reasonable views presented in the beginning of this video. However, I do have to agree that basing decisions on just logic is also not wise. It&#39;s not that facts care or don&#39;t care about your feelings, it&#39;s more you care too much and the other side doesn&#39;t care enough. Fact are just facts, just how data is just data.

 I think the biggest issue here isn&#39;t that we&#39;re using mathematic models in a haphazardly clinical trial-esque setting to come to conclusions about-for example as you said- North American law enforcement target zones, it&#39;s WAYYYY deeper than that.<br>Factually we know mental illness is the main cause for any and all crime. <br>Being mentally ill doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to commit a crime, but mentally healthy people who have seen no trauma who have help available to them statically don&#39;t commonly get into any intentional trouble that proper education of societal expectations can&#39;t help us avoid.<br>But because people don&#39;t want to admit that our pride is what stops us from treating mental illness as anything but an &quot;other&quot; label we can&#39;t fix the problem.

 I strongly agree with many of these points as a former researcher myself. Its part of the reason I left academia as the &quot;publish or perish&quot; and constant race for grant money that required results just wasn&#39;t for me. I do take issue with the premise that &quot;facts&quot; care about our feelings. What we perceive and choose to portray as fact for sure and that&#39;s a huge problem but the real truth itself not so much. That being said we are primates with brains evolved for pattern recognition, not complex sociology or cosmology so we most definitely have biases and incomplete models. The policing models are a prime example of this but I would argue have no bearing on true facts. I am of the personal belief that we should rely on meta-analysis and need more journals willing to publish unsuccessful experimental results because these are just as important to science as the experiments that lead to pop science headlines. Perhaps it would also work to show the public that scientists are not arrogant and believe themselves to be infallible but often find out new things by being wrong all the time.

 It is absolutely laughable to think that con-artists like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson are champions of reason and rationality.

Jordan Peterson is another con-man who uses rhetorical absurdities and purposeful obfuscation to peddle infantile pseudo-science and mystical mumbo-jumbo.

 I was right with you up until the last phase. You criticize dark web intellectuals and their listeners with too broad a brush. Thinkers like Shapiro and Peterson are putting many theses out into the aether, and each needs to be evaluated on it&#39;s own merit. Some theses are sound arguments based on quality data and strong premises. Some are over-simplistic analyses of good data, some are based on incomplete data or data gathered in a less-than-robust fashion, some is erudite speculation, some have features of all of the above. Knowing the lie of pure objectivity is an invaluable tool in the process of evaluating these theses, yes. However, making a blanket statement that their respective audiences believes the lie of pure objectivity is itself a generalization. Making a blanket statement that their arguments lack any objective facts (robustly gathered data) is another generalization.

 Generally agree with what you said. What I disagree with a few implied things. Like that catchphrase is what the intellectual darkweb believes. It&#39;s just a short saying to hint at the point someone wants to make. The people I listen to are aware that bias exists both in data as well as the selection of data. <br>And another thing which you don&#39;t really say but imply is that the message of the people of the intellectual darkweb is generally wrong. I disagree there. It is certainly biased and has its blind spots, but there are plenty of statements they make which are correct. Like over 90% of the prison population comes from fatherless homes. Or if you don&#39;t want to get poor you need to do these three things: 1- finish highschool 2 - get full time job 3 - wait to get married before you have kids. Obviously there are exceptions. And those things could be just correlations. But sometimes the statistics is a good guideline to make a smart decision. And sometimes the lived experience can blind you into romanticizing the live of another group. I&#39;ve heard plenty of people complaining about one thing and the white folks experience the same thing to the same degree. Or guy can just as easily feel afraid in the dark if there is a group of guy across the street. <br><br>And just to take a step back. I also don&#39;t like people who constantly shout that they care about nothing but the facts. Normally if someone constantly calls himself brave he isn&#39;t, and if he constantly calls himself rational, he has big biases and if he constantly calls himself tolerant then he isn&#39;t. Here I agree with you.

 Wow, this is incredibly disingenuous.

The &quot;criminalizing poverty&quot; quote is a good example. The tools at issue are not only effective, as the quote itself says, but help poor and minority communities by reducing crime in their areas. Yet this is framed as &quot;criminalizing poverty&quot; without any acknowledgement that poverty correlates with crime, creating a legitimate call for policing. This is clear evidence of bias in favor of leniency and against the strict application of the law. This bias may seem correct, but all biases do! Biased data must be called out with specific criticism, or we risk falling into the critic&#39;s own bias.<br><br>Of course the problem of data is real, and is best exemplified by the parable of the drunk man looking for his keys under a street lamp.

Biased data has to be called out with specific criticism, such as &quot;we&#39;ve already checked there.&quot;<br><br>Also, we should definitely not trust scientists.

 Not long after watching this I saw a recent interview of Stephen Pinker on the Braver Angels podcast (5/26/21), and several times he made clear that while he believes facts should make a common ground between different viewpoints, his views don&#39;t discount the existence of bias or the ways in which statistics can be manipulated.  He also encouraged viewers to have what he calls epistemic humility, which seems to be more or less the same thing you advocate here.  In this video you lump everyone in the IDW together, that includes Pinker and in this case I believe his viewpoint extends to most or all of them who do believe in discussing with verifiable observations.  So in short, whether you mean to or not, these criticisms are a straw-man.

 I think &quot;Facts DO care about your feelings&quot; is a bad way to represent your argument, because when you break it down you are not arguing that facts are relative, just simply that true facts are very hard to come by, and also indirectly advocating that we be more objective with data collection. The statement that &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is still a true statement, it&#39;s just that we need to be extremely careful in what we regard as &quot;facts.&quot;<br><br>P.S. I never heard Ben Shapiro say that there is an IQ difference by race, and if he did I am sure it wasn&#39;t for the purpose of supporting racism, as Ben is very staunchly anti-racist.

 Zoe, please cite your sources when you are accusing someone of saying something. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=9m17s">9:17</a> you suggested that Ben Shapiro had said that race and gender was a determining factor in IQ. I could not find any evidence of this. It is very irresponsible of you to not cite a source especially since you are an English teacher. From doing a google search I found an article from the Sacramento Bee, written by Ben, where he argues exactly opposite of what you accused him of. The article was about a high school student who had done a science fair project that examined the correlation between race and IQ. The student had concluded that there was a relationship between the two but Ben criticized the findings and argued that there was many factors that the student had not taken into account. Ben&#39;s ultimate point in the article was that we should not make the subject taboo because it will lead to people drawing the wrong conclusion and prevent us from disproving it.

This is a moment of celebration not of condemnation, and yes if this means there will be more police in poor neighborhoods than that‚Äôs a great thing.

 Very interesting watch.<br><br>I remember Jordan Peterson himself saying something similar to this, when he was talking about how political beliefs are all driven by &quot;facts&quot;, sure, but mostly about &quot;which facts&quot; we choose to look at, based on our personal values; he also made a research group that found a huge correlation between personality types and political beliefs. So while everyone thinks to be driven by mere facts, we are driven by personality more than anything.<br><br>Just a question though, isn&#39;t &quot;peer review&quot; aimed specifically at reducing personal bias when making research?

 For the sake of sanity, I won&#39;t get too deeply into the weeds of complex systems, the problem of induction, G√∂del Incompleteness, the impossibility of grounding &quot;Truth&quot; in anything beyond rhetoric and logic derived from axioms necessarily born of our preexisting assumptions, or the arrogance of designating &quot;modernist Western natural philosophy&quot; as the only subject matter worthy of being considered <b>knowledge</b> (scientia in Latin), etc. here in a YouTube comment. I&#39;ll simply say this: the etymological origin of the word fact comes from the Latin verb meaning &quot;to do&quot; or &quot;to make&quot;, facere. Facts are made, not discovered.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re interested for a more &quot;scientific&quot; source that provides a much deeper examination of many of these biases in the context of a particular field, Robert Sapolsky&#39;s lectures from his Stanford course on Human Behavioral Biology are available here on YouTube, and are really excellent and informative, though lengthy.

 From my understanding you are saying that facts can be influenced by biases and opinions and therefore there is a connection between facts and feelings (opinions/biases/etc). With this in mind that the statement &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.&quot; is wrong. <br><br>While I agree with various points in the video, I disagree with the end point.<br><br>Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings. You have not proved this statement is wrong. A fact is a thing known/proven to be true. <br>The statement &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.&quot; is a statement which says that a fact will still be a fact regardless of your feelings.<br><br>Now of course, facts are originated from opinions but that is why the Scientific Method exists, etc. While facts originate from opinions, humanity&#39;s scientific community goes to great lengths to separate facts and opinions using methods to discover evidence and reduce bias. You mention some of stuff in the video, moving on.<br><br>Instead of saying facts do care about your feelings, I think the end point should be that facts can be manipulated to fit a narrative, whether it was manipulated intentionally or not.<br>With that said that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t trust facts but rather you should be skeptical.<br><br>A lot of your examples are outlining cases where the data was wrong or the perceived facts were wrong or the perceived facts with framed in a way that manipulated the facts into an opinion, etc.<br><br>Yes this is something that can be happen. This happening doesn&#39;t mean facts care about your feelings. At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what you feel, 2 + 2 will equal 4. It is a fact that climate has been changing, why it is changing, who is changing, etc are different more complicated questions. etc/ <br><br>Your interpretation facts will often be influenced by your own beliefs, opinions, experiences, and biases.<br>The presentation of facts from another individual to you will be affected by that individual&#39;s own beliefs, opinions, experiences, and biases on top of your interpretation.<br>So yes this connects non-factual elements to facts but that&#39;s that doesn&#39;t change the underlying fact. <br><br>What&#39;s important here is that you need to be skeptical of the supposed facts, a better wording would be to be skeptical of the information being provided to you. Being skeptical in this context means being doubtful of the information, as being doubtful means you are questioning the legitimacy of the information, the presentation of the information, and the data that the information was found upon. You also need to be reserved in developing beliefs and opinions on the information, as being reserved means you are taking the time to be doubtful and to think about the information and to try find reason to believe or disbelieve the information.<br><br>So yes, facts are not necessarily facts. Facts can indeed be presented to people or interpreted in ways that effectively changes the fact into something that is not a fact.<br>That does not mean facts care about feelings that just means you and/or someone else changed the facts based on non-factual elements (feelings, opinions, biases, etc) and you need to be skeptical of this to determine the actual truth.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you would disagree here. I believe in the grand scheme of things we have the same overall opinion. It&#39;s just I disagree with your message &quot;facts do care about your feelings&quot;.<br>I think a better message would be along the lines of think for your self because facts can be manipulated and you need to be skeptical even if the other persons sounds very reasonable, while also going on to say that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t ignore facts, etc.<br><br>Of course that&#39;s a bit too long... I&#39;m not entirely sure how to condense into a concise message.

And so, it&#39;s not that 2+2=something dependent on the feelings going into the question. It is not Facts /change/ to your feelings. But, it is that we mention 2+2=4 to underline the rigidity of certain factual understandings we have. We are the falling tree of 2+2=4 for its sound, not its vibration. <br><br>Talking fully abstractly, the phrase would be &quot;the validity of a fact is independent of any notions about it, but the way it is pursued, formed, presented, and proliferated do&quot;.

Just as we&#39;ve never heard a fact that was not fundamentally laced with the biases and direction its presenter placed it with. &quot;2+2=4&quot;, as a rhetorical device, is a bias towards a consistent perspective on absolute truths, and could be used to set up a conversation to make extremely simplistic and absolute claims about a conversation, much in the same way 2+2=4 does.

 I&#39;m sorry, where the hell did you get the information that a bunch of MATHEMATICIANS and ENGINEERS would somehow not make the predictive model with (variably) weighted statistics, based on type of crime, and with various output modes? Because it is very easy to use even the publicly available ones and filter the information based on type of crime committed. This is really basic stuff.

 Sow, I&#39;m late, but I&#39;ll post my mini-essay of a comment anyway :D<br><br>This entire discussion reminds me of when I started my first statistics and methodology course at uni. It started with the teacher saying something like: this course is going to dishearten you about science.<br>He went on to say we never have 100% certainty about something being the truth because of the way we use statistics. And also how publication bias and publication pressure have a huge effect on which articles get published and are relatively easily available. Everything is logged and can be found if you know the proper way to find it, but your regular Bachelor&#39;s student won&#39;t do that. There&#39;s a huge bias towards publishing papers with statistically significant results (what that means depends on the research and the field it&#39;s done in) and the quality of the papers can go down because scientists are pressured into publishing a certain amount of papers in a certain amount of time to stay relevant.<br>This leads to people &#39;manipulating&#39; data (wrong statistical analysis or leaving out measurements so the results become significant) or just using student assignments (this truly happened and I&#39;m horrified) to get as many papers published as possible.<br>I think hardly any scientist truly wants to do this but you also want to stay relevant. So what do you choose? In this way, facts do care about feelings. The feelings of the committees who decide which papers get published (and when) in their journals. And the pressure to be in the best journals is high too.<br><br>I&#39;m at home in the medical field and the research that comes with most of the topics within. I wouldn&#39;t call myself an expert on most of it by any means but I do know how to read the research. From the chemistry to the tech.

 She does a whole video on science and the scientific method and bias but fails to mention even one time a thing called peer review. Incase anyone doesnt know peer review is a process of many individuals who try to make sure bias is minimized when someone submits a scientific paper. As for her example of crimes being located more centrally on poor neighborhoods an easy way to fix this In my opinion is to assign different crimes different weights based on severity (someone broke your mail box weight of 2 vs someone shot up a church   weight of 10) with 1 being less severe and 10 being more severe. Sure weighting based on severity of the crime is bias but I&#39;m sure most can agree that mass murder is worse than taking a baseball bat to a mailbox. To reduce bias we could get x amount of people who think 1 way and x amount of people who think another(maybe even more groups with different mind sets to increase bias reduction) and have them all weight different crimes and take the mean of each crime.

 I get what you mean, but I think you misinterpret what the phrase ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings mean‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a supporter of Ben Shapiro at all and I‚Äôm far from a conservative right, but he is right on this point. Facts are rigid and objective and true regardless of what we believe about them - there is a fact, x, out there that exists and it will still be true regardless of our opinions on it. Gravity on earth pulls us towards it at 9.82m per second, that is true regardless of what we think about it. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù means. The problem arises not from facts being objective, but from people performing bad science and making false or inaccurate hypotheses. If Ben Shapiro doesn‚Äôt acknowledge conflicting studies that prove his position wrong, HE is the one who is wrong and HE is the one putting his feelings in the way of science and the objective facts. But that doesn‚Äôt mean facts care about our feelings, that means he and the studies and results he based his beliefs on were wrong and his viewpoint needs to change. That doesn‚Äôt make the fact dependent on his feelings, it makes him wrong. So no, facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings.

 You do bring up some interesting points. I know you were using the crime model as a hypothetical, but you seem to conclude that a model is unjust based on the assumption that the model is feed with data of all crimes. Is it? Or do those statistical models only take data from violent crimes? Also, I&#39;m not suggesting that even if it is the case that the model only takes in stats from violent crime that it would only output black and Hispanic neighborhoods. The output can&#39;t be determined anymore than an accurate data set can be assumed based on your hypothetical. If you were honestly advocating that a statistical model be abandoned rather than this only being a hypothetical, it would qualify as a straw man. BUT, perhaps what we can learn from this is not abandon the statistical model altogether, but clearly define that it should only be feed with violent crime? In actuality, your argument may just be a a description of a specific test scenario as part of a larger integration test?

 Your argument only serves to validate the point being made. There are easy to use methods to determine how valid and objective the fact you use are. It does not require you to have an advance degree in a particular area of research to determine if the methodology used by those researchers are sufficient to validate their conclusions. You suggest that perspective clouds your interpretation of facts, and that is where you lose any rational mind. Of course perspective and emotion can affect interpretation, nobody argues that it doesn&#39;t. The reality is that your perception does not change the facts. It&#39;s your interpretation that is called into question, not the facts themselves. Ben does a very good job of addressing these criticisms. You&#39;ll notice that the facts that he uses are sourced to well established and methodologically sound citations. Your example of the crime data, as you admit, was effective in reducing crime. The fact is that had crime not continued to be highest in those areas, the program would have directed police elsewhere. And furthermore, in the majority of primarily poor neighborhoods, the population overwhelmingly want more police involvement. You start out the video suggesting that you are not going to suggest that there is no objective truth, then predictably, you end the video doing just that. 

 	Replies: ['John McElroy', '@CPASR Also, I would suggest that categorizing facts as absolute may be an exaggeration. While facts are certainly evidence based, they are not precisely absolute as additional evidence may come to light that negates previously accepted conclusions. A sample size of a hundred thousand is pretty significant in terms of a particular study, even though this is really a small fraction of the overall population. The vast majority of studies are much much much smaller, especially those used to support much of the leftist ideology.', 'John McElroy', '@CPASR That argument does not support the claim that facts care about emotions, it only speaks to the methodology used to observe the facts. Even a color blind person knows that the sky is blue, even though they may not see that color, because there is sufficient evidence from other observers to make a compelling argument. The same could be said for blind people, although they may have no frame of reference by which to make an authoritative statement in that regard. This is why anecdotal evidence is dismissed in any empirical study. Now I suppose you could make the argument that something like a mood ring, where your emotional state might have an impact on the color you see, but that&#39;s a weak argument. There are great lengths taken to eliminate bias, especially emotional bias from empirical research, precisely because emotions are known to corrupt data. So the only logical argument to suggest that facts DO care about feelings, is in that facts require an absence of feelings, otherwise, they are not facts, they are opinions. So only in the sense that facts care about feelings being ignored do facts care about feelings.', 'CPASR', 'Facts are absolute. The way we interpret them isn&#39;t.

 You said that nuisance crimes are more prevalent in poorer neighborhoods: do you then hypothesize that more serious crimes aren&#39;t? I don&#39;t see anything wrong with doing the initial analysis with raw data on where most crime occurs. Of course after you increase police presence in a region you have to adjust the model because areas with more police presence would get highlighted futher as stated in the video. Cathy O&#39;Neill sure makes some strange claims like zeroing in on the poor and criminalizing poverty. Should the police then be spread out evenly across urban areas, reducing their effectiveness and protecting the poor LESS. The poor are also victims of crimes more often than well-off people, are they not? This has nothing to with racism, unless you stretch the meaning of racism to fit your personal narrative: race isn&#39;t a parameter in PredPol but race (unfortunately) happens to correlate with poverty etc.<br><br>In my view the intellectual dark web is a countermovement to left wing ideology.

 Zoe Bee:<br><br><br><br>I thank you for your video. Nonetheless, I still have found points I‚Äôd like to explore so as to make clearer the position that Ben Shapiro and others of the ‚Äúintellectual dark web‚Äù, as you happen to call them here, have. I know you didn‚Äôt want to get into any controversy, but as you mentioned previously, facts do care about your feelings‚Ä¶ or do they?<br><br>Let‚Äôs begin by stating what we agree on. We do agree that our formal society has a beginning in the eighteenth century with the ‚Äúphilosophes‚Äù in France. They did believe in objectivity and throwing away all values related to the ‚Äúancien regime‚Äù of kings, wars, religion, etc. We also agree that objectivity is not heald by a single individual, but truth, it exists. We are on the same page about that. <br><br>Having said that, the things we disagree on are more relevant to the discussion, therefore I proceed to mention them briefly: the people these intellectuals are targeting are not people who have been discriminated nor anything as such, rather people who believe that the system upon which the United States of America is based is still discriminatory and fulfills some sort of evil end that cuts off their personal freedom, hence it should be entirely reformed. This position is absurd due to many reasons but I have no place to talk about it at the moment. We also disagree on the way we see the subject: to you they are some people who believe getting facts out makes them completely reliable and bearer of truth itself, to people who actually follow them, it means conservative/ classical liberal journalists that are just doing their job, afterall, journalists are supposed to provoque sensation as Milo Yiannopoulos does (by the way, you forgot about him). It‚Äôs this last point upon which I will concentrate.<br><br>The job of a journalist is to write about what happens in the world to his readers while causing sensation to make him noticed; he does not only inform people, but can give his opinions on the subject as well, and it is through his opinions that readers prefer him before another. By no means does this mean that the readers will only read one journalist and not listen to any others‚Äô voices, the good reader knows that is not a good position to take. He knows that if they are going to Ben‚Äôs Show he will get the perspective of a conservative Jew, whereas going to Jordan Peterson‚Äôs channel will be a classical liberal from Toronto perspective, and the New York Times‚Ä¶ well, you get the idea. The good reader knows that in order to get a more unbiased view of a certain issue, one is to ponder every single point of view, afterwards, one can draw his own opinion on it. Yes, getting informed is costly and hard, but it‚Äôs an art one needs to master in a more polarized world like the one where we live in today. On this regard, Ben is clearly voicing his mind on certain issues and he tries to back himself with facts either from scientific research or any other sciences. He knows he does not know everything because it‚Äôs no part of his job to do so, however it is his job to get facts and back his position with them, it‚Äôs every journalist‚Äôs duty to know a little on every single subject that can concern social life, otherwise they‚Äôre useless in the industry. The story behind the phrase you use about facts not caring about your feelings has significance every time Ben says it; you can check when he said it to a trans-female that threatened him on air, it has, since then, become some sort of a branding strategy, however it doesn‚Äôt follow that because it is a branding phrase he has the absolute truth, that would be nonsense. Therefore, we can agree that the meaning of it does not rely as much in its absolute sense as in its contextual one. Now, I know many of the people who ‚Äúget informed‚Äù just listen to their ideologically-aligned journalists, but that‚Äôs precisely why developing this skill is important; before, it was taught in a domestic ambiance, now, when adults grant much less time to their children, it‚Äôs meant to be taught in schools‚Ä¶ nonetheless, this has shown to fail when as a university-level professor, you get youth that has no idea what precisely happened in Pearl Harbor in nineteen forty-five, or where North Korea is found.<br><br>Lastly, I would just like to remark that there are important issues in the United States that are not being looked at. And if the left minded about not radicalizing itself as it has been, maybe they would be more popular. People don‚Äôt like radical change, that is a fact that doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings, but that I got to express due to my personality.  A feeling is ephemeral, and a personality sounds more like something that can condition your choices, although not in a determinative manner. The same way the meaning we give to a word can condition the way we think, but can not change the definition of the word itself. That‚Äôs why I agree with you on changing the meaning we give to the word objectivity, but I would change it to it‚Äôs correct meaning according to the Cambridge dictionary: ‚Äúthe fact of being based on facts and not influenced by personal beliefs or feelings‚Äù. <br><br>One person in the internet.

 I stopped watching when you misrepresented the argument against climate change alarmism. It&#39;s the alarmism and worldwide cooperation in government is the solution&quot; that we disagree upon. <br><br>It&#39;s not that &quot;they feel like the climate is changing&quot; that is wrong. I don&#39;t think even they would say they feel like the climate is changing. They would point to temperature data over a period of time. Our problem is that we believe on evidence that the data is skewed by improper measurement to some degree making the rate of change appear more dire than it seems, that the cause given for the change is human carbon emissions without analysis of the causes and to what degree it is caused, that the climate fluctuates on its own without regard to our intervention and that there are better solutions to having a clean and healthy environment that don&#39;t involve hamstringing our technological progress, especially in America where our emissions are very low compared to other countries especially ones with far more significant populations and emissions of not just greenhouse gasses but actual pollutants. The facts that the climate is warming do not care about my feelings. The facts that the data is skewed and often misleading about how we affect that and how dangerous it could be don&#39;t care about the alarmists feelings. But how we handle it does depend on what we believe or feel the right solution is. <br><br>Just like in the video about grading which brought me to your channel, where you said intrinsic motivations produce freedom, I believe that a solution that promotes freedom for our people to grow and advance is a much better solution than ones that regress our people because the advancement may cause the rise of greenhouse gasses the outcome of which we cannot actually claim from data will result in what the alarmists believe on blind faith it will cause. Especially when such regression will have negligible impact on the climate emissions of human beings overall. We have more than enough room in our atmosphere to hold other countries to our standards and tell them they need to clean up rather than hamstringing ourselves to no benefit than it makes the myopic alarmists feel better while doing nothing to actually change the output of humans as a whole that alarmists claim is killing our planet. We haven&#39;t even reached the peak concentration to where if you add more carbon plants don&#39;t consume and grow any bigger. We still have to add carbon dioxide to greenhouses artificially to get the best yields from the plants inside.

 Your line of argument and presentation on scientific methodology misses a very important point: the verification step of the empirical facts. Simply having numbers that back up your claim is not enough to call them facts. No reasonable empiricist would make such claim. And this verification step is exactly how we address your concern with human biases. It‚Äôs only thru a rigorous process of repeating experiments by other scientists or researchers using the same experimental conditions and observation methods. Only if those data return the same results AND no other countering hypothesis and observations have been made, then do we claim maybe this is real, aka factual. <br><br>A good example of that is gravity on earth. No matter where you observe an apple falling, without other external forces, the apple will fall at approximately the same velocity.<br><br>Also what happens is that due to the limitations of human existence, ie we cannot go to the future and get the most accurate equipment etc, we cannot get everything right at all at once. And people come and attack scientific facts using these exceptions. <br><br>Gravity again is a good example of this. The apple falling only really applies on earth. And our concept of gravity as an elemental force has also been evolving, see Relativity, Quantum Physics, String theory, etc. <br><br>Human feelings and biases are not the same as human limitations. One can be seen as part of the other, however, the methodology itself accounts for those biases. <br><br>In conclusion, that particular part of your argument is biased and/or misinformed. At worst, which I‚Äôm not saying you are, intellectually dishonest.<br><br>Also, I want to point out there is a difference between science and empirical results vs. the application and interpretation/projection of them. Math, Statistical methods, Scientific methods are impartial, however, their applications and interpretations, where models belong, are not. Those need to be distinguished. <br><br>It&#39;s basically a difference between what scientists or empiricists are allowed to called facts and what somebody co-opts scientific research and simply argues for their biases calls facts. You cannot mix and conflate the two.<br><br><br>Lastly, the developments of science and other related fields like math goes beyond European enlightenment. Math, including calculus had been developed by non Europeans. The numbers we use today like 1, are called Arabic numbers for a reason. Chinese had developed geometry and calculus separately. <br><br>Contrary to current diversity trainings, science and math are NOT a white thing. These are historical facts. They don‚Äôt care about feelings.

 It is true that the real facts about global warming don&#39;t care about Ben Shapiro&#39;s feelings. If his &#39;facts&#39; do care about his feelings because of how he chose his sources, that means they&#39;re not the real facts. They&#39;re only what some might call &#39;alternative facts&#39;, but not facts. Cue the tune of &quot;Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats&quot;, and head over to Randy Rainbow&#39;s channel. You have a valid argument against Ben Shapiro, but the title of your video makes a false statement; facts aren&#39;t the facts some individual claims are facts, but which are conditioned by his views and choice of sources: real facts are the out-there Platonic ideal of the real truth; if we give up having a word for those, we will have no way to talk about anything.

 While yes facts are often selectively cherry picked to represent an ideological view of reality representative of a sense of feeling or bias already present in the person. It doesn&#39;t mean we should prioritize feeling above evidence! You instead find factual evidence that can be used as a counter argument. That&#39;s how we come to a more truthful perspective. I don&#39;t see how feeding an algorithm a historical record of violent crime and predicting where it will be is immoral. Yes it will be in predominantly poor areas. Should we just stop policing there and let people die and crime run rampant? No this would be more immoral! Its amazing how many liberals on their high horse want to abolish police while not actually living in the neighborhoods most affected. It shows YOUR BIAS. Should petty drug possession be in there of course not. Should we address the systemic reasons behind why that neighborhood is struggling and forced into crime. Yes of course. But you&#39;re throwing the baby out with the bathwater. You completely mis characterize people like Sam Harris and then wittle down their entire message semantically into &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; while acknowledging at the end that &quot;feelings don&#39;t care about facts&quot; which is the exact same thing just in reverse.

During the World War the most dangerous things to do was ship supplies with ships. A man bought ship after ship. Everyone called him stupid because the fact at that time was those boats were not in use because of boats being sunk by uboats at sea. The perception of the public and the man did not change the fact, but were different. Perception is your argument, facts still do not care about feelings.

 The annoying thing is that it‚Äôs entirely possible to make a crime mapping model that is actually helpful. Just weight each crime based on its seriousness or how many officers are required to deal with it, while simultaneously weighting each area by how many officers were patrolling at the times of each crime. Models when done right are unbelievably useful, but it‚Äôs far too easy to shortcut the process and make a model that looks good on paper while being wildly inaccurate in reality.<br><br>On that same note, people tend to assume modelling is easy, sometimes even the modellers themselves.

 I agree with most you say and disagree with a few.<br>1) For one, I think there is confusion about &#39;the truth&#39; and &#39;a facts&#39; in this video. A fact does not equate to truth. For example, to find a solution for an issue one must reach as near to the truth as one might, and to reach a truth all facts related to the issue have to be taken into account and not just one. Some facts will support the claims of right-wingers and some facts will support the left-wingers. So, If a fact is helpful for an individual with biases that doesn&#39;t mean that the fact is not true or the fact is biased.<br>2) Statistics don&#39;t actually lie, i.e. Numbers don&#39;t lie (if calculated correctly). I&#39;ll take the same example as you did about the police taking round. The statistics which told the policemen where crime happens most are true according to factors taken in during calculating those statistics. The issue isn&#39;t that the numbers are wrong but that the statistics provided didn&#39;t take more factors into account. So the numbers are right for the factors it accounts for. But the numbers can be better calculated with more significant factors and by doing so have a better understanding of the issue at hand.<br>3) Something with irked me was when you pointed names of individuals, Ben and Jordan, and said that they have false facts. It showed your bias; as you said everyone has bias even me. But you didn&#39;t address yours. As I said in my first point, different facts are used by different people with different ideologies. That doesn&#39;t make the fact an incorrect one. Obviously, there will be more to the story, and that many facts together addressed will give the truth. <br>4) So facts actually don&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s feelings but someone&#39;s feelings and biases do feel about some facts. <br><br>So what should be done about it? DEBATE, relentless debate. That is the only way to address different facts cherry-picked by people with different ideologies at the same time. More the debates the better. And ideally, relentless debates should lead to discussions and then to a solution.

 I&#39;ve seen a few videos by Ben Shapiro, and I disagree with nearly everything he says. However, some facts, like the facts about global warming, don&#39;t care about our desire to have more energy available, so the basic idea that facts don&#39;t care about feelings is fundamentally right. However, we can get lots of energy from nuclear power, and our feelings, in the form of our irrational fear of it, are getting in the way of using it.

As for racial differences in intelligence - the facts have totally debunked that. Australian aborigines, almost normal in height, and yet tied for smallest brain size with the pygmies of Africa, have been documented as doing amazing feats of memory. And for more facts - even though he went overboard with geographical determinism - Guns, Germs and Steel have explained why some societies are richer than others. However, a preliterate indigenous tribe won&#39;t have filtered out the learning disability of dyslexia, and there are cultural factors that loom larger, so equality in education won&#39;t immediately produce an equal number of STEM grads from some minorities, the path to full economic equality will be tragically slower.']

Of the 4 men mentioned, it seems to me that they do value emotions as well. If i am wrong, please leave a quote for any of these men saying otherwise. I dont mind being proven wrong. However, it doesnt seem that any of the 4 individuals, according to my knowledge make or imply such a claim. What they ARE trying to say, is that When it comes to Objective Facts, your emotions tend to fool you, and thus when trying to find out if something is a Fact, your emotions arent a reliable guide for finding objective truths. They most certainly tend to cause you to believe false things, and to become quite fallacious. I dont think any of them make a claim like youve mentioned. I really dont think they fit your description exactly. Though perhaps this is kinda too vague to mean anything anyways. <br><br><br>&quot;They believe that mankind can only prosper if we unchain the marketplace of ideas from the regulations of censorship and political correctness.&quot; <br><br>I think this is also a misrepresentation. They want a marketplace of ideas. We all should. You want that. Nobody is arguing that there shouldnt be cencorship. However, it`s the context of what to censor that is the question they try to unpack. <br><br>&quot;Obsession over objectivity? Reverence for rationality? Fixation on Facts?&quot; Firstly, i admire your aliteration. jokes aside, when you start telling others what to do or how to think (like your debate in your video, which is a good thing, btw), that&#39;s when objectivity really matters, especially regarding truth. If you can only &quot;prove&quot; something subjectively, it&#39;s not proof at all. It&#39;s just an anecdote which means next to nothing regarding a debate on what is true or false. Anecdotes arent meant to be proofs. They are meant to be story telling devices. Not for proof. <br><br><br>&quot;There isnt a difference in IQ between sexes and races.&quot;<br>Again. None of the 4 make this bizarre claim. They already know this isnt true. This is 100% a Straw Man Fallacy. <br><br>&quot;You just have the data on your side&quot;<br>If the data was on their side, then they would be right so long as the data truly supports their argument, and that the argument is sound.<br><br>&quot;the numbers dont lie... or can they?&quot; <br>Guess 2+2=4 is subjective according to your statement. <br><br>&quot;Im and English professor and this is the 2nd time ive brought up calculus. I think im doing something very wrong with my life.&quot; <br>Not really a point, but still funny to me. Why calculus specifically? you couldve just said &quot;math&quot;. lol. Youre making it as if only very niche things are objective. And as an English teacher, how have you not come across the word &quot;math&quot; while speaking about philosophy of words? <br><br>&quot;Our perception of facts is reliant on feelings&quot; <br>so 2 + 2 = 4 relies on feelings and is therefore fallible?? <br>Wheres the assumptions? Wheres the biases in this equation? <br><br>&quot;If you arent an expert in the field, you dont know the facts. <br>I believe this is a Credentials Fallacy. self explanatory. And none of the 4 men she mentioned assert as such. You can possess knowledge without being an expert in something. You dont have to be a scientist to know and understand that e = mc¬≤, or how to do math for example. <br><br>‚ùó&quot;...how you decide your facts&quot;<br>This is ths critical error. that&#39;s just plainly wrong. By definition, you dont &quot;decide&quot; what a fact is. This seems to be an equivocation fallacy between facts and beliefs. Facts are things that are provable via the scientific method. The scientific method proves to be the most reliable, best we have of identifying truths, and the only known way of identifying objective facts. When Shapiro say &quot;facts dont care about your feelings.&quot; he didnt say &quot;your beliefs dont care about your feelings.&quot; that would be an obsurd claim. He said &quot;your facts&quot; and facts are necessarily objective by defintion, unless youre using the incorrect term meaning &quot;beliefs&quot;. but Shapiro wasnt. This also seems to be a strawman fallacy of his statement due to this misrepresentation/ lack of understanding of his statement. Nobody is debating that we dont have biases. But when there is objective scientific consensus, it is certainly as unbiased as one can get because its peer reviewed and tested over and over to be proven to be true. So, No. To reiterate, You dont decide what are facts. and theres no such thing as &quot;your facts&quot; only &quot;the facts&quot; because facts are, by definition, not subjective in any sense. only &quot;your beliefs&quot; are subjective. An equivocation fallacy.<br><br>&quot;they were presented with the same facts, but their feelings changed how they perceive those facts&quot;<br>Now you are speaking of objective facts. And yes, feelings and other biases and affect your interpretation of the the raw data, but with the right argumenta, however, when the argument is solid, thereby being objective, your feelings to not in any way affect what the fact actually is, only on your beliefs or interpretations of the facts. <br><br>For example. <br>Most shark attacks happen in shallow waters.<br>this could lead us to conclude that deeper waters are safer.<br>This is a questionable cause fallacy, implying that correlation always implies causation. <br>One could easily perhaps by reasonably claiming &quot;shallow waters is where all the people are.&quot; <br>By learning to identify fallacies, trying to hammer out your own arguments, and having others test out your arguments are ways we can identify possible fallacious reasoning, thereby, the more an argument is properly checked for fallacy, the more reaaonable it is to say that &quot;belief&quot; is less effected by your feelings. Though even still, this is only regarding beliefs and not facts. facts are true regardless of belief. So again.... facts objectively dont give a damn about your feelings. <br><br>Again i dont think Shapiro said that Gender have an IQ gap of any kind or Races. please source me if i am wrong though. <br><br>I dont think i need to move any further.

 This video presents blurry arguments throughout it that are not well communicated; for simple reasons. Hopefully this feedback will be taken into consideration.<br><br>Zoe basically says, &quot;reality is objective (by definition) but we cannot assimilate all of reality (lack of knowledge, techniques, resources, time), so we are forced to choose specific minute samples of it to make deductions; deductions which are biased by the picking we have operated beforehand. And those biases were guided by feelings, and more generally human rhetoric.&quot; I have no problem with that, and I even agree.<br><br>But the employment of different arguments that are meant to undermine objectivity are either fragile or beyond the point.<br><br><br>In the police officers argument, Zoe argues, &quot;crimes happen more in poor neighborhoods, so inputting the crime data into a program that will output where the police officers should be directed depending on the area will cause more police to go to poorer neighborhoods, and it&#39;s a vicious circle. Plus, although the program isn&#39;t biased, it will nonetheless point at areas where some races are generally located geographically.&quot; First of all, what does this argument imply? Actually think about it, what does it say? That crimes happen dependently to social classes and races? Yes, that&#39;s the case, but that&#39;s the point of the software. What does this argument even accomplish? You might say &quot;yeah but, thing is, targeting poor or black people won&#39;t solve any issues since it is poverty and the correlation between poverty and different races that should be dealt with, not their inevitable consequences which are the crimes.&quot; If you thought that I understand, but this is beyond the point. It is not an argument against objectivity of facts (which is was supposed to be the point of the video) but an argument against executive criminal methodology. Second, why would it be a vicious cycle?? I have nothing to say about this besides that it was just not elaborated in any explicative way whatsoever.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=10m01s">10:01</a> So? You can mention the technical characteristics of the camera and those will be taken into account. All of which are ultimately, you guessed it, objective. Photography is indeed objective because there are simplistic physical factors that make a picture. Our interpretation of the picture might not be objective, but the photograph is. The physical happening of something is objective, only how we interpret it is subjective.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=10m21s">10:21</a> ??? if there is a variable in Google Maps that&#39;s displayed to show when the picture was taken then that would not be an issue.<br><br>I just don&#39;t see how these examples prove anything, and I just find this video sloppy. Because this whole thing looks like a bunch of random statements that seem correlated thrown together if I&#39;m being honest. Looking forward for a better video. Good luck!

 The dark web is a thing, but they aren&#39;t on the actual dark web. they are just a group trying to get their views and opinions out there. they want people to be informed about what is happening to our country. It sounds like you are trying to correlate them with something that seems shady and with ill intentions. you repeat the words dark web when you mention ben. the main thing ben has been talking about is the riots and illegal activity BLM has committed, how states have had crime rate increases since they&#39;ve defunded the police, and Joe Biden&#39;s horrible policies. the chart that you use should have observation after the hypothesis. the chart is for the most part correct just needed that one change. yes, there can be bais in research, that&#39;s why we have the anti-vax movement. there are ways of reducing its effect. such as statistics. if you see an increase of 5% in a study, you should see if there are other variables that haven&#39;t been looked at. however, when it comes to 20-30% that is when you can see that an event has majorly affected your study. you are making a lot of positive claims, yet you don&#39;t take a moment to prove them other than the one article that says if you aren&#39;t an expert, you tend to let your feeling get in the way of facts. in the future you could show an article that contradicts ben, while you show a video or comment of his statement. this would show the audience that you are credible. what you say about the pictures is correct, however, you should have should a study with numbers that showed bias. also, Google has to update its maps all the time. expecting them to be perfect isn&#39;t an argument on good ground. no study should ever be expected to be a perfect representation of reality. only something that can be pointed to why something could be the way it is. a heat map is a good way of reducing crime in an area. if crimes happen often in a certain area it will show that on the heat map, so to reduce crime they will send officers to patrol that area and the area around it. so it is a bad thing to put criminals (I am not talking about poor people) in jail. so reducing burglaries by 23% is a bad thing. I can agree though if the data is improperly used it could, and has in certain states, result in abuse from the police. however, it seems you are saying that the majority of police are using this data improperly to arrest innocent poor people. facts aren&#39;t squishy, that&#39;s what opinions are for. reducing burglaries by 23% is what most would consider a fact. numbers don&#39;t lie, people do. that is why credibility is such an important thing and that you review a study with peers and experts. the numbers speak for themselves segment would have been an excellent time to prove your statement with a study that was mishandled or even a rigged chart that showed more improvement than there actually was. however, you never take responsibility for the burden of proof. you should always prove a positive claim. anyone can be objective, you just have to be aware of when your feeling is influencing your study or observation.

1943: B.K. Price 
 Your example on the police models didn&#39;t work. As the quote stated, when using the models burglaries decreased by a certain amount. Just because it was concentrated in poorer areas was irrelevant. The ideal purpose of police is not to have an equal amount in every area so that a bunch of them are sitting around twiddling their thumbs. It&#39;s to stop crime. Crime does happen more frequently in poorer areas, and I don&#39;t like that correspondence any more than anyone else, but concentrating police where crime is concentrated is exactly the definition of effective policing. Having them walk around a rich neighborhood with nothing to do is not and helps nobody. From what you showed, the models helped stop exactly what they were intended to stop: crime. Feelings, in this case, just get in the way, because people are so worried about the poor being targeted &quot;because they are poor.&quot; No, it&#39;s because poverty breeds more crime than affluence, and thus is in greater need of policing. There are plenty of legitimate concerns to bring up with policing that are not because of facts, but this one is simply obvious. You send the police to where the crime is. 

 	Replies: ['B.K. Price', '@Henrique Pacheco I agree, but the example provided in the video, as far as I can remember it, did not show such a disproportionate skewing. It accurately pinpointed the areas that were more susceptible to crime and allowed the police to reduce the crime rate. Other considerations can be brought in, but you have to adjust the data parameters accordingly. The example given showed the opposite of the video&#39;s statement. It shows data, devoid of feelings, providing an effective and tangible solution for the stated goal. Other matters may be dealt with in the same way. I don&#39;t disagree that there is a lot of need for police reform, but having them roam crime-free streets so that they don&#39;t feel &quot;disproportionate&quot; is not what is needed. It&#39;s ineffective and an example of how feelings don&#39;t help in solving the problem at all. To reform police we must use solid facts to pinpoint problems and devise solutions. I don&#39;t know why this is such a hard concept.', 'Henrique Pacheco', '@B.K. Price There&#39;s a difference between the data skewing towards poorer areas, and the data <b>disproportionately</b> skewing to poorer areas. Moreover, the way we deal with minor offences tend to perpetuate social issues that lead to those, and the police is the arm of the state in such action. We need to overhaul our broader justice system, yes, but the police forces themselves also need reform in that process.', 'B.K. Price', '@Henrique Pacheco The data SHOULD skew toward poorer areas because that&#39;s where the majority of the crime is. Putting cops in areas where there isn&#39;t much crime doesn&#39;t help poor areas, who have to live with the high crime rate, but the very example cited showed that the application of the statistical analysis did exactly what it was designed to do: lower the crime rate. The sentence for petty crime is handled by the courts and has no relevance to the subject of stopping crime during its commission. Police don&#39;t and can&#39;t patrol for white-collar crimes. They do handle them, but in the given example they are irrelevant because you&#39;re not going to come upon a rich guy on the street embezzling money. Stopping white-collar crime is done by investigation, not beat patrols. The example given in the video dealt with statistics designed to lower crime. They lowered crime. Facts work. If you want to deal with the other problems you would need to utilize other data sets and add other considerations to the equation, which would need to be equally devoid of feelings, to get an accurate picture of where the problem lies so that you can formulate a solution. Facts, once again, would guide people to the solution, like they did in lowering crime rates. I&#39;m sorry, Henrique, facts still don&#39;t care about your feelings, at least not by the standards of the stated example.', 'Henrique Pacheco', 'But the data will recursively skew more and more towards policing poorer areas, since, with more patrols on said areas, more petty crimes will be caught. This leads to a vicious cycle that ends in overpolicing, not helped by how some acts in the USA that really shouldn&#39;t be considered criminal can lead to prison sentences, and thus these neighborhoods will become even more impoverished, due to constant police presence and pressure.<br>Not to mention how the scale of crimes committed on richer neighborhoods, and especially commercial/business oriented ones, and our treatment of them vary. White-collar criminals effectively stealing millions get less harsh treatment by police than pickpockets. There&#39;s something broken there, when a crime on a much larger scale, and with much more severe consequences, is considered a less serious offence.']

 (I&#39;m a little late on this video but I wanted to get my thoughts down any way.)<br>I liked your conclusion about objectivity actually being about taking your feelings into account so you know where your blind spots are and orienting your self accordingly. As you mentioned models can be wrong and biased if the data they are fed is biased and/or incomplete (which are all models). That doesn&#39;t mean reject the idea of facts and modeling but to take them with a  grain of salt and constantly be looking for more data. which is where I think your argument get a little confused because I think you actually agreed with ben in the end.<br><br>Shapiro might not mean it this way but the phrase &quot;facts don&#39;t care about you feelings&quot; to me sounds more like a method of being objective by acknowledging that people have a tendency of rejecting facts that conflict with their feelings. So whatever college student he is talking to is working with a set of facts and likely ignoring  the facts that he then says. (he&#39;s also a jerk about it most of the time so they don&#39;t get a chance to gather their thoughts and counter.) Which is that same problem that you have with modeling having a biased input source. <br><br>I think the solution is to collect as much data as possible from all sources including the source that disagree with you feelings and data that is harder to come by. Think of the crime heat map model if they collected data from every square all the time rather then the convenient ones they patrol anyway. It also means as people we should listen to people who have non-mainstream views and mainstream ones. While  considering facts that undermine your point of view and not letting your feelings get in the way of that process. <br><br>I&#39;m sorry for the essay.

 I thought you&#39;d have a legitimate counterpoint to Ben, something along the lines of our perceptions and subjective reality are always colored by emotion or preconception, and that it is possible for people to draw radically different legitimate conclusions from the same data set. There is some evidence for this and the philosophical debate rages on, but you did not.<br><br>Instead, you proceeded to deny scientific evidence you take personal issue with and then check off a laundry list of fallacies that you feel support your position. This is would be no different from Flat-Earthers, Creationists, or Anti-Vaxxers, except for the fact you seem intelligent enough to have read and understood the studies you enthusiastically deny. This is not an attempt by you to come to the truth through other means, but a malicious attempt at deception through partisan propaganda, evidenced further by the fact you expressed opposition to the very idea of objectivity.<br><br>To quote a film villain: &quot;Search your feelings, you know it to be true.&quot;<br><br>If you do attempt to approach this topic again (and you should, you seem passionate about it) consider removing political jabs and topics that distract and detract from your main point. Cite specific examples, preferably non-anecdotal, although personal examples of intuition can also work. Finally, avoid fallacies such as arguments from authority and straw-manning. If done properly you could very well change minds or at least open the door to examining some closely held beliefs. As it stands, while you might&#39;ve scored points with those who already align with you, I&#39;ve doubled down and this has reinforced my belief that the other side has nothing of value to offer.

 That people manipulate facts based off their feelings does not change facts perception and reality are different. For instance most days you will not perceive a curve in the earth however that you don‚Äôt perceive it based off your relative position doesn‚Äôt make the world flat. I‚Äôm the end of the day your perception of something doesn‚Äôt make it so there for facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings. (Not a Ben Shapiro fan but all the people saying facts care about your feelings use the fact that we can manipulate things to suit our world view or that we we often operate with flawed statistics or incomplete knowledge doesn‚Äôt disprove that the truth is not ultimately affected by your opinions)

 As a pure mathematician, the type of work I&#39;m interested in is quite insulated from the real-world uses and abuses you tend to see in adjacent STEM fields(at least for the foreseeable future). That said, I would say that in my narrow experience in applied math, a lot of the problems you described in this video are not a symptom of math and models, so much a symptom of bad math and naive models. So much of my job is scrutinizing the assumptions I&#39;m making about a problem in exorbitant detail, so if someone is not questioning the data they&#39;re feeding their model, they&#39;re probably not really doing their job.

 I&#39;d like to add an example my debate coach once used. There was a time that everyone believed the Earth was the center of the Universe. To the people back then, that was a fact. However, we now know that the Earth is not the center of the Universe. So that begs the question, what is a fact? A fact is simply a logical conclusion we come to through evidence we have found. It doesn&#39;t matter how faulty the evidence, as long as a statement has evidence backing it up, and enough people believe it, it could be considered a fact.

 I think her argument was well articulated and I appreciate her perspective. She is right that when developing opinions you use facts from your own paradigm, however I would say the result can justify an opinion. In her police example despite the police using a model to target poor income areas burglaries did drop 23%. I think the police exist to reduce crime and so with a smaller force the PA police were able to do their job 23% better. It may have targeted poor areas but it seems like this is where the police were needed and so in some ways they validated the original hypothesis. To say otherwise would be advocating for crime to climb back up to some degree and this ultimately hurts those in the poorer areas.<br><br>I guess my point is you can evaluate opinions that are based on facts by evaluating their outcomes. We use metrics to do this in the STEM fields. If your unwilling to change your perspectives based on these outcomes then I think it may be pride, bias or feelings that prevent an acceptance. Unfortunately that can lead to a hypothesis bias. This is what I think Ben Shapiro means when he says facts dont care about your feelings. You can have feelings, but to find truth we must be willing to detach when tested.

 This seems to be more of a sidestep of the broader implications of the statement; or, at least, a viewpoint which skips a logical step. <br>A fact is, or can be seen as, something which is. It is an unchanging reality. However, outside of this, is the observation of facts, which is completely different. [You discussed this, yes.] <br>Scientists/mathematicians/everyone has certain biases which affect testing procedure, and thus affect the outcome. More importantly, arguably, is the bias in the interpretation of these outcomes. In fact, it&#39;s why we have the &quot;survivor bias&quot;-- the planes came back with holes, so the holes were reinforced, but that did not affect the rate of planes being shot down. Like this, as you discussed, is the bias in policing through modelling. However, this modelling did accurately portray what was sought after, but it was the solution to the problem portrayed which inadvertently caused another problem. This should not be used as a case against objectivity-- in fact, quite the opposite. The incomplete knowledge which affected procedure in obtaining the facts, as well as the biased interpretation of the facts, affected the outcome, which is just pseudo-objectivity. <br><br>All in all, facts don&#39;t care about your feelings. People just don&#39;t usually have the facts, and when they do, they rarely care about them.

 I&#39;m sorry, but the reason we use models and science is not because we &quot;idolise the rugged individualist researcher&quot; - it&#39;s because it works. Yes, models are based on underlying assumptions made by their developers, and yes, these assumptions can cause a bias in the result if they aren&#39;t 100% true (which they usually aren&#39;t) and they over- or underemphasise certain aspects of the problem. But this does not mean that the model can&#39;t work, it just means that, if something breaks, we need to revisit the assumptions we made along the way.<br><br>Take, for instance, your police chief who uses modelling software to more efficiently patrol high-crime regions. To a degree, this can create a self-reinforcing effect, where previous biases in criminal data lead to more patrols which lead to more criminal data (only to a degree because this obviously doesn&#39;t affect crimes reported by citizens, such as burglaries). Or it can lead to a weakening effect, since more patrols deter crime, which leads to a shift in the crime concentration. The only way to know if the model works or not is to look at the results. If the new methods allowed a smaller police force to reduce the number of crimes (in this case burglaries) significantly, then obviously, the model works.<br><br>That the model achieved this result by overemphasising poor, predominantly minority neighbourhoods could be the result of bias in the modelling assumptions, or it could be because there is actually a correlation there. Dismissing any unexpected result of a model as bias is wrong. You can&#39;t evaluate a model just based on whether its results agree with the expectations. Unless it can be directly shown that there is a bias in the modelling assumptions, the best indicator of whether a model is good or not is whether it works in practice.<br><br>By the way, calling such a policing strategy a &quot;criminalisation of poverty&quot; because it predominantly focuses on poor neighbourhoods is like calling security systems in banks to prevent bank robberies a &quot;criminalisation of banks&quot;. Yes, the focus of the system is on the bank, but (1) it doesn&#39;t criminalise being in a bank, it just makes it more likely that actual criminals get caught, and (2), it exists for the protection of the bank, not for nefarious reasons. Similarly, policing poor neighbourhoods (1) doesn&#39;t criminalise poverty and (2) protects poor people from crime. That is the right strategy if and only if criminality is actually more severe in these regions. Which brings me to my last point:<br><br>&quot;The numbers say X&quot; is not a copout. Sometimes, the numbers just say uncomfortable things. That&#39;s not the fault of the person making the argument, they aren&#39;t intellectually lazy or using a copout, they are just stating their opinion based on the numbers. You can now do two things: Refute the numbers (if you can) or accept that, in fact, the numbers do appear to say X. Numbers don&#39;t make something an absolute truth, it can be challenged if some error in the methodology behind the numbers emerges - but until that counterargument can be made, it is disingenuous to dismiss someone because their argument is &quot;the numbers say X&quot;.

That&#39;s one of the things that makes science different than faith. Science are constantly trying to disprove itself although as the methods used are getting better it is more likely that scientific facts gets a new scope, something I addressed in my answer to Montreal Paul or Other with the well known example of the white swan.<br><br>&quot;Taking your example, most people would say gravity is a force.&quot; Yes, gravity can be caused by contracting space and that would change how we deal with gravity in space but for gravity on earth things haven&#39;t changed because we can still work with gravity as a force and predict results with enough accuracy for daily use.

We still use them today even though we know that the earth is a globe, why? Because they still work for what we do with them. We are perfectly fine with the curvature that are in our straight lines because it doesn&#39;t matter if we are building a family house. If you wanna build a long bridge then you have know the real science and use it or the bridge will fail. Science is constantly changing but usually in a way that doesn&#39;t invalidate earlier observations, The new science may improve the precision. Anyone really working with science knows that it&#39;s not perfect and new theses are constantly tested to see if they fit better than what we already have and can predict things we don&#39;t already know. This is science.<br><br>&quot;Something that was touched on in this video is that some people, like Ben...&quot; This too I already addressed. The problem here is that the video doesn&#39;t talk about scientific facts but only about everyday facts and the political &quot;facts&quot; in addressing Ben Shapiro. This is not about facts but about cherry picked data supporting a political point of view. This is about fabricating &quot;facts&quot; that care about feeling, because they are designed to do so. But the &quot;facts&quot; aren&#39;t facts at all but lies. These are political &quot;facts&quot; only &quot;true&quot; if you follow the political agenda.<br><br>&quot;The first assumption is demonstrably false. Human understanding and perception is flawed to the point that studying how and why human perception fails so often to accurately capture reality is a whole science.&quot; No, the assumptions aren&#39;t false, just undeclared. How do you declare your &quot;ideals&quot; and your &quot;facts&quot;? Are letters better than numbers? It will depend on what your ideals are and what the facts behind that question are. I wanna write a book - Yes, letter are better overall to write the ideal book. I wanna do some calculations - Yes, numbers are ideal for doing calculations. If you had used any common scientific method you would have started out by defining your assumptions, ideals, goals and predicted your outcome before you began gathering data and you would have done what you could to remove any bias.<br><br>&quot;Castilla and Benard ...&quot; Yes, I do remember the 2010 study. It was ill conceive as they didn&#39;t account for the bias they build in to the study. By adopting a purely meritocratic environment they specifically demanded the managers to disregard gender and social disadvantages or take any non measured facts into account. This study only affirmed what we already knew. People are bias unless you take care to remove such biases. This is what is usually called soft science and covers fields where the scientific methods aren&#39;t that strongly enforced. Some will unkindly call it pseudoscience. The result was given by the setup of the study itself.<br><br>&quot;My point is that shutting down other people&#39;s argument using the &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; argument is disingenuous, because the argument is designed to try and stop critical analysis of the facts on hand, and it fails to address that the relevance of the &quot;facts&quot; being considered and the perception of said facts is also just as important when it comes to communication and debate. A debate stance that relies on absolute adherence to &quot;fact&quot; is only as stable as the absolute veracity of the facts being presented.&quot;<br><br>My point is that you have to declare your facts before you use them because then they don&#39;t care about feelings unless they are designed to do so. I usually talk about 3 kinds or groups of facts. political facts - constructed facts to promote a political agenda including lies. Common facts - perceived facts including assumptions build on feelings and bias consequently showing the same feelings and biases. Scientific facts - Facts that are cleaned up for as many feelings and biases as human possible and tested and retested according to strict scientific protocols, debated and defended and gone through the process from these to theory with all it entails.<br><br>This video fails because it doesn&#39;t declare what kind of fact and what kind of feelings it is addressing and how the scope is setup.<br><br>No, Ben Shapiro&#39;s facts doesn&#39;t care about feelings because they are political facts aimed at promoting a political agenda.<br>Yes, common facts can care about feelings because they are based in feelings but they don&#39;t objectively care about feelings just the feelings they are designed for.<br>No, Scientific facts don&#39;t care about feelings because great care have been taken to weed out any known feelings and biases and they therefor represent as pure as possible objective facts.<br><br>Disclaimer: You can have other groups of facts and all you need to do is to declare them. These I find cover the scope of the video as it doesn&#39;t declare any and other people have used facts in similar groupings.', 'Alexander', '\u200b@Kurt Frederiksen (I ended up writing way more than I intended. Please don&#39;t feel obligated to respond to this since I&#39;m just airing some thoughts) You&#39;d be surprised by how  many scientific facts have been proven false, or found to have been biased. Taking your example, most people would say gravity is a force. It&#39;s observably a force since we can see things accelerating and pushing, I even treat it like a force when I&#39;m working out engineering problems, but when we change our perspective to a more cosmic length scale, the predictions we make about gravity based our observations here on Earth begin to become less accurate. Scientists now believe that gravity is not a force, but a phenomena caused by contracting space. Something that was touched on in this video is that some people, like Ben, like use the argument &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; to squash opposition to their arguments. The issue this line of reasoning is that it relies on the assumptions that our knowledge of &quot;fact&quot; is perfect and also runs under the assumption that ideals are inferior to &quot;fact.&quot; The first assumption is demonstrably false. Human understanding and perception is flawed to the point that studying how and why human perception fails so often to accurately capture reality is a whole science. The second assumption is also fundamentally unproveable, because asserting that feelings and ideals are less important then fact is, at it&#39;s core, an axiom and opinion. Lines of thinking like this are why we find things like the paradox of meritocracy. If we think that we fully understand a fact, then we run the risk of being compliant with our thinking and reasoning. A relevant study by two scientists named  Castilla and \r<br>Benard at MIT found that hiring managers demonstrated more bias in their hiring decisions when they were told that the company that they were hiring for only had a policy for hiring based only on merit. The applications provided were identical, but there was a 12 percent difference between the number of men and women hired. This difference almost disappeared when the hiring managers were not asked to hire based solely on merit. The conclusion that Castila and Benard came to was that when the managers though that they were being fair and unbiased by looking only at merit, they stopped self-checking their decisions for any implicit bias. As a result, lots of people that though that they were being completely unbiased, were in fact, more biased, because they stopped questioning and evaluating their own perception,  motivations, and understanding of a situation.<br>If you&#39;ve read this far then I guess I&#39;ll tie this into the original train of thought. My point is that shutting down other people&#39;s argument using the &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; argument is disingenuous, because the argument is designed to try and stop critical analysis of the facts on hand, and it fails to address that the relevance of the &quot;facts&quot; being considered and the perception of said facts is also just as important when it comes to communication and debate. A debate stance that relies on absolute adherence to &quot;fact&quot; is only as stable as the absolute veracity of the facts being presented.']

 I do feel there&#39;s a distinction to be made between different fields of science, for example, statistics in particular, data modelling and predictive models all have, as you said bias built in, and people who build them and who use them should know better than to call them facts, from how you get your input data to how you tune your parameters to adjust the models, none of it is an exact science... that is actually the point, creating an imperfect model that can give you reasonably accurate results, but those will never be perfect or exact, and so, you should be pretty careful how you use them. On the other hand fields like Physics want to find actual exact models of how our physical world works and are much more closely related to measurements (which are still to a certain degree imperfect, but we try). I also would like to point out that we have tried our best to remove human bias as much as possible by making sure all science is reproducible and peer reviewed, there will always still be some bias, but we try :). I really liked this video and how you approached the topic!

 I&#39;m not even going to waste 30 minutes trying to slog through this video. Shapiro&#39;s statement is clear and indisputable. He said it to address all the times someone would try to ignore observable results and instead argue about how they wished things would be. You need to rely on facts to have a basis for an argument and without feelings you are able to have a rational and civil discussion. Feelings don&#39;t change the facts. Feelings don&#39;t matter.

Mainly due to the fact that such an experiment would be extremely unethical.<br><br>When I say predictive, I mean something you can predict 100% of the time under a controlled environment. For example, we understand how how the prion protein works. We know that if we introduce prion into a system where there are normal proteins, the prions will trigger a degradation of normal proteins over time. This is an accurate prediction. Prions will always destroy normal proteins (unless we introduce a mitigating factor in the process). Prions don‚Äôt behave like humans do.

 Sure plenty people are intellectually dishonest and cherrypick and interpret facts to suit their purposes - YOU ARE ONE OF THEM.<br><br>Yes if we use probablistic reasoning to predict where crime is most likely to occur we will very likely come to the conclusion that in the areas inhabited by those who for socio-economic reasons are more likely to commit crimes are, it would make good sense to increase policing in those areas. You then postulate that its discriminatry agaisnt those groups who LIVE in those areas when the police arrest more CRIMINALS becasue of their invreased presence in these areas. I can assure you the majority of those people LIVING there who are NOT CRIMINALS prefer it that way because while they suffer from the same socio-economic conditions as the criminals they are also the ones benefitting from increased protection against the criminals operating there.<br>And just how the increased police presence should increase crime in the area thus creating some sort of vicious cycle escapes me.<br><br>And what is personal judgement if not at best just a more subjective informal kind of statistics to form decisions ?

Yes, when doing good science, it IS important to acknowledge your own biases. The best scientist do that already and dismissing findings because it &quot;feels&quot; wrong is bad. Yes, those crime prediction models &quot;targeted&quot; poor communities. That&#39;s where more crimes both violent and non-violent happen and it WORKED.

 Truth is immutable. <br>But then, whose truth?<br>The interpretation of facts is subjective, based upon our inherent human bias. <br>There are, however, some facts that are not open to interpretation. <br>Say, for instance, that the government declare that, according to the latest census figures, there are 1200 people living in my housing estate. <br>This is a fact. <br>A verifiable fact. <br>Say they go on to declare that 95% of those 1200 people are employed. <br>Again, this is a verifiable fact. <br>Then say that they declare that, of the sixty (5%) unemployed people, only forty are actively looking for work. <br>Now we are entering the grey area of interpretation. What does &quot;actively&quot; actually mean? What are the criteria? <br>If they then go on to declare that, of the twenty who are not actively looking for work, ten of those are welfare bums, now we have strayed into inherent bias. We are interpreting motivation not facts.<br>This is where your own inherent bias comes into focus. <br>Declaring that Shapiro, Harris, et al. are members of the Intellectual Dark Web is a conceit, not a fact. <br>In fact, it is no different to your assertion that Shapiro uses his &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; catchphrase to disarm his opponents. <br>When you place people into a grouping (in this case Weinstein‚Äôs madey-uppy group), you seek to delegitimise their arguments in a way that is almost a corruption of an ad hominem argument.  <br>Your video did not cite or show any instances where Shapiro incorrectly uses facts to back up an argument.  If he‚Äôs talking rubbish, don‚Äôt tell us he‚Äôs talking rubbish, show us where he talks rubbish.  God knows, there‚Äôs enough material available online to pick from.<br>You say that Science is ‚Äúsquishy‚Äù and that ‚Äúbias is inevitable.‚Äù  In some cases, this is true.  Not all, though.  <br>Science, when done properly, is intent on producing hard evidence based on replicable data.  Replicable data, which can be reproduced and verified by unrelated groups of individuals.  The other groups may be continents away, speak different languages, etc. but the results should be the same.  If they are not the same, then it is not science.<br>The interpretation of that data may or may not be uniform but the data remains intact.  If we take away this cornerstone of scientific fact, then Science ceases to exist and Art is left in its place.<br>I don‚Äôt know but I would expect that Shapiro is referring to immutable facts, rather than interpretive facts, when he declares that &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.‚Äù  In this regard, he is correct.

 Hey, I just found your channel and gave your video a watch. I must say, I as a massive fan of Dr. Jordan Peterson, really loved your video. There are a few bits where I either disagreed or have questions and I&#39;ll list them in a moment, but I want to say that I honestly agreed with 90% of what you said. Also I really want to read that book you quoted at the end. It honestly seems like a great read and that exert was amazing.<br><br>  My first question happens around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=7m30s">7:30</a> mark. You are roughly saying (or at least what I&#39;m understanding) that because people (who are biased by default) used information they gathered to create a fact, that fact must be one of these (less correct/incorrect to some degree/questionable/not trust worthy). I can&#39;t help, but &quot;feel&quot; that this undermines the importance of what a fact is. From what I have typically seen, a fact is a rule or event that can be constantly proven. An example being 2+2=4. we can always know that 2+2=4 without fear of that changing. If I&#39;m not mistaken what you are actually referring to (and I do apologize if I&#39;m missing something super obvious here) is the person&#39;s react to the fact, or that the person is using his data to create a fact that strengthens his biased view. In the first case I believe that would qualify as a opinion, but the second case is a bit more interesting.<br>   If someone were to use data to create a model to prove their biased point of view (like the Cop model you mention toward the middle of your video) this wouldn&#39;t change the truth of their words, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it is the full truth either. You are correct the Cop model does sound like a disgusting loop, but let&#39;s assume that cops changed their method to a even patrol over the entire city. Assuming the cops by default are patrolling everywhere evenly and the only differences would be the 911 calls or violent crimes, what would this new model look like. Would it prove the original model correct, or would it prove that the model was inherently flawed? Either way we can test it. We can test the &quot;facts&quot; that were given. This is what makes facts different. No matter what, a fact is true, but This doesn&#39;t mean that it is the entire truth, and that means if we don&#39;t like what is being said, we can test it for ourselves or look at the data they used to see if there was a misunderstanding. compared to a opinion which is either right, wrong, or in some cases impossible to prove.<br>   I agree though, people read facts and data with biased eyes. It seems like as people we are driven to look for the things that make us right, rather then looking at things the way they are. tragically I don&#39;t know a solution to this. Even if you&#39;re careful, it is very easy to fall into that same trap. Still I believe facts are the safest way to navigate the world despite the many ways  they can be abused.<br><br><br>   I think the biggest disagreement I have about your video is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=17m39s">17:39</a>. where you say &quot;facts dont care... is just a smoke screen to duck into...&quot;.  I  don&#39;t believe this is a proper way to use the catch phrase of Ben Shapiro (please note I honestly don&#39;t watch a ton of the guy and so I judge this by what I feel the spirit of the phrase is and not the literal words used). His phrase in my opinion is typically used after someone tries to counter some of his facts with personal morals or principles (which typically are not based on much more then the person&#39;s personal feelings or experiences which are generally not reliable). He doesn&#39;t use it to back away from his point, but rather to reinforce it or defend it.  I know this is a small nit pick, but I honestly believe you misrepresented it in this one case (also this entire paragraph is a great example where someone like Ben could simple say &quot;facts dont care..&quot; because it based entirely on my opinions and not on evidence).<br><br>   the only other thing I disagreed with (slightly) was when you said we need to stop putting neutrality on a pillar. Being neutral is always desirable and should always be aimed for, but like you said and the wonderful book you read. We need to keep in mind our own biases. We need to be open about what we feel and think. That way we can be more open to a new perspectives that might actually be better then our current one. to say we shouldn&#39;t view it as a mighty thing, I honestly think is wrong.<br><br>   I highly enjoyed your video overall, and I plan to watch the second part soon. It is honestly refreshing to see someone attacking the arguments and not the person. I am personally not a fan of Ben (just Dr. Peterson), but I still think that trying to have a real conversation with those you don&#39;t agree with is important. Cases like this I think really highlight that point. I honestly found myself struggling to find fault in what you&#39;re saying (which isn&#39;t a great mind set I know). I found myself just watching out of pure interest, so thank you for your hard work. your video was truly worth the watch. I&#39;ll be recommending it to my friends, I think they could learn a bit too from this video.  (P.S. sorry for the terrible grammar English was and is my worst subject).

 I think this video misses the point about the cross-examination of facts and the &quot;crucible&quot; of argumentation. The point shouldn&#39;t be humans are falliable thereby most facts are likewise falliable. This is known and built into the &quot;system&quot;. That&#39;s why science and liberalism are very closely entwined, because they are dependant on each other and, of course, reason. This is why we debate topics, so we can shave off as m√∫ch of those biases and assumptions as possible. This is why we share the steps to reproduce experiments, so others can replicate our examinations of the world and see whether what I&#39;ve said is true or whether the lens which I saw it through has distorted my view. If someone advances a fallacious argument which twists the stats to make a point, transparancy lets opposing party explain the deception or present opposing arugments.<br><br>The human lens can affect our perception of the truth and we can walk down erronious pathways such as phrenology, however, with cross-examination, we can correct such errors. Facts don&#39;t care about feelings and they are certainly the enemy of ideology, because facts can be used by anyone, if they choose to educate themselves. However, there is an issue correctly brought up: most people don&#39;t educate themselves. The idea that only experts hold correct knowledge is ... anti-democratic. However, it is widely believed to be true. We often trust the experts to tell us what to think, how to eat, how to live. Kant directly addressed this sort of behaviour in &quot;Was ist Aufkl√§rung?&quot; &quot;Enlightenment is man&#39;s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one&#39;s own understanding without another&#39;s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one&#39;s own mind without another&#39;s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) &quot;Have the courage to use your own understanding,&quot; is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.&quot; If we listened to the Enlightenment, then we wouldn&#39;t say &quot;I know this because this person told me&quot; we would read the papers, we would seek to understand the facts. Too many people simply believe &quot;science&quot;, but the very act of taking &quot;science&quot; at its word is a travesty of science. Science isn&#39;t right because of authority. It is right because it needs no authority at all. It offers proof and the reasonable person must admit its proof or refute it. Believing in science is just another dogma of superstitution. The issue isn&#39;t that the Enlightenment is wrong or bad, its that people don&#39;t want to do the work:<br><br>&quot;Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain minors all their lives, long after nature has freed them from external guidance. They are the reasons why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as guardians. It is so comfortable to be a minor. If I have a book that thinks for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who prescribes my diet, and so on--then I have no need to exert myself. I have no need to think, if only I can pay; others will take care of that disagreeable business for me. Those guardians who have kindly taken supervision upon themselves see to it that the overwhelming majority of mankind--among them the entire fair sex--should consider the step to maturity, not only as hard, but as extremely dangerous. First, these guardians make their domestic cattle stupid and carefully prevent the docile creatures from taking a single step without the leading-strings to which they have fastened them. Then they show them the danger that would threaten them if they should try to walk by themselves. Now this danger is really not very great; after stumbling a few times they would, at last, learn to walk. However, examples of such failures intimidate and generally discourage all further attempts. &quot;<br><br>Freedom is hard and the prospect of being ultimately responsible for your failures and successes is terrifying. However, just because people neglect and run from &quot;the government of self&quot; (to borrow from Foucault) doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t work. The humans are falliable hasn&#39;t stopped us from achieving great things and steadily pushing back the boundary of possible and impossible.<br><br>Edit: this was not an attempt to make a defence of Shapiro, but the Enlightenment. They say a cult&#39;s message has 9 of 10 reasonable and well founded points. It&#39;s only in the 10th point do we find the cannibalism.

 Fun Fact: The Enlightenment philosophers were largely trying to use reason to prove religion right, not wrong. They weren&#39;t against religion and believed that by using our capacity for reason, we could arrive at a deeper and truer understanding of God. Galileo outlined this position (albeit ahead of the Enlightenment) &quot;I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.&quot;

 I do think we should evaluate our own biases in search of truth, but avoiding logical fallacies becomes hypocritical if you ignore the fallacy fallacy. It shouldn&#39;t be assumed that someone is coming to the wrong conclusion or their observational data is wrong just because they use fallicous reasoning. The reverse applies as well, a wrong answer can imply faulty observation or faulty analysis, not necessarily both.

 1. There is no such thing as &quot;perception of facts&quot;. There is only facts. And we can separate our bias from them. The scientific method didn&#39;t come out of thin air without a purpose. We noticed that we are wrong about a lot of things, and then looked at the factors by which that was achieved, and we based the scientific method on those factors. Meaning that the scientific method is there to prevent the contribution and effects of any kind of bias to the process of science and research, giving that the scientific method was found by the destruction of our bias. Your ignorance of how science and research operates, doesn&#39;t mean that facts care about your feelings.<br><br>2. The fact that Ben or anyone is cherry picking studies and research and exclude others, doesn&#39;t change the fact that they are objective facts. You can always look for the sources yourself. And if a study seems to contradict another then one of them is wrong, or the subject is still in the process of study, or that the person is misrepresenting the research, which can be cleared by reading the studies yourself. Your laziness to fact check sources, doesn&#39;t mean that facts care about your feelings.<br><br>3. The perception of lightning doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t know that there is an objective position to the source. We know that Google maps can be outdated and blurry, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t objective locations that we know are there.<br><br>4. Nobody says that the programs that the police use are perfect. They&#39;re obviously flawed, but they&#39;re the best method that the police have at the moment. And just because the programs and the research that was build upon them recognize that crime occur mostly in poor neighborhoods, doesn&#39;t mean that poverty is being criminalized. It just means that poverty causes people to resort to crime.<br>5. Models are not opinions. They are objective facts, based on research using the scientific method. ( See point #1).

 All I got from this was that ‚Äúfacts do care about feelings because we all feel, and we can count on facts being messy and biased‚Äù. But there wasn‚Äôt any alternative suggestion. It‚Äôs important as a society to strive for objectivity (messy or not) because if we don‚Äôt it would be chaos. Humans are primal and aren‚Äôt born pure. It‚Äôs important for people like Peterson and Shapiro to exist whether you agree with them or not. I don‚Äôt see the point of this video at all. Facts are feeling based. Ok...now what. People who push for stopping global warming are using biased facts, no? So therefore not really anymore valid than Shapiro‚Äôs feeling based facts? How do you measure feelings?

That&#39;s fine, it just means their initial ideas were incorrect and they can post that right? Nope, every single one was told to fudge the numbers and remove any data points that ruined the researchers theory as being wrong would mean they have nothing worth writing about or nothing to show other higher ups paying the bills.

 There are a couple of problems with this video that I feel detract from an actually fair analysis. This is a bit long, but I&#39;m writing it as feedback because I believe there&#39;s a good argument here that gets lost and I&#39;d like to see Zoe do better, because I think she can, and be a solid counter-voice for more conservative voices.<br><br>First, &quot;fact don&#39;t care about you&#39;re feelings&quot; is a true statement. Facts can no more care about your feelings than the heavily used cup of coffee sitting next to me (though in my head it loves me). The interpretation of facts can be subjective, however, which is what I believe Zoe is going for. Unfortunately, this gets lost as she seemingly tries to out-Shapiro Shapiro. <br><br>It boils down to: Science is amoral; Scientists are not. There are times when I believe scientists should be as amoral as possible. For instance, I don&#39;t particularly think it necessary for an engineer to consider the social plight of West Nigerians while calculating the tensile strength of a new material. However, I do believe that there are times when scientists shouldn&#39;t be amoral such as a nuclear technician building a device that could be used for a weapon of war. &quot;I am become Death...&quot; and all of that.<br><br>Secondly, and I feel like this hurts Zoe&#39;s case, is that she pulls a very intellectually dishonest tactic. During her video she says Shapiro uses the statement &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; (fine) but then does a bit where she sets up several strawman arguments including one regarding IQ and it&#39;s link to race and sex that she quickly debunks. The implication being made that Shapiro and/or his fandom believe or have used these statements. The problem here is that Shapiro has never used any of those arguments and in truth is very much against the concept of coupling race/sex and IQ. He&#39;s spoken often of IQ used against Jews in the earlier 20th century.<br><br>I do my best to listen to a variety of opinions so I can speak to different topics without utilizing secondhand information and so am fairly well versed with Shapiro&#39;s stances on a number of topics. While I find his stances on several topics to be disagreeable, he has been very clear about where he stands on the topics Zoe mentions. Giving Zoe the respect she is due as an English Professor, I have to assume this is intentional and she understands that she is using linguistic tricks to manipulate her viewers opinions. If her arguments were strong enough to stand on their own, she shouldn&#39;t have to resort to that.<br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate, because I believe that there is a strong argument to be made in her favor but either through laziness or an intentional desire to mislead her audience she relies on cheap tactics to take shots at her subject rather than actually dismantling his arguments.<br><br>Third, is her lack of understanding of the so-called &quot;Intellectual Dark Web&quot; (IDW). Intentional or not, I believe Zoe misrepresents the IDW based on her impressions of a few of it&#39;s &quot;members&quot;. The IDW as I understand it is not one homogeneous group of thinkers but a loose collection of individuals from a variety of backgrounds with a focus on discussion, debate and, yes, facts; though tempered by the former two. I actually believe Zoe herself could be representative of the IDW in that she is a non-mainstream personality discussing these sorts of topics. The IDW is effectively just a bunch of intellectuals and personalities debating controversial topics. Many of them disagree with each other but all of them have a shared desire for discussion and debate; which, effectively, is what Zoe is doing here.<br><br>I enjoy Zoe&#39;s videos, even when I disagree, and hope she continues making content. I prefer level-headed, honest conversations to problems which she generally provides. Here, I feel that she missed the mark a little but will continue to watch and support her channel. <br><br>Keep being awesome Zoe!

 A point in support of your discussion of the supposed objectivity (or lack thereof) of Google Maps: there are documented cases of neighborhoods and other geographic areas with informal names and boundaries having those names and boundaries changed in real world usage by arbitrary decisions that Google&#39;s cartographers have made.  Now, if enough people care and push back, Google will change things, but it can be difficult to rally enough people to catch their attention, especially in locations with high turnover (where, unsurprisingly, new residents tend to use the name Google chose because they saw it on Google) and places where the names and de-facto boundaries were already contested as a part of larger class/cultural conflicts.

 Facts really don&#39;t care about your feelings. To argue that this is false because people wrap their baggage around the facts, by wrapping different baggage around the facts, and appealing to feelings in the process, is not a solid argument. What the point of this video really is, though - and that is that people interpret incomplete knowledge of the facts according to their own baggage - is entirely valid. There is the complete truth that is not changed via mere observation, but we are imperfect observers of that truth. What&#39;s great about science is that it operates under that very assumption in its quest for the complete truth. What&#39;s bad about that is when people in general forget/ignore that and wield scientific results as though they are the complete truth, when it suits them. Eg Ben Shapiro.

 I think this is a mischaracterization of Ben, Jordan, Sam and Dave. I don&#39;t think any of them would agree with any of the prefacing statements you made about facts vs feelings. It&#39;s not about people&#39;s feelings not being valid or giving those individuals the right to call themselves what they please. It&#39;s about using data and focusing on data collection methods. There are many players involved in this process and eliminating bias is of tantamount importance. In order to do this effectively, one must be able to have a conversation about what information gathering techniques are valid. One of the main issues today is the inability for anyone to challenge the narrative without being labeled a conspiracy theorist, cultist, racist, sexist or even a &quot;intellectual terrorist.&quot;

 While I don&#39;t see anything specifically wrong with the notion that what some percieve as &quot;Fact&quot; can be influenced by feelings. I don&#39;t think anyone who believes in science would disagree with that. However I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s actually what the famous quote &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is actually intended to &quot;fight&quot; against. What it is intended to fight against is people dismissing facts for the sole purpose that those people find those facts to be offensive. <br>Like for example let&#39;s say someone tells me my nose is big. That can be a statement backed up by data with average nose sizes and whatnot. You can indeed argue about how accurate that data is and if feelings played a role in either obtaining or interpreting it. But that&#39;s different from simply dismissing that statement because I find the statement to be offensive. Models and data can be wrong for all sorts of reasons, whether it&#39;s evil manipulation to get the desired outcome, or an unintended bias due to unforseen factors. But models and data should never be dismissed just because someone said &quot;that&#39;s offensive&quot;. <br>I would much prefer someone &quot;hiding behind numbers&quot; because I could find errors with those numbers or find contradicting numbers from a different source, and we&#39;d have a discussion about it.<br>There is no conversation to be had with someone who hides behind &quot;that&#39;s offensive&quot; because even if my numbers would be 100% objective truth, there is no argument against someone finding it offensive.

 As someone who works with the so called &quot;models&quot;, I can honestly say you should dig deeper into how these models are created and what they take into consideration. You also essentially started talking about empirical data, which is used for analytics such as employment rates and so on, and dropped it all together to talk about models which is something entirely different.<br>Basically your whole point with the video is that facts are not wrong but data is flawed. Once again please look further how that data is used to create models as it&#39;s not as cut and dry as you described in the video.

 I am not sure what you mean. So from your words it derives that facts do not care about your feelings. The facts are the selection of data sets nor their interpretation. That is what poleticians and smoke sellers do. They select what fit their argumentation and hide what doesn&#39;t. Yes total objectivity is impossible. It is a goal. And yes objectivity is desirable and we all should work for it. And that is exactly with the scientific method strives for. The scientific method is not picking a bunch of data from on person and giving an explanation and it becomes fact. The scientific method is based on people of different biases, backgrounds, ideologies, religions and so on obtain their own data upon a topic (replicating the experiment) to avoid measuring biases and when everybody agrees the raw data is unbiased (as possible of course) then different explanations are put in place (probably biased) but the are open to be critized and challenged (again by people of all biases) and at the end it remains the best possible explanation having minimized biased to minimum possible. So, definitely facts are facts and the only issue to take correct decisions is the feelings (biases) people have. We should ensure as possible that process happens. It is like democracy. It might not be the best system but it is the best known system and until there is evidence there is something else better we should be caring for it to stay with us for long.

 I feel like I need to go through every point to provide why it&#39;s so obviously wrong as it seems based on comment section alone that people are to believe herÔºö<br><br>1st facts can (obviously) be split into categories, it is a fundamental mischaracterisation of facts to refer purely to scientific facts if you are to infact make a succesful observation of facts you must observe facts as a whole lest the entire point be the squanderings of a minor category<br><br>2nd The argument so best I can tell made is &#39;If biased people by whatever means found a fact, that fact must be in result of bias not truth&#39; this argument is already nonsensical if approached legitimately as it would require a miriad of other assertions &#39;bias is a permanent and inseperable factor from persons&#39;, &#39;methodologies if created by a biased person, must in themselves be biased&#39; (this one is particularly absurd given a methodology can include to remove bias or nullify it, which apparently cannot be concieved of despite my conception), ‚Äòbias is inavoidable&#39;. The most major and personally hilarious issue is that if you are to make any of these assertions given the premise is true, they equally must be untrue as if you are to argue against facts factually then you inherently fail<br><br>3rd The analogies used are frankly horrendous to whom is it that declares google maps a paragon of objectivity? I know none, besides this the analogy used is as follows &#39;If transformations apply to a thing it is not the objective thing&#39; but may I question quite sincerely to why you expect the objectivity of a thing to not include transformations? y=2x^2 obviously doesn&#39;t display y=x^2 as an objective thing but rather purely itself.<br><br>4th On models, frankly the whole argument confuses me to it&#39;s issue &#39;police are arresting more people who are doing crimes&#39; doesn&#39;t seem like a bad statement in any form given the telos of police is infact to enforce the law (by arresting lawbreakers and such). Take an anology of fishing, the telos of fishermen is to catch fish, if a model provides information on where to catch more fish based on past history it is obvious that they should fish in the said locations lest they be worse as fishermen but now if as she said a feedback loop occurs as they catch more fish in said locations they find that they can catch even more fish, this apparently to her is a viscious cycle? I genuinely hope she doesn&#39;t find productive cycles &#39;viscious&#39;<br><br>5th If you are to make a point, make a point your own so you least have to think on it for slightest of duration, instead of presuming others to think for you in this I say in the citing of that passage does she miss the oh so obvious problem that the models infact helped? a reduction of 23% in burgulary is quite the benefit to say when speaking of something negative, especially when the negative is but a complaint of literally non-existant racism or classism or the such. To a point if you were given the option of to justly send to jail 10 people of specific origin (that we like presumably so blacks or something idk) or to justly send 1 person of less specific origin (that we don&#39;t like presumably chinese or something idk) by any means of non-prejudiced justice you would choose the 10 people.<br><br>6th If models infact represent ideologies and values as the frankly foolish of you believe I request a simple test to this assertion what ideology is contained within the model of y=x+2, I will be quite amazed honestly if you are able to rack your brain for anything even plausible not the less have a true statement of it.<br><br>7th On &#39;enlightenment culture&#39; it seems there is a fundamental misunderstanding, people are understood not to be infallible in any sense in the culture and infact quite the contrary, science is built on the fact of fallibility of observations and models as the whole idea is to test hypothesises for them, the enlightenment also brought upon a great criticism most notably on religion an obvious point of the idea of fallibity not it&#39;s contrary.<br><br>8th Under the statement of factual statements holding people unnacountable, yes, quite obviously unless you find it in any reasonable interest to find singular persons to have omnipotence it be best not hold them accountable for what they cannot control. The other thing is, you obviously have no clue as to the context &#39;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&#39; is used in, as it&#39;s generally not used as way to avoid accountability (with something they already shouldn&#39;t be accountable for mind you) but generally as a counter argument to emotionally based arguments, why would it be a person with no interaction with what they criticise makes a criticism, in this I find a dubious nature.<br><br>9th Boy this list is getting long, but to put simply objectivity is precisely what it is, it need not be achieved by outlay of bias or any kind of<br>self-righteous activity to declare yourself attempting past bias, all that needs to be for objectivity to be achieved is for the following of fact to fact which in it&#39;s inherent nature is not a question of bias but ability to recognize truth as to have facts.<br><br>10th My last, counterpoint should your science deem emotion as a tool for science they should be shunned and exiled from the scientific community quite frankly. What is it that your emotion is to do as a tool? does it measure something like a ruler? no, well does it provide a grounds for less variables in experimentation like a sterile test tubes? no (it even can provide motivation for adding variables), well does it protect the health of the experimenter like a lab coat? no, what the hell do you do with emotion in any reasonable scientific setting?<br>Even if emotion is a tool to give meaning as suggested, how does emotion create any meaning at all, facts in themselves are only discoverables in which they have precise relations to other things and in these relations have meaning, what does emotion add?

 Disclaimer: I&#39;m not defending nobody and neither attacking someone.<br><br>Well, you just found out some of the (multiple) problems of the empirical method. Well, Descartes, back there, had already showed us that. And even Kant (I mean, if you called out Kant&#39;s name I think you were supposed to know his epistemological opinions, specially because that was one of the key points of his philosophy) had showed us some of those problems.<br>This only shows us that deduction is a way better method than the empirical one.<br>But the fact (yes, I&#39;ll use that word) is that facts do exist. The absolute truth does exist, and it&#39;s existence is an absolute truth for itself (I can explain, but I believe that my comment is already long, so I&#39;ll skip the deduction of that, but yeah I can deduce it for ya). So, my point is, it&#39;s not because the empirical method fail that this refuted the sentence. Well, you can use the logical method (which is universal AND NEUTRAL) and find out some facts. For example: A=A is a fact; 2+2=4 is a fact; and those facts are universal and totally independent of your feelings filter. <br>So, the conclusion is that the sentence &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is logically correct, considering that there are a lot of facts that are simply universal, and don&#39;t rely on data nor human experience to be proven. In other words, if 2+2=4 your view that &quot;facts care about feelings&quot; is wrong. <br>Besides that, not considering impartiality as a goal is a way of being against science itself. Yes, the human being have feelings, and yes the human being can be wrong (most of the time, actually). But if we don&#39;t have and objective method of knowing the truth (which, as I mentioned before, does exist), relying on feeling will only make our search for knowledge slower. It will only set us back. That view, besides anti-scientific is actually dangerous. It&#39;s like the anti-vaccines of epistemology. Dangerous and wrong thoughts.

 One thing I don‚Äôt understand about the police argument is that if poor communities have more of these types of crime, why is it bad for police to target these communities? Obviously there is a greater problem with poverty that needs to be solved, but that is not the responsibility of the police on patrol. The police on patrol exist to deter and stop those types of crimes, right? And even if we address the way police handle these crimes, which we should, they still need to be there to handle them right?

 I feel like this video confuses data with the reading of data. Data is facts that people can find using the scientific method, while the reading of data is the interpretation of it.<br><br>If you wanted to find out what eye colour humans have but only do the experiment on Swedish people, the data would say that ‚Äúthe people you did the experiment on are mostly blue-eyed‚Äù. However, you may read this as saying ‚Äúhumans are mostly blue-eyed‚Äù depending on what your hypothesis was or if you knew that Swedish people weren‚Äôt the only humans that existed etc.The data that you got was factual but your reading of the data was not. The reason why we use the scientific method is because it accounts for these biases by checking compounding variables, sample size, sample bias and most importantly, peer reviewing. Even though the data and even what the scientists are saying may be true, that can‚Äôt stop the masses of people from inserting their own biases into it and spreading their interpretation. <br><br> It isn‚Äôt possible for facts to not exist or not be knowable as saying ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt exist‚Äù or ‚Äúfacts do care about feelings‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be a fact and thus would be wrong. The reason why you think that facts care about feelings is because you know that humans have biases, but the only reason why you think humans have biases is because it is a fact and you have seen evidence of it. The only reason why the Predpol software is being questioned is because we have evidence from elsewhere that over-policing is part of the reason why it says minority communities commit more crimes. The data says that the police report more crime in minority areas, not necessarily why that is or even if there is more crime. The software isn‚Äôt looking at all of the variables so it isn‚Äôt doing the scientific method properly. If in the future we invent robots incapable of having bias or being wrong, they will tell us facts as facts still exist even if feelings don‚Äôt. <br><br>I don‚Äôt fully agree with the ‚Äúdark web philosophers‚Äù  and I think that they often fail to see their own biases because they don‚Äôt receive and/or listen to enough constructive criticism to ‚Äúpeer-review their opinions‚Äù , however, I think that the phrase ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù is supposed to mean that you should look into any evidence that comes your way, even if you don‚Äôt want it to be true or ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like it isn‚Äôt true. 

 	Replies: ['Gatuarhin', '@Solace In Our Oblivion The scientific method accounts for that though. Peer reviewing allows people without your biases to criticise your work as much as possible and if your data isn‚Äôt falsifiable or can‚Äôt be replicated or has any minor flaw, then you have to fix the problem or start over again. <br><br>This is also why I stress the difference between data and the reading of data. It is a fact that Swedish people on average are more likely to have blue eyes than brown eyes but anything more than that can‚Äôt be inferred from this data. To reach further conclusions you need to go into the realm of statistical analysis, which can determine if comparing this data to other data is useful and if any correlation found is causation or coincidence. What is being defined as blue eyes can be the genes that cause it or the phenotype itself, but whatever the definition used is, it will always be shown on the paper so that the experiment can be replicated. <br><br>Even if for whatever reason the scientific method fails (if everyone somehow forgets about a confounding variable or something) not only would we know that we forgot something since it will fail in practice, but it will still be more correct than the absence of any data and thus there would be actual fact somewhere within the false data.<br><br>What real data anyone finds by confirmation bias is still factual, it‚Äôs just that any conclusions they make afterwards isn‚Äôt as trustworthy since they probably didn‚Äôt go through the scientific method to confirm it and may be forgetting a crucial compounding factor that could be in a paper that they don‚Äôt know about. If there is a clash between two views, we lay down all of the reasons why we hold our views and peer review each other to get closer to the truth, this is the essence of debating. Even though this usually isn‚Äôt as rigorous as actual peer reviewing, hearing the other person‚Äôs arguments would still at the very least give us more information about how the opponent thinks which can help us better convince others in the future to our view. <br><br>Even though some things are facts, there are still some things that we often treat as facts that aren‚Äôt. Even something like ‚Äúmurder is bad‚Äù isn‚Äôt a fact as the word ‚Äúbad‚Äù is subjective without further context. Instead something like ‚Äúhuman groups that agree that the murder of another human is bad tend to have on average better economic and standard of living indexes than human groups that don‚Äôt‚Äù is a fact. We think murder is bad for this reason (among others) so we assume that murder is objectively wrong, even though someone could say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the economy or the standard of living‚Äù or could have a disorder that makes them feel less empathy and thus could think murder is good. Despite our feelings on murder however, that won‚Äôt change the fact that societies that look down on murder tend to be better off by these metrics. These feelings that we think are objective but aren‚Äôt don‚Äôt have evidence for being objective so can be easily identified. Feelings are more like the blueprints of society that says what goes where while facts are the construction materials used. Whether the blueprints exist or not, the materials will still exist. <br><br>I at the very least think that the title ‚Äúfacts do care about your feelings‚Äù is misleading as it makes it sound like the laws of physics would change if we felt differently about them or that 2+2 would equal 5 if we adopt a different culture. These facts wouldn‚Äôt change, it would just be that we would be wrong, the world doesn‚Äôt suddenly become flat because a flat-earther thinks that it is.

 I&#39;ve always taken the quote to be that &#39;facts&#39; are the actual events that transpired; the burden is on us to find the facts. It isn&#39;t to say that facts &#39;don&#39;t care&#39;, but that the facts are incapable of caring.<br>So it is more accurate to say &#39;feelings don&#39;t care about certain facts&#39;, and if you converse with enough people about anything moderately contentious it will become immediately obvious that this is a fact among certain people. The question of course it whether it is better to lean into the flawed human nature or try and correct it. It&#39;s handy to know a source is biased when doing research, but only so far as meaning it is a source to be disfavored. If you&#39;re actually concerned about finding solutions for a problem this obviously becomes a problem.<br>I especially dislike Scientism which is writhe when it comes to contentious topics.<br><br>It could very well be the case that bias can&#39;t be removed entirely, but if so then it means we have been trying to fight bigotry and racism when it was impossible to change these things. I personally think we should be fighting those things in all forms (not just one side). Though it is animal nature, our modern societies show that we are capable of acting in a very unnatural ways if instilled in the correct manner (we just need to know the correct manner for removing bias, preferably without invasive brain surgery).

 I would highly recommend  the  book &quot;Don&#39;t Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking&quot; by Thomas E. Kida <br><br>I disagree with your comment that Shapiro, et. al. are not using facts.  I think that they are (sometimes) AND that you had it correct earlier.  They are using a SUBSET of the facts.  They are only using those facts which agree with their previously arrived at conclusion.  <br><br>BOTH sides must be aware of bias and a tendency to ignore inconvenient facts.  For example, while you dismiss crime statistics as racially biased (actually socio-economic), you presented no evidence that these statistics are not, in fact, accurate.  If robberies decreased by 23% because of police presence, then it does appear, on the surface, that the statistics are accurate and useful EVEN IF they lead to the conclusion that more crime occurs in poor neighborhoods.  Of course, HOW you respond to these facts are, again, dependent on your biases.  A conservative might call for even more police presence while a progressive might want more social programs like community centers.  It very much felt like you were dismissing these statistics (facts) because they do not fit YOUR worldview, the exact same thing Shapiro, et. al. are guilty of.....

 I really like the video on the two main point:<br>1) The science is fallible (This is an natural thing that all those educated in science know, but the general public does not) <br>2) The models created based in data depends on the data (much people misunderstanding probability).<br><br>Despite this, that no is the real answer to the phrase &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot;. The video really treats the fallible method to get facts and misunderstanding probabilities and place it to the level of objectivity beyond her initial condition, NOT, of the fact itself, the idea of fact, only treats fallible methods and subjective methods to approach the objectivity (the idea of objectivity). <br><br>In fact, I think the video really answers the sense of some groups of the internet, that if something has numbers then it is objective and the sense of we, as humans, have much more &quot;facts&quot; than we really know. (Really, we only have an approach to that, not the trust itself of many questions we have, especially in society and humanism).<br><br><br>In summary, the video handles several erroneous ideas that the public has regarding selecting &quot;truths&quot; (facts), causing them to make matters highly charged with humanity pass as truths, and treats these &quot;truths&quot;, false &quot;truths&quot; of the common public.

 After intense suspension of judgement due to the title of the video üòÖ, I can say I agree with most of it. But, a couple of major issues:<br>1. I think the title is a misnomer. From my understanding, the phrase &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; (which Ben Shapiro did not create; I&#39;ve known at least an approximation of this phrase long before hearing it said by Ben Shapiro) is intended to mean that <b>reality/truth does not defer to one&#39;s preferences</b> . Determining what exactly is <b>real</b> or <b>true</b> , as you&#39;ve rightly pointed out is an often complicated process for humans, that requires meticulous care and accountability. But by saying &quot;facts DO care about your feelings&quot; the implication (considering what I understand to be the original meaning of the phrase, and can confirm many people I personally know that use it actually mean) would be that truth/reality does in fact defer to one&#39;s own preferences. Since you disclaimed at the start of the video that you don&#39;t intend to argue for relativism, the title is effectively misleading.<br><br>2. I also agree with your definition of objectivity, being the acknowledgment of and strife to overcome our biases (our ability to recognize those biases depends on our exposure to a diversity of ideas). But this much is obvious to any intelligent person, as well as the fact that this is the <b>ideal</b> proper science aspires to be. Although, as you mentioned, too much of modern empirical discipline isn&#39;t nearly as transparent or accountable as it should be and is therefore not actually objective. Granted. When objectivity is done right, it is an act of humility and self-discipline, which is why it is a virtue. Research models and theories (like the referenced U.S. police-crime prediction map) may lack accuracy for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the lack of diversity of thought and failure to consider the nuances, subtleties and unknowns within specific fields (especially social fields for example). That is not to say all inaccuracies of research are attributable to bias,  empirical disciplines are also incomplete and developing; inaccurate assertions are inevitable (Furthermore, it&#39;s probably impossible to have an exhaustive awareness personal biases! Objectivity is an ideal, obviously no one is entirely objective). But I think the most productive way to redeem these models is to systematically expose their biases and present a truly rigorous alternative, or emphasize the subtleties and unknowns that need to be addressed. It is <b>destructive</b> to arbitrarily dismiss assertions based on a unsubstantiated assumption of bias...Perhaps unintentionally you stated at the end of the video that Ben Shapiro (who generally references his &quot;fact&quot; sources, making them available to cross-examination) isn&#39;t &quot;actually using facts&quot;, yet you never make an argument against the specific facts you are referring to. Falsity seems assumed. This can encourage the kind of impulsive rejection of well grounded assertions that seems to be increasingly popular in the modern mainstream, toward which many (if not all) people use <b>the phrase</b> as a rebuke.

 A big part of the problem with Shapiro&#39;s arguments in particular is that he says the word &quot;Fact&quot; when he means &quot;Argument&quot;. That the supposed basis of what he&#39;s claiming isn&#39;t based on evidence or even proven theorem, but just a conjecture based on his feeling about a statistic that very often is based on in facts but not somehow incontestable in the context that he wants to put on it.<br><br>In defense of police modelling there are a LOT of crimes happening in wealthy predominantly white neighborhoods but those crimes are difficult to catch and difficult to prosecute. Increasing patrol activity in an upper class white neighborhood isn&#39;t likely to deter an identity thief or an inside trader. Those criminals aren&#39;t likely to even meet a police officer if they&#39;re caught, much less notice if extra police cars are paroling their neighborhood. Poor Neighborhood crime is more often visible and it requires physical presence and police activity can have a greater influence in deterring it. There are worlds of possible improvement for how we police and even more so  how we reform criminals based on data bias but I feel that the focus of patrol cars should remain on the areas where vandalism and opportunistic violence happen.

 One issue though, on that whole &quot;crime statistic&quot; thing. It doesn&#39;t take a scientist, a statistician, an AI or an English professor to realize that poor areas are more susceptible to crime due to several factors (we can mention increased population density as one that would automatically increase crime, or the psychological fact that people who feel they do not have much feel they have less to lose, thus increasing their risk taking behavior). The point of the AI though still stands. Those areas are more prone to crime. It&#39;s not because the people there are worse or better, or that there is a certain prevalent ethnicity or culture present in the area. It is about the simple fact that you have a larger chance for someone to break the &quot;social contract&quot; in said area. It would thus make sense to increase the policing there. Also, I hope that the AI goes by reported crimes, not crimes solved, since that would defeat it&#39;s purpose. Police has to be where the problem is largest, not where their job is easiest.<br><br>That said - what would your suggestion be for that police chief? Spread the police force equally across the entire area of the jurisdiction, even though that would cause some officers working double shifts, while others would have nothing to do? Or simply let the officers go where their emotions take them? Pretty sure most of them would try and avoid the areas with too much crime, as even as police officers, they are humans - and humans will naturally attempt to avoid conflict.... (I realize the best strategy here is education and social interference in order to attempt to reduce the poverty in the areas in question - but that is hardly something a police chief can do, as it is not his job.)<br><br>The point you make is valid. We are all biased in our interpretation of facts. This doesn&#39;t make the facts squishy, it makes our opinions of them such. It&#39;s easy to say that the neighbourhood has a high crime rate because there are a lot of black people living there, but that is, as you yourself mentioned a bias of the speaker. Not of the fact. Another bias might be that the crime is caused by poverty and due to the lack of education offers to poor social groups it is hard for them to increase their wealth, thus no longer having the need to rely on crime. But the fact here is not the former, nor the latter statement - the fact is that the area has a high rate of crime, and that is what the AI says. The hows and whys are to be determined. <br><br>You shoot down Shapiro&#39;s logic well enough, and I honestly am not a fan of his myself - so my compliments on that - but you offer a picture with little nuance. Your presentation of facts seems to be people&#39;s opinions of facts rather than facts themselves, so when you say facts do care about your feelings, it is a truth with modifications. A mathematical, or an astrophysical function is a fact - and it really doesn&#39;t care. I could quote Gallileo Gallilei with his &quot;and yet it moves&quot;, as a historical reference to when the fact (of Earth moving around the sun) did not care, despite the opinions and feelings of the vast majority of the people who held him on trial.<br><br>Anyways, excuse the rant, by no means a defense of Shapiro, but rather a defense of the word &quot;fact&quot;, which I &quot;feel&quot; has been undeservingly reduced to a squishy pulp in this video.))))

Point is, it is an ever-evolving process - and while not flawless it has the advantage of being flexible enough to change - whereas &quot;feelings&quot; usually do not. (There&#39;s a bunch of literature on how people will stick to their own beliefs just to avoid admitting they are wrong - even though they are proven to be at fault time and time again.) As such, while methods might be wrong, they change (let&#39;s compare Alcmaeon&#39;s concept of humors to how today&#39;s medicine works), while emotional convictions and emotional biases stay the same. (People still think the Earth is flat - even though they are presented with evidence.)<br><br>Now, if I recall my post-modernism philosophy basics - they argue that <b>truth</b> is subjective, not that <b>facts</b> or *data&quot; are. This becomes a bit of a dialectic issue, as &quot;truth&quot; is something that flows out of &quot;facts&quot;, and is thus a bit more open to interpretation. This goes into the land of more emotionally colored argumentation, such as &quot;It is the truth that I am more likely to be robbed by a dark skinned person in the fair city of Oslo.&quot; (Which it is.) The fact inferred from that truth is that the person robbing me is doing so because of his skin color, which is false, at least to my knowledge. (No studies that correlate melanin levels to crime any more than lack of pirates is correlated to global warming.) In that way &quot;truth&quot; becomes an interpretation of &quot;facts&quot;, which ends up somewhere along the lines of the OP&#39;s video.<br><br>Methods and interpretations can both be biased, and I think the best point OP makes is that it is important to understand ones&#39; biases and question them. However, there is no fool-proof way to know whether your method is sound or not. For instance, as OP goes on to explain her point of view, it strikes me how little time she uses on questioning her own biases in this particular case. I mean, the logical thing here for her would be to ask herself of whether she herself has a bias towards what she calls facts. I am not saying that she does - but it is always healthy to entertain the possibility.<br><br>PS. I am very biased towards people and decisions made by the virtue of emotion rather than logic.

Yes police are focusing more on poorer areas, but if poorer areas are more likely to host a crime, particularly ones on the more serious side of the spectrum like burglary, then isn&#39;t that just smart policing. Has that not just made poorer areas a safer place to live? And given that being burgled is more likely to be economically devastating for a poorer individual or family, not using systems to reduce crime is kinda like you&#39;re just upping the number of poorer parts of the community getting burgled, or indeed any serious crime. <br><br>If the premise here is that the input data was inherently flawed because it included small crimes like recreational drug use, then sure, in that instance the model is deeply flawed. But if you were to focus the data down only to violent crimes, would the model not still find that poorer areas are host to more crimes? I would be surprised if poorer areas aren&#39;t more likely to have violent crimes. And if this is the case, the model isn&#39;t being influenced by our biases... At the point we might need to accept that it&#39;s just s reality of crime that they are more likely to be commited by poorer people, and poorer people are more likely to be the victims of crime.<br><br>Or if the argument is that sending police into poorer areas doesn&#39;t make those poorer areas safer, and there is a relatively high chance that innocent people get arrested or even killed because there are more police there, then our problem is not so much with models but with the quality of the police officers, the quality of their training, the kinds of people who choose (or are selected) to become police officers, or, if we are being honest, gun laws in America.

 You made a point about human beings having an inherent bias, but that isn&#39;t what facts refer to. <br>The interpretation of data is always biased, that is the entire idea of interpreting it in the first place, but a fact still stays the same. <br>Similarly, it is in the idea of scientific pursuit to acknowledge personal bias, but this does not mean that data is then immediately falsified by this personal bias. <br>The methods we  have come up with to create &quot;facts&quot; and keep objectivety make it so that we expect people to have different views, who will then try to prove or disprove given hypotheses. <br>And clearly verifiable numbers are either correct or false, if a person, due to personal agenda, falsifies the numbers, this does not mean there is now a &quot;personalised&quot; fact, it just means it&#39;s wrong, i.e. if a person were to say the number of immigrants in the US is around 47 million according to the UN in 2015, they would be right, the only way saying a different number would be correct would be by changing the definition of what constitues an immigrant, the fact itself does not care wether or not you like this number of immigrants however. It simply doesn&#39;t bother, or to say it differntly. The fact does not care about your feelings.

 From what you explained, facts don&#39;t care about your feelings, however feelings can direct the facts you use to prove your &#39;fact&#39;, this is true, it happens all the time and is why peer reviewing is so important in science as scientists build upon previous data and try to reenact experiments, i definitely agree on this point. However your use of the word &#39;fact&#39; seems to be a synonym with paradigm. In your example, the &#39;Fact&#39; is that more crime happens in poor neighbourhoods, however it doesn&#39;t mean the worst crimes happen there. The police use objective facts to build their paradigm, however they are selective on the facts they use. The fact is poorer neighbourhoods have more crimes, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the police use the best facts to create their paradigm. So the police model is not a fact on the best place to patrol, however, the data used is factual. The very definition of a fact is &quot;a thing that is indisputably the case&quot;. Maybe sometimes Ben Shapiro uses paradigms and not facts, but this is also wrong

In his life, he held the post of Professor of Classical Art and Architecture at Oxford, and he was appointed Regius Professor of Humanity (the Latin Professorship) at Aberdeen. He was knighted in 1906 to mark his distinguished service to the world of scholarship. Ramsay also gained three honorary fellowships from Oxford colleges, nine honorary doctorates from British, Continental and North American universities and became an honorary member of almost every association devoted to archaeology and historical research. <br>But long before all these accolades were heaped upon him, he was just another Oxford undergraduate, and an agnostic. He believed, as did most of his peers, that the gospel‚Äôs accounts of the life of Christ were mostly an accrual of mythology and legend. According to the thinking of the day, the gospels were written so long after the events they purported to represent, they had very little historic value. After graduation, Ramsay‚Äôs area of interest was the Asia Minor of the first century AD. He took with him a copy of Luke‚Äôs &quot;Acts of the Apostles,&quot; not because he thought it would be of much use, but because there were so few ancient travelers through that area of the world who recorded their experiences. He reasoned that although &quot;Acts&quot; was an obvious forgery, it still might have some tidbits of information that could shed some light on his discoveries. <br>He excavated throughout Greece and Turkey for over thirty years. He broke the ground in many of the ancient city sites. He excavated Ephesus, Iconium, Philippi, and many others. At the end of thirty years his opiniVon of Luke as an historian had undergone a dramatic reversal. He knew through firsthand discoveries that Luke was one of those individuals who were characteristically accurate in the information they presented. Ramsay made discovery after discovery that showed Luke was right and his critics mistaken. It got to the point that Ramsay found himself depending on Luke for interpretation of many of his finds. Also, as the evidence began coming in, Ramsay found it overwhelmingly in favor of an early first century date for &quot;Acts.&quot; As &quot;Acts&quot; is a continuation of the gospel of &quot;Luke,&quot; then &quot;Luke&quot; also had to have been written at about that time.Those two facts meant to Ramsay that Luke got his information from eyewitness sources, and also, the<br>early church, which was still filled with eyewitnesses, accepted Luke&#39;s gospel as an accurate biography of the Jesus Christ they had personally known. No serious historian suggests they were guilty of deception, they were enduring incredible persecution, precisely because of their belief in Jesus. They were certainly true believers. But what did they believe? While their memories conceivably could have been fuzzy about certain details of Jesus‚Äô life, it stretches credulity way past the breaking point to assume they were mistaken about the main point the gospels make, that Jesus Christ was the greatest miracle worker in recorded history, and that they had SEEN Him resurrected from the dead. <br>On the basis of those facts, Ramsay felt compelled to accept Jesus Christ as the gospels presented Him, the Son of God, the Savior, Who died on a Roman cross, paying for his, William Ramsay&#39;s sins, and Who rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Sir William Ramsay went to his death trusting this Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior from sin. Information gotten from ‚ÄúThe Bearing of Recent Discoveries on the Trustworthiness of the New Testament,‚Äù written by Sir William Ramsay. Are You Good Enough to go to Heaven? (The 10 Commandment Test) The Bible is supernatural in origin, therefore take heed to its promise of Heaven and warning of Hell. The Ten Commandments says ‚ÄúThou shalt not kill.‚Äù Have you ever murdered? If you have you are a murderer. It says ‚ÄúThou shalt not bear false witness.‚Äù Have you ever lied? If you have you are a liar. (Think:If one little murder would make you a murderer, then one<br>little lie makes you a liar.) It says ‚ÄúThou shalt not steal.‚Äù Have you ever stolen? Ever? Anything? If you have you are a thief. It says ‚ÄúThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain.‚Äù Have you ever used the name God or Jesus as cuss words. If you have you are a blasphemer. Jesus said that if we even look at someone with lust, we are adulterers at heart. Have you ever looked with lust? We have only looked at five of the commandments, yet if God were to judge you by the 10 commandments would you be innocent or guilty? If you have said yes to any of these questions, you are guilty and cannot stand before a holy God. Do you really think a Holy God is going to let murderers, liars, thieves, blasphemers and adulterers into heaven? The Bible says. ‚Äú. . . all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.‚Äù (Revelation 21:8) You desperately need a Savior.The Bible says: But<br>God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ, God the Son, died on the cross and paid for all your sins. The Bible teaches that He literally took the entire punishment that was coming to us for our sins, so that we could be forgiven and freely allowed into Heaven. He rose from the dead, and now wants to forgive you and save you from the sins that condemn you. He will give you a salvation that will not only forgive you, but it will turn you away from those sins that are destroying you. If you will repent of your sins, and trust Him for forgiveness and salvation, He promises: ‚ÄúBelieve (trust in, rely on, cling to) on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.‚Äù (Acts

 Read about 1800s and 1900s philosophy. That will totally shift your opinion. <br><br>The intellectual dark web goes much deeper than Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro. Nietzsche is the most popular, but there&#39;s a lot more that starts crossing into the realms of psychology and economics.

 Great video! I come from a statistical background, and data collection is the phase where we are more likely to get (closer to) objective data. The data collection phase is often the hardest and most expensive to perform properly. Big data (aka found data) often has biases, and even trying to identify all of the potential biases is often an impossible task. Big data does not mean good data. Critical judgement about the data quality is crucial for a proper analysis. Let me end by a quote from a statistician, Ronald Fisher:<br><br>To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.

But, facts as we could define it as things constructed in either smaller or larger groups by its members will never care about anyone feelings. Facts are abstract, the feeling towards them are varies but they will not care about your feeling towards. The individual or groups that creates facts may care about feelings of everybody. In case of trans people for an example. Ben knows that trans people is exist and so he tried to change its fact by telling trans people are wrong. <br>So maybe we can rephrase the sentence to &quot;people who creates facts may care about your feelings, but facts could not&quot;

 Sigh yea people have biases that is exactly why impartial methods are used  double blind research why peer review is needed and why studies need to be replicated the facts dont care about your feelings narrative maybe accurate the real issue is people whom are often claim to be objective aren&#39;t and that is true for people on all sides of the political spectrum. The solution is more not less objectivity. Our perception of facts is not reliant on feelings you have no evidence of this. You can have a distorted view of facts because of feelings but you can also access rationality as well otherwise all science and the concept of being impartial would not be possible that feelings CAN distort reason does not prove they inevitably will. And even when they do that is why we need to be more not less critical of findings so to expose and reduce bias

 Actually,facts do not care about your feelings,but your perception of facts is subjective,and your feelings are probably going to influence it.Perception is subjective,and that is,objectively,a fact.If you have 1 candy and you get another candy,you now have 2 candies,and you can&#39;t logically disagree on that,1+1=2 and there&#39;s nothing you can do to change it,however your perception of what just happened might differ from reality.Say for example you were extremely drunk when you got your 2nd candy,that&#39;ll affect your perception and you might think you got 5 candies,but in reality you didn&#39;t,just like your feelings can affect your perception of reality.All that facts care is about other facts and nothing else,for example: &quot;1+1=2&quot; and &quot;1+1+1+1=4&quot;,therefore &quot;2+2=4&quot; and if &quot;2*1=2&quot; and &quot;2*1=1+1&quot;,we can say &quot;2*2=2+2&quot; which is the same as &quot;2*2=4&quot;,because &quot;2+2=4&quot;.If you&#39;re onto something or haven&#39;t been taught math,your perception might tell you that the results are wrong,but in reality they&#39;re not.And yes,scientific research conclusions may be wrong,but if the conclusions are deconstruct into the facts used to reach them it&#39;s possible to prove them wrong,through facts,not through subjectivity.

 Not sure with my view here but shouldn&#39;t the video title be <br>&quot;Data DOES Care About Your Feelings&quot; because not all data are what you can consider as a fact because yes while the data shows something, it&#39;s still just an assumption based on the variables that were given. But in terms of facts. They really DON&#39;T care about anyone&#39;s feelings because whether you like it or not, The Earth isn&#39;t flat. Saying something is a fact just because of data isn&#39;t really what we can absolutely consider a fact. Maybe it could be a momentary fact OR maybe just an interpretation because we&#39;re trying to prove it with data but the statement &quot;Facts Don&#39;t Care About Your Feelings&quot;, in my opinion, means that absolute facts like the one I mentioned earlier will never change.

 &quot;Numbers cannot lie&quot;. That&#39;s where they go wrong, because statistics <b>do</b> have a small percentage of errors, because of natural variations and how probability works. There&#39;s a bigger chance of error if they have a small group of test subjects. Look at a large enough sample of research into the same topic, and some of them will confirm the false hypothesis, simply by chance. Cherry-pick those, and voila, you are &quot;backed by science&quot; and yet completely wrong. That&#39;s why scientific consesus is more important than an individual paper! If there&#39;s one paper saying &quot;this thing is A&quot; and a bunch saying &quot;this thing is B&quot;, the single paper claiming it&#39;s A isn&#39;t the &quot;only brave one going against the grain, the sole torch of truth&quot;, just a product of how statistics works. Sadly, it makes a good narrative and can be told, but it&#39;s a dishonest one, preying on how the average person doesn&#39;t understand statistics deep enough. And not of their own fault, but because those at the top aren&#39;t interested in having people actually seeing through their statistics cheats.<br><br>The only branch of science where anything can be absolutely certain is mathematics, because it doesn&#39;t study the material world but starts with axioms and then builds on those. In physics, you can corroborate something 100 times, but there&#39;s no guarantee it won&#39;t happen differently on the 101st time. But there&#39;s a good chance it won&#39;t, so we accept the observed behavior as a law of physics, *until proven wrong*. Newton&#39;s laws of gravity were considered &quot;the truth&quot; or &quot;the facts&quot; until Einstein came along and showed that yes, that&#39;s a very very good approximation under our normal circumstances, but there&#39;s more to gravity. And maybe one day we&#39;ll discover there&#39;s even more to it. Physics can just never be absolute. Consider biology or psychology, and things get even more murky...

 &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; was there long before Shapiro. Millenia. This is a point against the appeal to emotions fallacy. With that said, there&#39;s something called biases. Belief bias, confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect, etc. These will cause someone, who isn&#39;t careful and self aware, to believe as fact opinions fueled by feelings. This is why the scientific method and similar methods include peer review, to compare notes between people with different biases. The more people do that, the less biases poison it. This is what we get as close to facts as possible. It&#39;s not reaching truth, it&#39;s looking for what&#39;s likely to be true.<br><br>Nice outline of the data input problem with models. This is why models should be based on predictive hypothesis to be tested. We need to know the cogs in the model, after all. <br><br>The infallibility of scientists is indeed an appeal to (true) authority fallacy. Consensus doesn&#39;t give us what&#39;s true but the best we have to get as close to truth as possible, given our current data.

So they had the &quot;facts&quot;, which was the physical findings they found through archaeology, but they wanted to fill the gaps, so &quot;X&quot; historian would make an assumption, &quot;We have this armor, which is apparently heavy, so there was no way knights could get on top of a horse on their own, so they must have used a sort of crane to mount a horse&quot; (actual thing they believed) but there was no proof for that claim. But a second historian, would make another assumption, and cite that first historian as the source, and then a third, and so on and on. Until it was believed as fact because it was the consensus, but it was all circular logic. There was never any proof for knight having to use a crane to get on top of a horse.<br>Today&#39;s historians use several methods to test their hypothesis, including experimental archaeology which is them trying it with the tools they know they had on those times. So now people having armor tailored for the person, they know that a well fitted armor barely restricts any movement, and they can even do acrobatics on said armor. That plus the fact that there is no depiction of a crane ever used to assist a knight, we can be sure they mounted their horses on their own without much trouble. <br>So the point I am trying to make, is that the more we test the hypothesis through multiple angles, people, studies from different cultures and geographical location, we can achieve a more objective view. But true, our biases can still affect the interpretation of those results. So not saying that using only those studies is a good thing, but I am saying that those studies are now more objective than those of the past, thanks to more rigorous methods and peer review. Again not perfect, just better.', 'Tyler Breau', '@Henrique Pacheco You make a good point but that just goes into importance of being skeptical. The interpretation of facts and presentation of facts can change facts into something that is not a fact and because of that you need to be skeptical of the information that is a proposed fact.<br>Being skeptical needs to happen when both receiving the presentation and interpretation of a supposed fact.<br>Ultimately being skeptical in this context means to question it and to take time in your questioning so that you do not make rash decisions.<br><br>I&#39;d say this more falls in line with &quot;However, it is of value to take this thought into consideration in order to reflect and introspect on our own internalized biases.&quot;<br>This also falls in line with peer reviewing, comparing notes, etc. <br><br><br>My full thoughts on this are available in another comment on this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;lc=Ugz_OR_S9xVWshJwNDZ4AaABAg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;lc=Ugz_OR_S9xVWshJwNDZ4AaABAg</a>']

 Facts are a good thing; they are a great thing, even. Two points however: one is that feelings are a fact of humanity and so therefore deserve inclusion when discussing humanocentric concepts and goals and ideals. Second, the reason conservatives (especially) harp on the idea that only leftist losers care about feelings, in reality, is that conservatives rarely utilize facts at all; instead they almost universally make simple appeals to emotion on the topic du jour. IOW, it&#39;s just typical projection on their part in order to keep others off-balance and defensive, rather than allowing (or accepting rather) an  assertively stated rational argument.

The model tells you that crimes like burgurlaries are higher in pooer, minority neighborhoods- fine.  What do your cops DO when they go on patrols there?  Do they interact with the people living there, get to know who&#39;s who, and themselves, by name?  Ask around for people to volunteer information?  Talk to the kids on the ball court?  Or do they go in with the expectation to &#39;bag a perp&#39;, seeing everyone in a geographical area as a potential criminal,  stop and frisk, and escalate any minor confrontation into an arrest or assault, because, hey, he might be dangerous- that&#39;s what the model says.<br>What we do with facts depends on how we feel about such facts, and how we feel about facts will determine which ones we focus on.

 I have a very big problem with the argument made in the video.<br><br>Science should be distinguished from studies, because even though they overlap in quite a few places, those are different fields of the academic world, and you were quite frequently using them wrong.  Sciences are the fields that are studying natural phenomena, like physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics (to some degree), geology, etc. Studies are the fields that are studying cultural/group phenomena, like social or behavioral studies (even ethology, which focuses on animal behavior), history, and so on, with the unique in-between field of psychology.<br><br>The main difference is actually how these fields interpret their facts. Science has a more empirical way to prove facts. It says that based on a thesis you can design an experiment and predict the outcome. This also means that this experiment can be conducted over and over again and you&#39;d have the same results. And this is because you can control the environment of the experiment with an accuracy big enough to say that not considered impacts are negligible (thus you can repeat the experiment). And for a thesis to be validated they actually have to conduct many experiments and also check previous ones that were validated.<br><br>What happened after the enlightenment era is that because of its achievements in science we thought that the world can be described perfectly by it, making science the ultimate philosophy and they didn&#39;t make the distinction between science and studies, and in the late 19th century and even in the first half of the 20th century they thought that the rules of evolution present in most fields in science were completely applicable on human societies, and they even crafted theories like social Darwinism, which was the root of nazi ideology. I know that there were a lot of other factors, but you can&#39;t mention all of them in a comment.  But the fallout of social Darwinism and world war 2 was that we realized what your argument was, that many academical fields don&#39;t have an empirical method of research. And where you go wrong is that there is a very big literature on how to rank different studies, how to try and purify them from the bias of the ones conducting them, and on overall requirements of a good study.<br><br>To talk a little about the method it is somewhat similar to anthropological methods. We conduct as much quality research as possible and see the results. They might tend to point in a direction, or they might be contradictory. So we conduct even more quality research. This way we end up having more and more evidence, and if an overwhelming majority of the evidence at hand points to a conclusion, we state that as a fact, but it&#39;s never claimed that it&#39;s empirical, just that it&#39;s solid.<br><br>I would&#39;ve liked to have an in-depth analysis of Ben Shapiro&#39;s debates, where you debunked how his statements weren&#39;t facts because what happens on many of these, especially the ones on college campuses is that they actually discuss the data and the studies behind it. This is an actual academic discussion. What you actually did is that you took one phrase out of context (it doesn&#39;t matter that it became a catchphrase, it had a context) and created a straw man out of it at which you ended up shooting.

 I really enjoyed this video and agree with what you are saying.  I&#39;m a graduate student in geology, and the way I think about science is that it is the collective endeavor to generate narratives about reality that are accurate enough to be useful but simple enough to be understandable. In my field of geology for example, one can&#39;t perceive at a granular level, let alone hold in one&#39;s mind the absolute reality and history of a landscape; one collects and uses a set of observations and interpretations to tell a story about what a landscape is and how it came to be that way. That interpretation is my favorite part of research, where you bring together all of the complex and discordant information that you have so painstakingly collected and connect it together into a coherent narrative.

 Ok that&#39;s nice and all, but I&#39;m pretty sure objectivists are interested in <del>actual</del> facts.

Still, those aren&#39;t facts then, if they&#39;re wrong. and even if they are, they&#39;re still way more objective than people who base their worldview off emotional arguments or political correctness.<br><br>You used a bunch of examples here of systems that aren&#39;t inherently objective due to being based on outdated data, (like google maps, - everyone knows google maps isn&#39;t updating constantly so it can be inaccurate) but the alternative to NOT using statistics and data to understand something is guessing, or going by intuition, aka feelings, and that&#39;s just ultimately going to be less truthful than objectivism, even if objectivism isn&#39;t perfect.<br><br>That said, Shapiro is a hack because for someone who believes in facts so much, he sure does like to let his religion dictate how he feels about certain topics.

 I honestly LOVE that you&#39;re going to talk about stories. Because you&#39;re right! I&#39;ve worked in data. And with really high-level data about difficult-to-quantify things that aren&#39;t just KPIs. And through the entire video, my thoughts were drawn back to conversations I had at work. Whenever we looked at a new dataset, whenever we had a dashboard to make or analyses to write, we would say openly: What is the story we&#39;re trying to tell? What is the story here? Because until it&#39;s been interpreted, it&#39;s just data. It becomes information when we put a perspective/lens on it.<br><br>One of the clearest examples of this was a simple survey we had to classify. There was a question about satisfaction - are you very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, satisfied, or very satisfied? Classic likert scale. The problem came when we had to graph satisfaction. Where do you put neither satisfied nor dissatisfied? If you say they&#39;re not NOT satisfied and put them in the &quot;satisfied&quot; category, we&#39;re making a BIG assumption. Same with saying that they&#39;re dissatisfied because they&#39;re not satisfied. And even just removing them from this pool is not the correct solution, because doing that reduces the power, and means this specific figure cannot be relied on to the same level as the others in the paper, because the sample size is smaller.<br><br>Point is, data is hard and messy, you shouldn&#39;t trust any figure outright, and ALWAYS ask yourself &quot;what story are they trying to tell?&quot;<br><br>Amazing video, can&#39;t wait for the next one.

 I choked on my tea a bit at the part about climate change. Truth be told, I did come across people denying climate change in such a manner, but it is  in pure and blunt contradiction to scientific facts, making their argument kind of weird and self defeating. It&#39;s even stranger to consider that Shapiro is openly religious and that religion is playing a big role in his world view, even when facts are against him.<br><br>That&#39;s hat so strange with this tho. Claiming to have the facts on your side while it is obviously not true, it&#39;s almost too big. But Shapiro is more of a mediatic effect than anything else, his lack of understanding of science and epistemology is very obvious and people following him are, unsurprisingly, also pretty ignorant on those matters.

 Amazing analysis, Zoe. I couldn&#39;t agree with you more about the fans of the so called Dark Web intellectuals.  The majority tend to be incurious in nature.  They go by faith rather then even common sense.  They are singular in their vision of perception.  It takes empathy and curiosity to view the concept of &quot;fact&quot; in a more open and diverse thought process.  When you give up your own free will to the mindset of another where does that leave you as a thinking human being?  The great American Jewish writer Elie Wiesel once said:  &quot;We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.<br>The opposite of love is not hate, it&#39;s indifference.&quot;  These words speak profoundly not only about virtues, or lack there of, of human individualism.  It is a core principle that binds us to Truth.  It can also be an interpretation of our relationship to the Truth.  We are fallible, yes, but we are also ignorant by choice.  There is more to the truth, but it takes a good heart, a mindful curiosity, and an openness to view it objectively without prejudice.  Without...indifference.  Thank you for the video.

 You are certainly thinking in the right direction, but you miss so much. <br><br>Aside from that, you misunderstood the point of the phrase &quot;facts don&#39;t care about feelings.&quot; The point is that people can&#39;t rely on their emotions to understand truth, and that taking only emotionally comfortable ideas as truth will only result in expectations that simply can&#39;t ever be met. For example, gender is a combination of biology and social construction, and on the biology side, if you have male plumbing, you can&#39;t get pregnant regardless of social construction, social acknowledgement, and certainly not because one feels like they can.

 Shapiro is often a hypocrite, it is true! I seriously dislike some of his opinions. On the other hand I respect his swagger and have enjoyed listening to him speak. It is a shame that many of his fans are not critical thinkers and that the cultural environment has evolved into the tribalism it has because on some issues he has valuable things to say, and i know it is elitist of me but it seems like large numbers of his followers lack the capacity to discern for themselves what those things are. As for JP... I&#39;d say that he has much more of value to say than BS. Nothing particularly groundbreaking... but valuable nonetheless. I watched all of his Harvard lectures, initially looking for signs of controversial opinions as touted by the media. I was thoroughly disappointed in that respect but pleasantly surprised by the non controversial content of his lectures. What I found to be astonishing was the amount of hate directed at him... literally thousands of people queueing up to insult the guy wherever he was mentioned and 99% of the time these criticisms were just plain wrong, like people were just repeating things they&#39;d heard just to get in on the action while having done no research whatsoever... I&#39;d not seen anything like it and it kinda blew my mind to the point where I found myself defending him in comment threads. I was nowhere close to being a fanboy but this was just unfair. If the media had left him alone he would not have found anyway near the amount of supporters that he ended up with. Like I said, there was nothing particularly groundbreaking in his work... just well presented, well researched, run of the mill psychology stuff... (I&#39;m no academic, by the way! the reaction to him really did change the way I viewed the media and it was pretty disturbing. One of his lecture series was, if I recall correctly, about the importance of stories in culture and the psychological role of archetypes.

 I understand your argument about the idea that bad input will create bad output no matter how good the model, but I think you are straw-manning the other side. if we know in what way the input was bad (like the severity of the crime) could we not just correct for it (by per se excluding non-violent offenses). And specifically for the crime example given, I understand that even if you exclude the non-violent crimes, what about the impact of racism on the conviction rates of violent crime and all of the other parts of our justice system that make justice unjust. But what if police stations took the most liberal estimates for all of those injustices, and corrected for them in the input, then plugged that into this perfect model of crime prediction. Wouldn&#39;t that produce a reasonable output?

 This argument sickens me in it&#39;s bad faith. Yes, it is true that humans are fallible. Some are even unethical. And yet intellectually honest, ethical scientists out number the bad eggs who get the attention. These people are meticulous in their work, check for variables that they may have missed, and make sure not to manipulate the numbers to get the results they want. For the most part scientists are drawn to their work by their passion for discovering the cold hard truth.<br><br>Anyone familiar with the scientific method knows that current scientific knowledge should not be equated to reality. Everything is just a working theory which may well be disproven by further research. The whole point is to check and recheck. Constantly improve the model as more information comes to you. Working theories are important since we can&#39;t push pause on the world while we work out the truth. We go with our best knowledge and are flexible as new discoveries are made. This was the gift of the Enlightenment.<br><br>Scientists are doing their best to bring us closer to the truth and a better world. Dumping on all their work because of some mistakes is horrible. In fact this is a logical fallacy which I would hope an English professor would be familiar with: proof by example. You need to separate the bad from the good and not throw out the baby with the bathwater.<br><br>I came here wanting to hear a good argument against Schapiro since I find him truly annoying and biased.

 Data is NOT dependent on feelings. I think i get what you are arguing. but i think you&#39;re formulating it wrong. Just because someone decides to draw some conclusions from statistics that serve their own political ideology doesn&#39;t mean that the data is wrong. Either it&#39;s wrong or it&#39;s not. If some IQ test shows a disparity among a certain groups of people it doesnt mean it&#39;s wrong even if the people behind it is extremely racist. Data does not care about feeling but you can present certain data in a way that makes you feel good. This is what the left and the right does when parts of their ideology makes no sense or are just outright lies. They pick a statistic that kind of resemble the subject and make wild conclusions.

 Many people conflate the words &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot;. A fact is an objective truth of reality and knowledge is the information a person has about a fact. We can not know any fact directly, we can only have knowledge about a fact. <br>While a fact is a property of reality that exist indenpendently from humans, knowledge is a state of the human brain, a memory associated with a fact. Human brains are fallible and influenced by emotion, therefore any knowledge we have is also prone to error and influenced by emotion. This means any thought, judgement, knowledge or statement about any fact is always influenced by the errors of the brain. <br>Facts themselves are not influenced by feeling, but every conversation, book, graph, thought or memory we have of them is.

 Great video but the I don&#39;t know what to think about the example with the policing model. I understand that it is a good example of how biases can get into model predictions but I don&#39;t understand how you can possibly spin it to make it sound like it&#39;s a bad thing that the results were more police in the areas with more crime. Are there studies that say that these model results are wrong and that there is actually more crime in other areas? If so then why not mention that? You mention that small time crime is more common in poorer areas, does that mean that police miss more serious crimes that are more common in other areas? Of course you can argue that more police to poor areas is not the best way to decrease crime rates but it doesn&#39;t seem like that is what you are doing in this video. It kinda seems like you say that the model resulted in more policing in poor areas which lead to fewer burglaries, and that is a bad thing for the sole reason that it confirmed what racist people would predict.

 Meh, some of these things are problematic.  For example - Sam Harris is not known for controversial views that contradict established science.  It is careless to throw him in with Shapiro and Peterson whom you seem to describe accurately, but miss the mark with Harris.  Harris is known more for wadding into controversial topics and not necessarily agreeing 100% with the easiest answer - which is a much different thing from Shapiro and Peterson who regularly contradict well established science.<br><br>The first thing to understand then is that math absolutely does represent objective knowledge.  1+1=2 as an objective fact, by definition.  There is no rational space to dispute this fact.  This contradicts Gaukroger.  The easiest place/way to show that Gaukroger is wrong is to consider F=MA (Newton&#39;s Second Law).  If there was any possibility that this reductionist law could be anything less than pure objective fact, then we could not build buildings, we could not build airplanes, and the computer you are using right now could not work.  Gaukroger&#39;s position is as absurdly bad as anything we get from Shapiro and Peterson.  It is a frighteningly bad position.<br><br>Math itself is objectively correct and factual by definition, but its application to models can be wrong - which of course is where &quot;garbage in - garbage out&quot; comes from.  I think most of the video is just explaining &quot;garbage in - garbage out,&quot; that mathematical models can be wrong and can be applied wrong, but the video incorrectly contradicts the underlying fact that math itself is still objectively correct by definition.<br><br>A better source for explain the failing of models is going to be Nate Silver&#39;s: The Signal and the Noise.  Yes models fail.  Expect models to fail.  However, some models cannot fail.  Typically those models are very simple like the Newton&#39;s Second Law case.  This true dichotomy is what confuses some people.  Some well established mathematical models cannot fail - other models can fail and should be expected to fail.<br><br>One last thing to agree about - outside of math &quot;facts&quot; are only what we agree they are.  If we agree the sky is blue it is a fact.  If someone disputes it - it is no longer a fact.

 Crime data only shows us the crimes that were observed.  It&#39;ll never tell us to look somewhere we haven&#39;t looked before.  And how do we calculate the &#39;most&#39; crime?  Crime has no inherent numerical value.  Do we choose to assign value by cost in dollars, or the impact to human life?  Or by legal categories?  Is one felony equal to four misdemeanors?  Or five?

 As a person who spends most of their professional time working with mathematical models, I&#39;m baffled that people associate models with impartiality. <br>First of all the whole point of making a model is to make simplifications from assumptions. If I didn&#39;t want to make simplifications I wouldn&#39;t use a model, I would just do the real thing I&#39;m supposed to model. What are the simplifications? Well, I assume (and sometimes test) what can and cannot be simplified. How do I know I&#39;m right? I don&#39;t, unless I validate my model.<br>Secondly, what am I doing a model of? The thing I want to do may times in an effective manner. What that thing is is up to me. If I want to find out if a new plane wing works, than I model that in a certain way. This doesn&#39;t answer the questions: why do I need this new plane wing? Who would use the plane wing for what purpose? Is it a good idea to make this plane wing? These are all subjective questions which are based on judgement, morals, worldviews, etc.

 There was a fantastic TED talk I had to watch for one of my classes that talked about algorithms and confirmation bias. An algorithm is only as good as what you give it. When FOX news made an algorithm for hiring based on which people had succeeded at the company in the past in an effort to combat sexism in the hiring process. It still only hired men - not because the men were inherently more qualified, but because all the data (the people who had succeeded in the past) was taken from men, so the algorithm filtered out the women because, well, none had succeeded at the company before. It‚Äôs a huge ethical issue in the field of computer science, especially because people do see the algorithms we make as objectively true. Yeah, it is objectively true for the data you fed it, but that sample may not be representative of the whole population.

 Well, the problem is &quot;how do we interact with reality&quot;? There are so many different possible understandings of it, that it is almost impossible, to properly interact with it. We humans see color, so is the world made up of objects having color? Which colors? There are people that are colorblind. There are animaly that don&#39;t see color as we do. Is color perception now an objective reality or a subjective reality? An objective reality with subjective aspects?<br>Also how do we interact with language? One of the biggest problems of science in my opinion is language. As in gedern, there are so many aspects gender can be differentiated by: Chromosomes, genitalia, reproductive organs, hormones, breasts, etc. That aside there are also social aspects.

 A note about the crime policing model point. Mathematicians can adjust for the expected crime rate using the current policing rate.

 I&#39;m confused by your police crime model argument. How is what you described bad input? Because more crime happens in poor neighborhoods, should the police not spend more time in poor neighborhoods? And if more crime is stopped/mitigated in some way, is this not a positive? It seems to me that you may be using the idea of police arresting poor people as an argument against police arresting criminals. If a criminal is poor, does it make them less a criminal?<br><br>Now it&#39;s been shown that poverty begets crime. I believe there are more productive ways to reduce crime that to simply &quot;arrest all the criminals and send them to jail&quot; such as lifting people out of poverty through education, rehabilitation from drug use, mental health treatment, providing jobs and infrastructure through community enrichment, etc.<br><br>However I don&#39;t necessarily follow that crime happening more often in poor neighborhoods is bad data. Or that the result, police patrolling impoverished communities, a bad result. It seems that you&#39;re implying more than what you&#39;re saying.

 what makes me really mad about this statement that Ben Shapiro operates only with facts and logic, that it is in the scientific community actually widely acknowledged by now that facts (especially their interpretation as well as connecting some of them to a theory) and logic (because of circular reasoning and assumptions) both have pretty big flaws and are not this super objective things but very much like you said influenced by your subjective opinion and that the only way to handle this is to constantly reflect on this fact while you researching.

 The climate change issue in particular is such a clear example of projection... it only takes the simple thought experiment of &quot;what is more potentially disturbing to human feelings, the idea that we are not affecting the climate and causing a bad future, or the idea that our current way of life is causing harm and needs to change?&quot;, and any reasonable, objective person will see what is going on. Regardless of all other factors, it is obvious that the more emotionally problematic idea is that our current way of life is harmful and must change. This is not debatable in good faith in any way... and yet so many are unable to step back and see simple truths like that, and instead are actually swayed by the opposite argument, simply because it aligns with what they would naturally prefer to feel, without even noticing the irony, hypocrisy, and projection inherent in their entire argument.<br><br>The longer I am alive, the more clear it is how nearly every single argument or accusation from a right-wing perspective is one or another form of projection. They cannot imagine other perspectives, in other words, lack the capacity for rational sympathy, and can only accuse others of the evils they are familiar with internally, ie prejudice, blind belief systems, hate for its own sake, censorship, violence, authoritarianism, corruption and criminality, and on and on.

 As someone in the data science field, one prevalent problem is that data-focused people tend to be biassed toward quantitative outcomes, which makes them ignore qualitative outcomes.

 Well, but &quot;what you think the facts are or which specific facts you know about depends on your feelings&quot; isn&#39;t really the same as facts caring about your feelings. What Ben Shapiro is stating is just the principle that there is an objective reality independent of us. Never mind the irony that he absolutely is awful at then evaluating that by separating it from his own personal feelings, that&#39;s the core thing. Climate change is an obvious example of a situation where it&#39;s absolutely true: facts don&#39;t care about our feelings. Sadly, people like Ben are letting themselves be overwhelmed by their feelings with regards to it, and in doing so they&#39;re making our response to the problem slower, and people will die because of it. But that is the ultimate consequence of ignoring the existence of a world independent of you and unaffected by your internal state of mind (unless translated into action, of course). At some point, it might just come back like a hammer and hit you in the face.

 The point of &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; isn&#39;t that things that are claimed to be facts aren&#39;t influenced by feelings, but that what&#39;s actually true isn&#39;t and that using feelings as an argument isn&#39;t conducive to finding truth. I disagree with Ben Shapiro on many things, and believe he uses motivated reasoning quite often, he likes to exclaim that facts don&#39;t care about your feelings but bases his own opinion on feelings, he uses the phrase as an argument tactic instead of a way to reflect on his own beliefs. It is impossible to completely seperate feelings from our fact finding process, partly because without feelings we wouldn&#39;t have a reason to know anything. It is however very valid to point out when someones argument is based on feelings, the motivation for an argument will always be based in feelings but the argument itself shouldn&#39;t be. I also find it weird to present anything as the position of &quot;The Intellectual Dark Web&quot; as they are not as a group defined by their beliefs, it contains people on the left and on the right, they will have divergent thoughts on almost any subject. You brought up both Shapiro and Sam Harris, one of which is an orthodox jew and uses that as his basis for his world view while the other has made his career largely by critiquing religion.

 I dont want to write too long, and I dont even think you will respond (or see this), but... I think the points you&#39;re raising are not what Ben or his &quot;fellows&quot; are talking about. <br>For the record, I do agree with you in what you are saying, specially the notion that we have biases, and in this context, EMOTIONAL biases, including in scientific studies. I can&#39;t recall now, but I remember reading about how we even choose emotionally our studies fields. Anyway....<br>The point that Ben and his fellows are raising are (I think) that Nature does not bend to our emotions. Like, the Sun will not take longer to shine a new day, just because we are sad or depressed. Yes, it will take longer in a Winter day, but not because we feel, but for the natural order of things. <br>Sorry for talking too much, it&#39;s just the way I think...

 To me, we should strive to be more like the Romantics, who were full of passion -- as opposed to the Enlightenment movement that stressed scientific thought and logic above emotion and the human condition. They both seem to be extremes, but some middle ground on a level of practicality is possible. If we want to talk facts, then we must admit that humans are inherently flawed beings, prone to our overreactions, and ever fearful of the consequences. Objectivity is nothing without its flourishes. Just read Darwin. He wrote with mindfulness, and made his words appeal specifically to the sensibilities of the time he was writing -- without needing to dumb down what he was saying or speak above his audience. Thing is Darwin&#39;s theories on evolution and the Origin of Species are still highly contested today. Fact met with &#39;feelings&#39; of the religious zealots who still for some reason think even Harry Potter and D&amp;D are the works of the devil. My point is there needs to be a good balance. Although I have my &#39;camp&#39;, so to speak, I know I can&#39;t fall fully into the idea that emotion can exist without its logical counterparts. Humans must be able to check themselves in the face of bias, and likewise not let their judgment be clouded. But they must also not be so overly-logical that they eschew all notion of the more chaotic, unruly, and honest sides of what makes us human. We&#39;re walking contradictions. Why can&#39;t our &#39;facts&#39; be so as well? It&#39;s impossible to be truly, 100% unbiased anyway.

 I disagree with some definitions but the result is the same... The problem isn&#39;t that &quot;facts do care about your feelings&quot; but rather that humans are too subjective or biased to actually know all the facts in all situations. If we could actually be 100% sure that the facts we know are full and actually objective then yes, &quot;facts would not care about feelings&quot; indeed, but since we are too flawed to think like that, then all we can do is to question our opinions all the time.

 If I understand you correctly, you say that anything is subjected to one&#39;s own feelings and no statement can be truly objective. Including your statement and the whole video. So your argument undermines itself. However I agree with you that the scientific findings are flawed, their presentation too often lacks needed context.

 Not going to watch the full video (no offense) not because im a ben fan boy, but because i&#39;m genuinely not interested in ben drama anymore, I gave up on watching the dude years ago. But he is right when he says &quot;facts dont care about your feelings&quot;<br><br>if 2 + 2 = 4  then it doesn&#39;t matter if it makes you sad, it&#39;s always going to be 4. There are some things in life that are undeniable facts, and to many people try to change that purely because it &quot;hurts their feelings&quot; which is what made ben started saying that, out of retaliation towards people who try to change facts over it &quot;makes me feel sad&quot;. that being said where ben is honestly quite annoying is he is blatantly wrong about a lot of things he says, but wants to pretend he is this all-mighty always right person. So it&#39;s pretty obnoxious to have someone who is wrong a lot of times say this quote. But over all no fact&#39;s dont care about your feelings, the truth is the truth, some things can be debated opinions but there is some things that can never be opinion based for facts are facts. <br><br>A good example where this quote is important is lets say your favorite celebrity was a rapist, and raped a little girl or murdered his wife. But because you love that celebrity so much you did everything you could to support him while denying the facts, which causes him to live a comfortable life and even get away with it. Don&#39;t pretend it doesn&#39;t happen it&#39;s called OJ simpson and R Kelly<br><br><br>This is why we can&#39;t let our feelings shadow us away from the actual facts. The quote is about having self-control over your feelings to accept the undeniable truth in life even if you don&#39;t like it. <br>Honestly, I feel Ben started off good, but then over all became way to egotistic taking on topics he doesn&#39;t know enough about and is factually wrong on. <br><br>Anyways your video is probably good and has a lot of research, but I just wanted to comment on the title.

(Interpreters can care about feelings at least.) You can always select the best interpretation for a given set of data, and you can always iterate in if new data is presented. Demanding self-consistency and deriving identical results from different principles are tools strong enough to filter almost all BS. Also, this whole approach of yours (like most of today&#39;s narrative) lacks any utility. You should be thinking in terms of objectives, steps to take to achieve them, and the evaluation of those steps.

Coz the next year all that red dots on the map will be less red, less crime to be reported, less data input in the &quot;big data&quot; machine.  And thats why in scince they publish not only the results , the conclusion, but the methodology too. And that why Ben Shapiro cites his sources too.  So you can go and check the studies yourself.

 Not all facts are dictated by feeling or even persuaded by them. That&#39;s a mischaracterization of &#39;facts&#39;. <br><br>Talking about statistical/data analysis as &quot;facts&quot; just convolutes the argument imo. Facts aren&#39;t always impacted by our feelings or implicit biases - definitely analysis can be - but I don&#39;t believe that someone like Shapiro makes truly objective arguments in the first place. He definitely has a certain ideology that he&#39;s trying to argue for, and uses certain facts to support that, as do almost all of us do ... but that doesn&#39;t deny the validity of the statistic or fact that he uses, because even if it is ruled by some implicit bias in the case of a statistic, it still exists as actual, real data that is actually happening, regardless of biases. The perception of that data is to be considered, though ... like for the police data, it doesn&#39;t deny that those areas are more likely to have crime ... but what does it actually mean to have crime in those areas? And why is the conclusion that they need more policing, or that it&#39;s the most effective way of reducing crime? Whenever stats are involved, most debates end up in that area between objectivity and subjectivity. But that&#39;s the nature of some of these issues, especially involving humans. Anyone who deals with Big Data knows that human data is almost always subjective or at least incomplete. You can track how many times people open up their cellphone in a day, and that will tell you one variable but it won&#39;t tell you why they&#39;re doing it. There&#39;s some stuff - like human will - that can&#39;t be wrapped in a nice, statistical bow.<br><br>I do agree with most of the things you&#39;ve said in the video, I&#39;m just saying &quot;not all facts&quot;; not all of our reality/understanding is based off of subjective, implicit biases and feelings...

 Your cats are so damn cute.<br><br>I have a question: if the problem with the model is that it concentrates on poorer neighborhoods where milder crimes are committed, wouldn&#39;t yet another model smooth things out, say, by having a scoring system for targeting only more &quot;important&quot; crimes?<br><br>Even if the input data is still corrupted due to arresting more people from a specific place initially, isn&#39;t the whole problem, in a way, saying &quot;you&#39;re arresting more criminals from this place than another one&quot;, so it&#39;s ultimately working? If reducing officer&#39;s bias eventually worked and only guilty people got arrested (or, even better, only people caught in the act), it seems to me that concentrating on poorer neighborhoods would even be an advantage for them, since they would be safer that way, while places not targeted would still have problems.

 Another thing I would add is that feelings are highly involved in the actions that create our reality and the facts. For example: if people feel like elections don&#39;t change anything, they will not vote and therefore shape reality. If people feel like a vaccine is or isn&#39;t safe, they will act accordingly and therefore shape reality. If students in school feel capable of learning something new it will influence their motivation, confidence and willingness to study and therefore shape the way their life might plan out.<br>Emotions aren&#39;t this funny weird little thing in our heads that is completely seperate from the &quot;real world&quot;.

The models taught as basic chemistry/physics is not accurate to our current understanding of atoms, but they give sufficient knowledge for what most people need, yet one wouldn&#39;t go to a scientist and argue from that simplified model. Same with basic biology and trans people and other variables. Personally I think the issue is that basic biology is a little too basic considering how it has affects on real people, unlike the simplified model of an atom.', 'Gabe Merritt', '@ELODIN Just because you see someone that is mentally disabled, you don&#39;t insult them and call them stupid.

 I think it is pretty easy to deconstruct someone point of view if you first remove all nuance  from their actual position until what you pointing out the absurdity of is a caricature of what they actually say and believe.<br><br>the quote &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; doesn&#39;t meant that he is always objective and the left is always irrational.  It means when faced with an actual piece of information, you cannot discard it because you don&#39;t like what it implies.  If you do that you will never grow.  and if you deny the existence of that piece of information, it does not change the reality of the situation just because you deny it. <br><br>separately, if you have a test and some people do badly on a test, and the test is flawed it doesn&#39;t change that some people did badly on the test.  Do I think that IQ tests are a great measure of intelligence? no.  Do I think that the differences can be caused by how the tests are administered and what kinds of tests the takers have been given previously? yes. Do I think that racial average difference in IQ testing is in any way predictive of how an individual (who we don&#39;t know how they had scored previously or who hasn&#39;t been tested) will perform? no. But none of that means that those averages don&#39;t exist.  The way to show the averages don&#39;t exist is to provide the data of what the actual numbers are.  Even if you can deconstruct why the numbers are that way, or even if there are other factors that correlate better to the differences (which I think is the case) you cannot just deny the data. But also, the existence of the data is not as meaningful as people seem to think it is.<br><br>And to be clear. I have taken the Stanford-Binet IQ test twice, as a young person and in college. I performed quite well both times. I am not white. I am clever, but the types of skills tested, as I remember, are specific kinds of reasoning and you can be intelligent in other ways without mastering those specific types of skills. When I was in middle school, fortunately I was in a class that focused on divergent thinking skills, so I had lots of practice in exactly those kinds of tasks so I had seen them before I ever took the test.  I think there is a limit to what it can test, so if you do well, you likely have those skills (or experience using them) but just because you performed poorly doesn&#39;t make you not intelligent, it just means that you have not mastered the specific skills that are tested.  You may instead, however, have mastered other skills that are not being tested therein. IIRC, you also have to have good enough vocabulary to be able to take a certain level of questions, so you might be limited by that. <br><br>My point: there is always a limitation on what any standard test can measure, so when people try to use it as a proxy for other things, it may be useful over large groups , but fail spectacularly for any individual, or you may be measuring preparation and experience and not intelligence or potential intelligence.

 More like Zoe Based! Some of the points you touched on reminded me of something I wrote the other day when I made points against the very same Shapiro catchphrase. <br><br>I hope someone here enjoys my rambling rough-draft  lol, here goes: <br> Firstly, it juxtaposes facts from feelings, which is a bold assumption. Feelings are experiences, often intense, and always with objective effects within the human brain. Whether or not you experienced a specific feeling at a specific time is a matter of fact. ‚ÄúHow did you feel at that time,‚Äù is a question which you can either answer truthfully or untruthfully, therefore, the presence of a feeling is in itself a fact, without advanced scientific instrumentation, it is a fact we have to take your word for, but it is a fact nonetheless. The feelings of a large fraction of a population are some of the most important facts in politics.  Secondly, it implies facts care about anything at all, which they cannot. Thirdly, it implies that all political policy should be based solely on ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù which is absurd because facts in a vacuum are useless. Facts can INFORM policy. A sufficiently large body of data and empirical evidence, which are the closest things we have to ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù can be used to create scientific theories, or mathematical models which can often predict things like weather or population trends. Policy cannot emerge from facts alone because every policy has an intended effect. Intentions held by policymakers are based on desires, and no matter if it is the desire for power, or pleasure, or worldwide human prosperity, desires are feelings.<br><br>thanks for reading :)

 About the machine learning modelling point: &quot;no one believes that the model is unfair&quot; is not exactly true. In recent years there has been a concerted effort by the entire field to move towards fair modelling, trying to work together across disciplines to try and quantify and codify fairness in a way that models can be trained without having to rely on the assumption of unbiased data. Its a nascent field in the area of AI but of course takes a lot of inspiration from the work done in earlier decades especially in sociology. That goes to show that the scientific community especially around ML has acknowledged the fact that data modelling itself is not inherently more fair than human decision making, if not specifically controlled for. I recommend &quot;Fairness and machine learning&quot; by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, Arvind Narayanan for anyone interested in the topic.

 The problem with &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is that the belief system fosters an understanding that the universe is a detached uncaring place, and in order to survive, people should also be detached and uncaring.<br><br>The thing Shapiro and these &quot;edgy intellectuals&quot; overlook is that humanity has often acted against the cold unfeeling logical facts of the universe and created big lies like life, justice, mercy, duty, community, and order.  As a PTerry Prachett once said, &quot;THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.&quot;<br><br>Facts can only take you so far because they&#39;re a tool that determines what to do next, like finding more facts.

 In her treatise &#39;A Vindication Of The Rights Of Women&#39; (1792) Mary Wollstonecraft noted that the fundamental divisions of society expressed in social relations and through politics, religion,  morality, family life etc, were rooted in the idea that rationality and reason was naturally identified with men, whereas feeling, emotion, and sentiment was identified with women.  <br><br>Wollstonecraft thought it was absurd to say that women couldn&#39;t reason or were lacking in rational capacity, just as it was ridiculous to say that men did not or could not feel, but one of her most striking points was that these social conceptions (that  men were &#39;naturally&#39; rational and women &#39;naturally&#39; emotional) forced men to dress their feelings and passions as though they were only reasonable, and women to dress their reason as though it was just feeling.  <br><br>Wollstonecraft thought that this, as both a description of relations between the sexes and as a principle for the organisation of human society, was a mutually corrupting catastrophe for all concerned, not just because it de-legitimatised women&#39;s reason but, chiefly, because it legitimised men&#39;s emotions, desires, passions and lusts as being essentially reasonable and rational.  <br><br>In her view it was by these means--by men&#39;s appeals to being rational and reasoned creatures--that allowed men to assert their self-declared position as &#39;natural&#39; authorities in all things; the deciders of things; the deciders of what women should be and do, and indeed the deciders of what society should be and do.   By this men were rendered, quite literally, dispassionate - and not in a good way! - while their actual passions were given additional force by dint of being seen as reasoned and reasonable.<br><br><br>Wollstonecraft was spot on imo, and her ideas still resonates today.  When I hear someone declare that &#39;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&#39; I hear a number of things.  I hear a self-authorising claim to natural authority, a superior intellect, and some unique access to higher order, better, more correct information.  I hear a de-legitimisation of people&#39;s intuitions and unarticulated responses to things, and a downgrading of moral or ethical outlooks which challenge certain apparently &#39;factual&#39; interpretations of things.  And I hear someone who, at some level, doesn&#39;t trust their own responses to things and thus seeks to deny a fundamental part of their own humanity.<br><br>We are, without a doubt, thinking beings who feel and feeling beings who think.  We have evolved this way, and we operate this way in the world.  To seek to subvert, or even to excise completely, one or other of these aspects of our being is to diminish our own humanity in a calamitous act of self-mutilation.  <br><br>Thanks for a great vid btw.

 You know what&#39;s funny? &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; really wasn&#39;t even first made famous by Ben Shapiro. I could be wrong, here, because it&#39;s been years, but I first heard said by, I think, Richard Dawkins, probably all the way back in 2008-ish or so when I was reading the Bible <b>and</b> his book The God Delusion. I wasn&#39;t <b>quite</b> an atheist, yet, but I was pretty much there.<br><br>I started using it, as well, in debates with Young Earth Creationists. I would say it in defense of evolution. In fact, to this day, the way I sort of define my understanding of &quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;belief&quot;, and &quot;agnostic atheism&quot; (which is how I identify in terms of faith in higher powers and such) is to say that I don&#39;t &quot;believe in&quot; evolution. I don&#39;t have to, because it&#39;s a fact. It&#39;s happening regardless of my belief in it. Allowing for the fuzziness of all that we don&#39;t know, when it comes to the origin of the modern diversity of species (how we, humans, got here), we <b>know</b> ... it was evolution (via natural selection, genetic drift, sexual selection, random mutation, etc). And when it comes to questions about the nature of reality (i.e. those questions that are best answered, at least in theory, via the scientific method), &quot;I don&#39;t want to believe. I want to know&quot;.<br><br>And granted, that&#39;s playing a bit loose with the definitions of both &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;belief&quot;. Most people, I think, don&#39;t separate them like that. And honestly, I do understand why. It&#39;s just... separating them like that is how I (subjectively) understand both concepts... and how I inform myself on how the world works. In fact, I&#39;d argue that the reason people like Ben Shapiro and such like to parrot &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is specifically because, for them, the venn diagram of &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;belief&quot; is just one circle. Now I&#39;m not arguing that there&#39;s no overlap between the two (of course there is... facts <b>do</b> care about our feelings, as you say), but it&#39;s not just one circle, either.<br><br>And to further prove that I&#39;m not fully correct to separate knowledge and belief in that way... my entire worldview is actually informed by science and such. My agnostic atheism, my Socialism(/burgeoning Anarcho-Communism), my support of civil rights movements, my mistrust of the police, my intersectional feminism... all of that is informed by my understanding of scientific and statistical concepts. For example... I <b>know</b> Shapiro is wrong to insist that gender is a binary because of the biological and genetic science that utterly proves him wrong.<br><br>There are billions of genders, and every time conservatives, transphobes, etc complain about that, we add billions more... :D

 The privilege of going to uni, at least if you pay attention while there, is learning and practising the tenet that you can never be truly objective when addressing anything that isn&#39;t related to something like vectors. 70% of such papers are spent justifying your every sentence constituting anything, from hypothesis to background to methods to theories based off of several other sources. That&#39;s just to be able to possibly say anything about anything, even though its based entirely off of you making personal choices, and the concluding chapter is always the same: more testing and analysis is needed. I get why people are frustrated by this or have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, because this inherently makes it difficult to know how to approach others in life when you can&#39;t make the instinctual human gathering of info through quick inferences. Either way, it is rather disingenuous and laughable to whittle down a human being within a sociohistorical-political context down to an algorithm, as if quasalities aren&#39;t a thing as well.

 ‚ÄúWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.‚Äù ‚Äî Joan Didion<br><br>The last time I did acid all I could think about towards the end was how language influences our reality. We communicate in order to share information about our perceived realities ‚Äî and that‚Äôs true whether we‚Äôre talking about our physical reality, or our emotional, mental, internal reality. By uttering a sentence to someone, we create an idea that we share, which influences the way we act in the future. That my last relationship failed because of the things he and I said to each other ‚Äî whether or not our perceptions of the relationship were objectively factual, the way we communicated about them had a very real impact on our lives, because what we said communicated meaning about our internal realities, and therefore altered the nature of how we saw one another, felt about our relationship ‚Äî what we said and the stories we told each other created a narrative as impactful as facts, it altered our shared reality, and ultimately decided the future of our relationship.<br><br>Frege in On Sense and Reference talks about (this is a serious paraphrase here) how there is a physical reality of our world, language which we use to describe it, and our own internal perception of reality. He also states that we can‚Äôt share our perceptions because we can‚Äôt swap eyes or ears. Which, literally, sure. But I also don‚Äôt believe we use language only to describe the physical: we use it to describe the internal, as well. That‚Äôs why we have art, theatre, poetry. To try to share our vivid internal lives, because subjective emotion requires precisely honed, intentional, subjective communication. And while we can‚Äôt physically and scientifically measure our feelings the way we can measure our physical reality, our internal world plays a very real role in effecting how we behave, and therefore our futures.<br><br>Whatever, yada yada yada. Check out the Frege thing, there‚Äôs a beautiful example about retinal moons I love that‚Äôs stuck with me ever since. I disagree with his conclusions but think the way he comes to them is really interesting.

 I liked this video, and I think all your points were very well made. Your point about what it means to be objective are also reflected in the scientific method. When you are doing a study, you have to state what elements you can‚Äôt control, and then when you analyse the results you have to refer back to those elements and how they could be skewing things. I think the points are good and valid regardless of that, but it‚Äôs interesting that even the methods we use to obtain the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù acknowledge that they are subject to uncertainty

 Yup, you got it right. But even then there still are facts that don&#39;t care about your feelings such has climate change is caused by humans. We have overwhelming evidence for that and when you add it up it would require an extremly biased mind to interpret it otherwise. And an example where facts do care about feelings is something like men earn more than women, that&#39;s a fact but some peeps automatically assume that you know this is unfair without thinking of the possibility that maybe men choose more risky, higher paiyng jobs than women and that&#39;s why.

There are thousands of possible, well-informed and analytical, guests he could have on who have decades of experience with criminal justice reform.<br><br>I hate using the term ‚ÄòDunning-Kruger‚Äô, because I know Sam is smart, but on this topic it fits his approach very well, in that the confidence he displays regarding the correctness of his own position is commensurate with his ignorance of the history and details of the subject.

 I feel like my intellectual journey (if I can call it that) has been fraught with hubris at times, though I&#39;ve come gradually to appreciate the importance of humility. I used to think I had it all figured out, then I read some books. What I learned from the books taught me that I clearly knew much less than I had foolishly believed I knew, but having now done the reading, I was up to speed and had it all figured out this time. I was then confronted with different views I hadn&#39;t considered, and different books I hadn&#39;t read, and experiences and perspectives from lives I hadn&#39;t lived. This led me to be highly sceptical, probably to an unhealthy degree. To this day I still feel intellectually paralysed and times; unable to get over the nagging thought: you don&#39;t really know enough to come to that conclusion, do you?<br><br>I was kinda troubled when I reflected on things and found that a lot of my beliefs are based on second-hand knowledge from people whose credentials I haven&#39;t really subjected to much scrutiny. I&#39;m a bit of a sucker, really, accepting many arguments uncritically if they manage to clear the flimsy hurdles my fairly uneducated mind puts in front of them. I remember reading a book by Erich Fromm and being like &quot;yeah, this sounds about right&quot;, and then one day coming across some criticisms of the book and thinking &quot;shit, maybe it wasn&#39;t right. I&#39;m not sure what to think&quot; and just trying to push it out of my mind. A lot of the time I come up against ideas that I don&#39;t know how to analyse. I&#39;m quite into the Brazilian fella Paulo Freire. He&#39;s contributed a lot to educational theory (which might be something that interests you, Zoe). He has a lot of ideas that appeal to my political sensibilities, but I really don&#39;t know how to work out if what he&#39;s saying is &#39;factual&#39; or whether it is just how things &#39;seem&#39; from where he&#39;s standing. I find a lot of ideas difficult to critique. Like Marx&#39;s theory of alienation: I &quot;feel&quot; that there&#39;s something true about it, but I&#39;m not sure how to confirm it. <br><br>When it comes to scientific studies and data-driven stuff, I&#39;m even more helpless. I sometimes feel like I&#39;m just a bundles of values that I&#39;ve sort of taken on over the course of my life, and I try to justify these values by attaching myself to &#39;credible&#39; studies and writers (what makes them credible? No idea) that back up what I feel to be the case. I have changed my mind on things over the years, and I went vegan because of the power of the arguments for doing so. So I&#39;m not totally dogmatic and stuck in my ways. But I&#39;m not sure I have a very good way of sifting through the information out there and forming opinions that are grounded in the optimal use of reason. <br><br>The shocking thing is, I have a degree in Philosophy, so you&#39;d think I&#39;d be pretty apt at analysing arguments and working out the stuff I&#39;ve mentioned already. Nope. I can&#39;t be arsed most of the time. There&#39;s just too much I want to know and it sometimes overwhelms me. You could spend years studying Marx, for example, and still be uncertain about some of the interpretative issues and debates. I tend to read something and then move on to something else that may be only loosely related. I try to think about it and tend to get nowhere. I feel like the Dude from the Big Lebowski sometimes: there&#39;s a lot of strands to keep in old Duder&#39;s head, man! <br><br>Anyway...yeah, I no longer believe I have it figured out. I wouldn&#39;t even call my attitude towards knowledge humble. Bewildered is probably a better word.

 To be fair to Ben, for something like IQ disparities by ethnicity, there is a noticeable difference between races (this is largely undisputed due to the amount of studies).

I just finished watching this video as I was playing around with some graphs on Excel for my Master&#39;s and just thought about how me having been wrong about him and people like him has made it easy for me to challenge myself and others when it comes to politics, social issues etc. Since studying in University, it has really made it clear to me how much work it takes to become an expert or specialist in your field, that I really have just stopped listening to or am very vary of people who spout opinions about fields they have no expertise in - be that politicians, online personalities, grifters etc. You don&#39;t have to have a diploma in a field to be knowledgeable (University is not the Holy Grail of knowledge) or that those who do have a diploma are always right, but now I take more time before I jump to agree or disagree with someone.

 When a predictive model that attempts to estimate the behavior of a stochastic system is deployed, it isn‚Äôt just biased data that can skew the results. Models of stochastic systems (which include most sociological, economic and political models) can also have bias in their internal design. A model needs to be configured or ‚Äútuned‚Äù if you will, and this process of configuring or calibrating is itself sensitive to bias. For example, a predictive model can be tuned to be risk averse, risk seeking or risk neutral. Even something simpler such as a model that filters out ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù data can have bias cooked in to it. It may be configured to filter out events based on the frequency of their occurrence but there will be bias involved in deciding which frequencies to reject. Even configuring it to be ‚Äúall pass‚Äù also indicates a certain bias.<br><br>Based on their sensitivity to bias in their input and configuration, a lot of such models become ‚Äúcontrollable‚Äù to the extent that they can give you the results you desire.

 There are some big problems with your source material for this video. Originally, I typed a criticism of your video that was pretty mean, but then, I decided it was better to just give you better sources. I think what you&#39;re really trying to talk about here is Philosophy of Science. Most of your sources cited for this video are political pundits, commentators, etc., who are not reliable. You also cite Stephen Jay Gould, who has been discredited no end. He has a logical fallacy named after him: The Goulding Two-Step. <br><br>Now, because you say you&#39;re an English Lit professor, I can understand why those mistakes would have been made. And so with those criticisms out of the way, I&#39;d like to recommend some better source material to help you flesh out your arguments better:<br><br>The structure of scientific discovery, Stephen Kuhn. (Argues the point about scientific discoveries existing within a paradigm).<br>The logic of scientific discovery, Karl Popper. (Argues the point that science is a way of thinking that deals exclusively with falsification, scientific truths are always provisional, meaning they have a limited form of objectivity that is nuanced as opposed to absolute objectivity. The former is true science, the latter is religious argumentation, masquerading as science).<br>The Meaning of Meanings, Hilary Putnam. (Essay about meanings within language and how they work, which seems like something you&#39;re already interested in).<br>Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man, Wilfrid Sellars. (Essay in &#39;Science, Perception and Reality&#39;).<br><br>I hope that helps you in future videos.

 Interesting thing about blurred houses in Google maps:<br>When it&#39;s a house that is blurred, but the area around is relatively clear then it&#39;s a privacy thing. In some countries you can request Google blur your house for privacy reasons.<br>For some reason this is much more common in Germany, hence the nickname Blurmany in some geoguesser communities.

 Ok granted the disclaimer at the beginning about you not being a philosopher, here is a rephrasing of the message you proffered at the beginning from a philosophical viewpoint: &quot;The statement &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.&quot; is truth-apt and false irrespective of whether one adopts a stance of epistemic antirealism OR epistemic realism, since the latter necessarily admits for the existence of such things as facts-about-feelings and facts-derivable-from-feelings (cognitivism).&quot;<br><br>Two more tangents:<br>1. On the reliability of science: One can be a scientific antirealist without being an epistemic antirealist, people like Shapiro conflate necessary convergence because they have a superficial understanding of philosophy.<br>2. On the over-reliance on rationality: Rationality is the art of winning. Rationalist/Rationalist-absolutist is not an euphemism for feelings-indifferent. Even a pure rationalist would never claim &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.&quot;. The statement is, frankly, *ir*rational. For context: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational</a>

 So still facts do not care about your feelings and you should change your perception to match it as much as possible? <br><br>For example maps do not give perfect representation of the world, it is actually proven that you cannot map 3D bended surface perfectly on 2D. Just because for a lot of people it is good enough does not mean that it is perfect, fact do not care about feelings and there is no way that where changing ones feeling would change the fact that it is impossible.

 It feels like you&#39;ve made a video addressing issues you have with a third-hand experience of Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris (who btw, isn&#39;t even applicable for most of scenarios that you mentioned) you got from other people. <br><br>For example:<br>1. Jordan Peterson doesn&#39;t argue that climate change isn&#39;t real, his arguement is a humanitarian one where focussing on improving living standards in 3rd world countries automatically improves emissions standards with living ones. He also has no issue addressing people with their preferred pronouns, but rather against adding said preferrence into the constitution. In countries like China,  Indonesia, you can be imprisoned for using unpreferred/unconstitutional language against the establishment.<br>JP on climate change: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/jeremy.earth/2019/07/08/climate-change-isnt-a-priority/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/jeremy.earth/2019/07/08/climate-change-isnt-a-priority/amp/</a><br>JPs views on trans people summed up pretty well here: <a href="https://thepangean.com/Jordan-Peterson-Phenomenon">https://thepangean.com/Jordan-Peterson-Phenomenon</a><br><br>2. Sam Harris&#39; main argument is against religion, radical islam and people&#39;s vehement internalisation of pop-islam as it&#39;s true image rather than seeing how it actually affects it&#39;s subjects across the world. He also says the Christianity runs the same risks if we don&#39;t accept the shortcomings of it. And it&#39;s entirely true. People pretend that Islam is profeminist, while in radical Islamist countries, they spay women like cattle: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/lifestyle/people/story/female-genital-mutilation-india-clitoris-pleasure-muslim-bohra-community-1162510-2018-02-06">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/lifestyle/people/story/female-genital-mutilation-india-clitoris-pleasure-muslim-bohra-community-1162510-2018-02-06</a><br>And the UN writes puff piece articles sandbagging the issue: <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/publications/delinking-female-genital-mutilationcutting-islam">https://www.unfpa.org/publications/delinking-female-genital-mutilationcutting-islam</a><br><br>3. Coming to Ben Shapiro, there are things that he doesn&#39;t which I disagree with (like the click-baitey titles, debating with the object to only win, his constant insistence on using biological argument for dealing with LGBTQ issues, etc). But even with all that most of what you said doesn&#39;t really apply for him as well. No one is saying that climate change isn&#39;t a real issue (except Alex Jones, maybe) but rather how most climate change advocates misconstrue information. Eg: China has the highest emissions because all factory/manufacturer has been outsourced to them by 1st world countries, US still has a higher per capita co2 emissions (more than twice of China). So, a solution that doesn&#39;t take those differences into account isn&#39;t fair, cutting down emissions would be catastrophic for the populations of growing nations. It&#39;s the weird alarmist, apocalyptic cult we have around climate change, most predictive models they have used have been incorrect, time and time again. That&#39;s the primary issue. Pretending that green energy is the answer, as if that doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own shortcomings or it&#39;s impractical to assume that its applicable in countries where people can barely make a living. Those are the issues.<br><br>The difference I think is, that feeling are easier to manipulate by people looking to benefit out of the division, feelings are a gray area (and it&#39;s taboo these days to question someone&#39;s feelings) while inconsistencies in facts are easier to spot and rebut (don&#39;t get me wrong, facts can be misrepresented but again, it&#39;s easier to spot) Feelings are very individual, hence the world stands to harm overall if we took them into account while making decisions, bad people have strong feelings as well. Feelings also have a hierarchy, ones at the top get to voice their opinions while others are expected to shut up, it&#39;s regressive. History has been all about one groups feelings superseding another.

 A note on stories and models: mathematical and scientific models are, in essence, stories. This is as true in sociology as it is in specialized mathematics. These stories can reflect reality, or they might not, and they are even open to interpretation. As long as we can ask the question &#39;why?&#39;, informing practical decisions with scientific information requires that we select some model from among a multiplicity of those consistent with physical observations. For example, suppose one has a well tested and predictive mathematical model of motor vehicle accident distribution in a city that shows high rates of motor vehicle accidents, adjusted for population density, in high-density residential neighbourhoods. One might conclude that apartment-dwellers are bad drivers by nature, and therefore that no one should be allowed to live in apartments. The model tells a story that is true to life, but the meaning (in particular the causal relation) which we choose to ascribe to it relies upon further information, and the decisions that we choose to let it inform must necessarily have emotional and societal contributions.

I went from the typical &quot;Black people should just stop being criminals&quot; mindset to the &quot;nobody is letting them&quot; realization.

 As someone who does have philosophical training, and is concerned with matters of epistemology and metaethics more than most, I intensely dislike Ben Shapiro, because his argument style does not advance discussion or learning.  Shapiro is a master of the snuck premise, where he frames the question such that it implicitly presupposes his preferred conclusion.  If his opponents accept this framing, he wins by default because they&#39;ve just affirmed his conclusion.<br><br>I further dispute that Ben Shapiro as his ilk do value rationality.  They value logic in that they use it, but they don&#39;t use it in an intellectually honest way.  Logic is the thing that helps Shapiro win arguments after he sneaks his conclusion into the premise.<br><br>But he cannot actually construct an argument in favour of his opinions, because his opinions are normative.  Shapiro is arguing for what ought be, and that simply cannot be done logically without including a normative claim within his assumptions.  Remove that assumption, and the argument is guaranteed to fail.  This is the is-ought problem, and no one has yet been able to defeat it.<br><br>Some schools of thought explicitly reject is-ought, insisting that it does not hold (modern Objectivism, for example), but none have actually constructed a coherent system of reasoning which permits the drawing of normative conclusions from non-normative premises.<br><br>It is worth nothing that this problem exists for all value-based arguments.  Much as Shapiro and Peterson cannot reasonably justify their conclusions, nor can those postmodern neo-Marxists you mentioned.<br><br>The way Shapiro uses, &quot;Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; is absurd, because he&#39;s exploiting people&#39;s inability to distinguish between material conditionals and indicative conditionals and biconditionals.  The only way facts care about our feelings is if we misdefine &quot;facts,&quot; which is something most people do.  Facts are not opinions we can defend.  Facts are things which are true irrespective of our knowledge of them.  Shapiro uses this phrase as a weapon to undermine real evidence in favour of positions which evoke strong emotions.  That&#39;s a misuse of the concept.  That BLM makes people angry is not reason to believe in BLM, but nor is it a reason to oppose BLM.  It simply isn&#39;t relevant, but that&#39;s not how Shapiro uses it.<br><br>It is the case that much of the data we have on these topics is biased.  Shapiro argues we should ignore the bias, or deny the bias.  But his opponents argue that the bias is evidence that the contrary conclusion is true.  Neither is the case.  The biased data is simply not useful on its own.<br><br>I further dispute it is impossible to draw conclusions irrespective of our feelings.  This is the whole point of formal logic.  This is why arguments need to be assessed based on the quality of logic they use, not their conclusions.  Any argument you find compelling must be equally compelling as any other logically equivalent argument.  If that&#39;s not the case, you&#39;re likely being biased by your opinions of the conclusion or the messenger or the provenance of the message or the context in which you heard it, none of which are relevant.

 We humans are often terrible judges of things happening right in front of us. I read once that parents of babies underreported how often their baby boys cried because they had a preconceived idea that boys cry less often than girls. Thw babies were recorded, and the boys and girls cried the same amount (because of course they did) but the parents perceived that the boys cried less. Your perception of reality is always flawed.

 Side note: it sucks to know that I watched this game of telephone play out in real time, tried to stop it, but couldn‚Äôt.<br><br>In online communities, atheists carved out their own niche ~2010 critiquing the right‚Äôs repeated attempts at theocracy. They argued that it was heinous to turn one‚Äôs faith into the law of the land, effectively making it mandatory for us to convert to another person‚Äôs religion, in deeds alone if not in belief. They argued that unquestioning creationism might be emotionally comforting to certain people, but these people don‚Äôt have the factual basis to hijack public policy. ‚ÄòFacts don‚Äôt care about their feelings.‚Äô<br><br>The trained lawyers, philosophers, and other argumenticians on the right turned around and went, ‚Äòhold on, I can PROVE God!‚Äô and did their typical door-to-door salesman arguments like ‚Äòwho CREATED those laws of physics, <i>hmmm?</i> :3c‚Äô and, seeing themselves as the true rationalists and clear victors, echoed, ‚ÄòMaybe the facts don‚Äôt care about <i>your</i> feelings. Checkmate, atheists.‚Äô<br><br>Around the same time, some tiny friggin YouTuber made a video series about the casual, genre-stagnating forms of sexism seen in some turn-of-millennium video games. The atheist community, who apparently plays a lot of video games, got flashbacks to Jack ‚Äòban the Murder Simulators‚Äô Thompson even though the structures of these arguments were <i>entirely different</i> and swore vengeance on Feminism itself. They took the framework from their arguments against religious folks ‚Äî ‚Äòyou haven‚Äôt proven to me that this exists. I do not physically see it before me‚Äô ‚Äî and applied it to the social sciences underpinning feminist theory. If we cannot produce a photograph of the Patriarchy&#39;s political office, then asking people to believe in it is tantamount to asking people to believe in Lucifer, by their reasoning. If they just spend long enough sealioning and DARVO-ing, they can disprove any social cause that questions their precious vidya.<br><br>This pushed the larger atheist community further right, into an unsteady alliance with their fundamentalist nemeses, against all manner of social progress. The atheist community failed to recognize the cultural Christianity inherent in the status quo they were fighting to uphold. Where once they championed the freedom of ‚Äòalternative lifestyles,‚Äô now they decry ‚Äòdegeneracy‚Äô and ‚Äòidentity politics.‚Äô Where once they criticized Western civilization‚Äôs foundational sexism, now they pretend it vanished without a trace in the 70s...but they still blame women who report getting assaulted.<br><br>Because of this alliance, they shifted their hatred of religion toward Islam, citing the US- and UK-funded insurgents as proof of the inherent wickedness of the entire Middle East. They stopped focusing on social problems at home because they had to spend all their time hyping a foreign boogie man that they could use to threaten their domestic political opponents. When caravans of refugees fled US-funded drug cartels in the south, they became the scapegoat for decades of economic recession, because the whataboutist alliance refused to criticize America on our own merits. It had to be a perfect system, sabotaged by outsiders, rather than the inevitable outcome of generations-stagnant wages and the false promise of a trickle-down economy. This revitalized a particular sect of racial extremists who opposed any form of immigration since the 1920s.<br><br>I spent the last decade arguing against the bad faith garbage on all these fronts, only to watch them roll together into a katamari of reactionary nonsense, and all I got was this chronic migraine.

 My Gender and Law prof said exactly the same thing. When judges make decisions, they&#39;re expected to be rational and objective. But they&#39;re still falling back on personal biases and realities to make decisions - falling back on feelings. It&#39;s theorised that judges know what outcome they want - they just use the law as a means of getting there. And it&#39;s a problem when judges, especially in the UK, hail from upper class and exclusive backgrounds, and use their subjective reality which is imposed on all as the objective truth. The solution, at least for judges, is to consider as many perspectives as possible (rather than defaulting to &#39;facts&#39;), and adopt the most equitable one.

 May I make an observation?  You spend way too much time on qualifiers.  Ben Shapiro is a racist, a sexist, and a denier of logic.  His whole thing is to tell insane people they&#39;re insanity (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc) is okay.  You don&#39;t have to qualify that.  You don&#39;t have to put a disclaimer before a sentence.   You&#39;re criticizing a monster.  His followers are monsters.  Nothing you can say will change that, so stop trying to.  I know why you do it, but that&#39;s not going to stop his troll army of hate mongers from not liking any criticism of his BS.  Think about stopping that.

Shapiro&#39;s ledger of Valid Facts all derives from institutions he deems valid, specifically, institutions in power at a time when the economic class, race, and gender of his favor were unquestioned.<br><br>&quot;Facts Don&#39;t Care About Your Feelings&quot; is to performative rationalists what the Divine Right of Kings was to European monarchs, what the Mandate of Heaven was to Chinese emperors; it&#39;s a post-hoc justification for an unshakable, immutable socio-political hierarchy, for whom the Lessers do not, Can Not, have &quot;facts&quot;. New data on gender and sexuality? Feelings. Pointing out various holes in research pleading, effectively, for a return to Slavery-era phrenological theory?

It&#39;s a wink and a nod that the non-white, the woman, the queer, and the politically subversive are subhumans; a polite, table manners presentation around the unspoken sentiment that we need to be broken back into our Natural Place *at best*, when it isn&#39;t a smug appeal to wiping us off the planet altogether.<br><br>They seek not to persuade by sound argument, but to intimidate and disconcert, to paraphrase Sartre, (ironic given the original context of the line, but accurate nonetheless.)

 Sorry, you aren&#39;t cynical enough to realistically approach Ben Shapiro&#39;s work. It doesn&#39;t occur to you that someone intelligent and educated is simply lying through their teeth because that&#39;s what is what brings them money and influence. The ironic thing is (and I say this as someone who grew up on Rush Limbaugh in a rural rightwing family) the entire rightwing movement that Ben is a cheerleader for is based on <i>ignoring</i> facts, even as they claim that facts are all that matters. Those supposed &quot;facts&quot; that they trumpet are made up by billionaire-funded thinktanks. Those supposed facts are then disseminated through an alternative media ecosystem that the radical rightwing billionaires Ben and his ilk serve built from scratch in the 90s to attack the Clinton administration when they began to fear that the propaganda state which Ronald Reagan and his buddies in Hollywood had established during the 80s was crumbling. <br><br>I was too naive to understand the significance for 20 years as I blithely voted a GOP ticket in election after election, but I clearly remember a Rush Limbaugh show in 1995, during the debate on welfare &quot;reform&quot; which illustrates the deliberateness of the right&#39;s embrace of this philosophy about facts. Rush said &quot;this liberal says they worked hard for their welfare.&quot; Then Rush played a video clip of an activist saying &quot;we fought hard for welfare.&quot; which is a subtly, but very different statement. Apparently just to be sure nobody thought he had simply made a mistake, Rush said &quot;see, &#39;we worked hard for our welfare&#39;&quot; and then he played the clip again. He repeated this process half a dozen times. I was puzzled, and stopped listening and watching Rush, but it wasn&#39;t until I stopped actively defending the GOP and the rightwing movement in 2015 that I began to understand the significance of what I&#39;d seen. <br><br>Rush wasn&#39;t making a mistake, he was encouraging his followers to reject literal facts in favor of believing whatever made them disgusted, angry, and fearful enough to go to the polls. It is important to note that whenever you actually shoot down a rightwinger with true facts instead of the propaganda soup their leaders feed to them, they always fall back on &quot;everyone is entitled to their opinion.&quot; Because that is the true basis of the rightwing movement. The lies they believe are just a smokescreen. It is easy for them to latch onto those lies, but the truth is that all they really care about is their opinions, and they have thoroughly insulated those opinions from facts through the ideology that they are entitled to those opinions in spite of the facts. By treating those lies as &quot;facts&quot; in all seriousness, you are yourself falling for those lies.<br><br>Reasonable people are supremely ill-equipped to deal with someone like Ben Shapiro. They assume that their rightwing opponents must fundamentally be operating from a position of good faith, but that is simply false. They are simply lying. It is purely a cynical calculation for the sake of power, just like a serial killer playing nice to entice their next victim into their car. In Ben Shapiro&#39;s case, it is because the billionaires he serves own vast fortunes in oil claims that would become valueless if the price of oil dropped below the cost of extracting that oil. To prevent change, they need to trick enough of the American people into believing a propaganda smokescreen that it paralyzes the government. So they see spending millions funding Ben Shapiro and others spreading rightwing propaganda to prevent change as simply a good investment. While there are billionaires who hold liberal views, their fortunes are not directly at stake the way the rightwing billionaires&#39; fortunes are, so they are not motivated to pump those millions into propaganda. Only the people of the world waking up and understanding the magnitude of the lies they have been fed can stop what is happening.

Whether You call something a sin (religious perspective) or misconduct (secular perspective) many such acts overlap as they are driven from social norms. What is more, if we scratch deeper than basics we will find that, for example, any human right has some dogmats at its core which can&#39;t be based in science, hell even in hard sciences You have some dogmats (primal concepts in geometry for example, these can be somewhat resolved with metalanguage theory - which in itself is inductive and can lead to infinte loop).

 This is an absolutely stellar video. I&#39;m in education, and there has been a major push to center data-driven practice in schools. It&#39;s been something that&#39;s had me very wary, as I haven&#39;t seen as much focus on the limits of data in a school setting, nor much guidance on structuring what kind of data we collect. There&#39;s also an inherent bias to what forms are readily available: disciplinary numbers are extremely easy to pull, whereas long-term adjustment and success and development are much... squishier.

 I have a masters in computer science and completely agree. Facts might be objectively true or false, but what facts we care about and how we respond to them is an inherently subjective question. Additionally, it&#39;s negligent to ignore the impact that our culture has on the frameworks we build for analyzing reality. Trying to hide under the cloak of objectivity paradoxically seems to make one even more biased.

I&#39;m nobody to say this, but the teachers I remember, and probably will remember the most, are the ones who really took the time to talk about things like this. <br>I&#39;m in the last year of &quot;secondary school&quot; (the equivalent to the last year at HS, if I&#39;m not mistaken), and I just felt that I had two teachers who really changed my vision in the world. Both of them are linguistics or literature teachers. I guess there&#39;s something special in those subjects.<br>I must say I was, for a lot of time, this kind of person who thinks he has the &quot;true&quot;. It was 4 years ago or something, but at least now I know it&#39;s really hard to be objective (if not impossible). That was thanks to those teachers. They made a difference in my world&#39;s vision.

 &quot;Our AI overlords&quot; are actually pretty good examples of how bias in data sets leads to nonsensical solutions to problems. Data needs to be refined for it&#39;s purpose and must be interpreted in a way that&#39;s fitting for the type of conclusions that are to be derived from it, or things go wrong. The upside is that instead of arguing with neural networks you just change a few lines of code. Or feed them better data to remove biases. Okay, the latter works with humans as well.

 Hello Zoe, hope you actually read this or at least jump to the PS.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh boy, where do I begin? I don&#39;t even like Ben but that is pretty much the only phrase I agree with so I <b>feel</b> compelled to type something: <br><br><br><br>&gt;Facts do not, in fact, care a bout your feelings. Facts being separate from feelings is the fundamental assumption of science: that there is an external world that is independent from us. We don&#39;t even need to get too scientific about it. Example: you are very thirsty but there is no water around you. Feels really bad but feeling bad doesn&#39;t just make water appear. Why not use a more social relevant fact example? Because I don&#39;t want to get blacklisted, no way I am getting deeper than this least I end up being associated with these &quot;intellectual&quot; quacks.<br><br><br><br>&gt;The subtext is really strong supporting the ambiguity of data. There is an important difference. Models made by people to interpret things that are relevant to people are subject to discussion. The actual computation (fact) that results from the model, that follows strict logic. Remember, computers are fast idiots. They can do whatever we ask them to, deciding whether that something is appropriate falls onto us. All the while external reality (facts) remains unchanged. It doesn&#39;t matter that people hide behind actual facts to avoid accountability, that is still a people problem, not a reality problem.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One thing I would agree with you is that the people on the &quot;Intellectual dark web&quot; are not using facts, especially not Mr. Ben I use facts only when convenient Shapiro. That is not to say, however, that they are entirely wrong or that just by agreeing with them in some points can be dismissed out of hand by association. This latter dismissal and getting associated with them is why people shouldn&#39;t use their real identities online. Facts, are facts regardless of who says them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>PS.<br>Funny that you bring up the &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; which is one of the biggest clown fiestas that science has ever seen. All of it because a very (racist) and a very (anti-racist) scientist really wanted the facts to be on their side and so they proceeded to bend data to their will. Just check out the Wikipedia section &quot;Reassessing Morton&#39;s skull measurements&quot;<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man</a><br><br><br><br><br><br>Out of all the topics on the &quot;dark intellectual web&quot;, the racial topic is the most baffling. It really is like each side is very invested into their respective sides. They also bring up different sets of facts. &quot;Shaun&quot; and &quot;The Alternative Hypothesis&quot; are perfect examples of an old feud and funny that you only brought up one. I haven&#39;t watched either of them in a long while but it looks like the latter one wiped out his channel. Looks like some fragments are still out there on Bitchute spread on other accounts. Not sure why he took it down but that is another contemporary (maybe not so much now) example of a clown fiesta back and forth regarding this issue.<br><br><br><br><br><br>PS#2<br>I really like the idiom &quot;clown fiesta&quot; and this is the perfect opportunity to use it.<br>Also, nice cats.

 We talk about feelings because &quot;feelings don&#39;t care about facts.&quot;<br><br>This is everything Dan Olson is talking about in &quot;In Search of a Flat Earth&quot; from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ISzmBBTvo&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a> to the end:<br><br>&gt;The Q-Anon map of global politics is almost pure nonsense, but the shape of it isn&#39;t.  If you were to map out the political landscape of the world it would look a lot like this `(gestures to image on screen)`: thousands of political entities -- big and small, all with their own goals, values, and incentives -- navigating an equally complex series of conflicts, alliances and rivalries, in competition for power, fame, and limited resources.  So how is something like this making the world simpler?<br><br>&gt;Because it takes all this -- the chaos -- of millions of individuals trying to reshape the world in their own way, for good or ill, and turns it into a single entity.  All the world&#39;s complexity, all the chaos, it&#39;s all the fault of one group.  Not an ideology, not a worldview, not historical inertia, not anything so nebulous as the way we think about the world.  A single, tangible, identifiable group with a written agenda.<br><br>&gt;These types of conspiratorial beliefs, for all their complex cosmologies, exist in opposition to structural challenges.  And a lot of people get involved because they resent structural criticism.<br><br>&gt;Structural criticism poses that we are the way we are because because of complicated forces -- some intentional, and many not -- that have compounded and morphed over generations.  There&#39;s no plan, no template, and no goal.  The world won&#39;t magically morph into a better place as a function of its very existence.  <i>We</i> are responsible for confronting the past, fixing the present, and shaping the future.<br><br>&gt;Q-anon -- and not just q-anon... many, people, many, many people -- want to believe that things are the way they are because someone has deliberately crafted it to be that way... that there is a natural order to the world, and that we need to just trust the plan.<br><br>&gt;{&quot;sjw&quot; topics}  -- all of these are interlocking, systemic issues.  These are inarguably disruptions to the status quo, confrontations of deep-rooted complexities that intersect the lives and futures of billions of people.  And it&#39;s that disruption -- not the underlying injustices, not the underlying conflicts -- that make q-anon anxious, that make q-anon feel like the world has gotten too complex.  They don&#39;t want those complexities to exist, and by talking about them, you <i>make</i> them exist.<br><br>&gt;It&#39;s a form of magical thought.  Talking about police brutality wills police brutality into existence.  A disruption of the status quo is seen as a disruption of the natural order.  The problem they see is that no-one has made those people `({in this list})` shut up.  That is what they want: someone to come in and make those people shut up, to go away, to put things back where they belong.  <br><br>&gt;*<b>Now, this is not a philosophy unique to q-anon.  It&#39;s the life-blood of all reactionary movements.*</b> And they are of course in conflict with facts. Global warming, to pull one example, is _real_, and an existential threat to civilization. That&#39;s just a fact. It wasn&#39;t willed into existence by people talking about it. It isn&#39;t over-tuned leftists looking for patterns in clouds. It&#39;s the byproduct of dumping CO2 into the atmoshhpere on an industrial scale for 200yrs.  And there&#39;s a temptation to engage on that level, to confront all the material ways in which they&#39;re just wrong and it largely does not work.  And what&#39;s unique about Q-Anon is the degree to which it doesn&#39;t work.  The degree to which the movement is immune to evidence. All reactionary movements are in tension with reality. A tension that eventually results in a psychological crisis, and believe systems like Q-Anon are the end-point of that crisis. The point where reality itself becomes an enemy. Because ultimately it&#39;s not about facts. It&#39;s about power. Q-anons are not otherwise empty vessels who believe one wacky thing. They have an agenda. Q-anon -- what it accepts, what it believes -- is driven by the outcomes it justifies.<br><br>&gt;The reason they aren&#39;t more bothered by Q constantly getting things wrong, why they aren&#39;t more bothered by the extreme inconsistencies and outright contradictions by the claims that are just materially wrong, is because <b>*it gives them power over others who are bound to something as weak and flimsy as reality.*</b>  They claim to be against corruption while hanging their hopes on an openly corrupt man, and that naked hypocrisy is the point.  They will effortly carve out an exception because it makes them exceptional. They engage in wild hypocrisy as an act of domination.  Adhering to something demonstrably untrue out of spite, because <b>*they believe that power belongs to those with the greatest will to take it.  And what greater sign of will than the ability to overwrite Truth?  Their will is a hammer that they&#39;re using to beat reality itself into a shape of their choosing.*</b> A simple world, where reality is exactly what it looks like through their eyes -- devoid of complexity, devoid of change, where they&#39;re right and their enemies are silent.  They&#39;re trying to build a flat earth.<br><br>Sound familiar? Remember what Sartre said of the anti-semites in Germany:<br><br>&gt;‚ÄúNever believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, <b>*for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play.*</b> They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.‚Äù<br><br>There&#39;s also Philosophy Tube&#39;s essay Antisemitism: An Analysis, 48m in.  A nearly identical thesis.

 <b>Reality</b> exists (at least, I suspect rather strongly that it does, and most people will accept it as a working theory) -- &quot;facts&quot; are ways we try to compartmentalize reality into comprehensible chunks. A factual claim can be <b>wrong</b> if it&#39;s a misleading partial map of reality, but I&#39;m not sure a fact can be entirely &quot;true,&quot; since it&#39;s necessarily incomplete and vulnerable to framing, prior assumptions, biases, perspective, and, of course, feelings.

 For the police patrol example, I would say it&#39;s a bad model. The model should understand not only number of reported crimes, but number of reported crimes per patrol. That way, an area with lot&#39;s of reported crimes and high number of patrols can be seen as having a similar &quot;crime density,&quot; if you will, compared to a low crime, low patrols area. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s even more info that should be considered, too.

 ...also, whenever Ben says &quot;facts don&#39;t care about feelings&quot; that should be read: I don&#39;t care about feelings. In the most literal sense, facts, because they aren&#39;t physical things capable of doing anything, don&#39;t care about feelings. But people, who don&#39;t care about feelings, can use selections of facts to validate their opinions.

 There&#39;s also how any practical situation on the real world is subject to a context, that is composed by MANY elements. Models will usually label those elements as subjectivity and disregard them, even though they are essential to have a full grasp on the situation. Calling a simplified version of the situation &quot;facts&quot; is not recognizing how we are limited in quantity of elements we are able to acknowledge, and that our biases will change how we acknowledge them. That&#39;s why science isn&#39;t an absolute consensus. Even math is a simplified model. You may have 1+1=2 carrots, but those carrots won&#39;t be the exact same, so picking the weight of a carrot and doubling it won&#39;t neccessarily give you the accurate weight of your two carrots.

 Speaking as a biomedical scientist - this video is great. People like to hail scientists as wholly objective robots, but of course we aren&#39;t. If those people were inside of the scientific sphere, one of the first things they&#39;d realize is how much scientists disagree! Obviously there are some things which have been robustly shown to be true - vaccines are good, in fact - but most science looks at smaller, more niche phenomena. Also, methods vary! Some experimental methods can be highly flawed, so the data produced from them may just be an artifact of that method.

 Liked the video and agreed with the thesis.

Crime was concentrated in those areas, and sending more resources there reduced it. The model worked. What alternative does the author suggest? As someone who has lived in a poorer urban area, I wish the police had spent more time in our neighborhood, and I&#39;m not a big fan of police. If that meant de facto targeting minority communities, I don&#39;t care. Theft was a serious issue, and it had very real negative consequences for the people who lived there.

 Thank you for this video. You made a very convincing argument :-)<br><br>One point I think was not touched on enough is that a distinction has to be made between &#39;hard&#39; science (e.g. what Newton did) and &#39;soft&#39; science (e.g. statistics, modeling). It is said that hard science is not able to predict, but only to observe (that&#39;s why climate change prediction is controversial, even though it is nested in fields of hard science). On the other hand, statistics is often viewed as an unwanted child of mathematics, or as a necessary evil (see &#39;big data&#39; in biotech and elsewhere). However, no hard scientist would just accept e.g. a prediction model of how a new antibody will recognize a virus to eradicate a disease, without attempting proof using methods of hard science. So your point of &quot;science is influenced by feelings&quot; is in my current view only valid for soft science, not hard science.<br><br>You might ask, &#39;but why should hard science be devoid of feeling then, if every decision made by a scientist takes feelings into account?&#39; This in my view is an issue of timeline. Science does not work in a way that somebody just finds the truth and that&#39;s it now. Instead, the scientific process demands vigorous attempts to disprove any conclusion drawn from scientific observations. Those scientific theories that have stood the test of time (e.g. natural selection or gravity) have been tested by armies of scientists deliberately trying to reproduce the original observations, expanding on them and - most importantly - trying to come up with different reasons behind the observations. By condensing all efforts - those in favor AND those against - the scientific process effectively cancels out individual feelings. As a consequence, the evolution by natural selection is, until disproven, a fact - whether you like it or not.<br><br>Expanding on this, we increasingly observe science in an up-to-date fashion - and not in a looking-back fashion as it used to be. Back in the day, scientists used to write letters to each other where they discussed findings etc. in private. Now, scientific studies draw media attention well before the scientific process can run its course for a time. And even in some parts of the scientific world (say, social sciences), studies are ever more quickly cited as a &#39;base of knowledge&#39; for further studies - in many cases without even applying the scientific process as laid out above. This effect is understandably more severe in those disciplines regarding fundamental science (say, social sciences) than in those regarding applied science (say, biotech) because applications are more easily falsified than scientific theories and - if disproven - generally do not tear down the &#39;house of cards&#39; of scientific theory with them.¬†<br><br>But still, in the eyes of non-scientists (which make up the majority of the population), there is no differentiation between hard science and soft science. There is just science, which can explain whatever the malevolent/corrupt scientist/sponsor wants it to explain. This lack of differentiation is in my view the main cause for the increasing erosion of the meaning of the word &quot;science&quot; and the increasing doubt about whether science is actually a tool to find truth, or rather a tool to prove your point.<br><br>So in the end, I would say that the controversiality (is that a word? sorry, I&#39;m german) of the posturing of Ben Shapiro is more an evidence of the erosion of &quot;science&quot; than of him being theoretically incorrect. As far as hard science is concerned, facts are not influenced by feelings and of course do not care about your feelings. But the data that Ben Shapiro uses is often not obtained from hard science after a reasonable run time of the scientific process - which in turn proves that he is human. :-)

In the last experiment, they trained the bees to come to a special place everyday at the same time, then flew them to the US (they were trained in Europe) and observed that they still stuck to the original time, aka, they had jet lag.<br>To me, this proves that bees rely on internal rather than external factors for their time keeping and so it seems to do to most people.<br><br>But ‚Äì and now I&#39;m getting nitpicky ‚Äì all we really know is that the bees in this one single beehive behave like that. It doesn&#39;t mean that all bees do. It is reasonable to assume they do (and it&#39;s unreasonable to assume they don&#39;t) but still: the proof is not objective. It&#39;s close enough (at least for me and probably also for you), but not quite there yet, and it never will be', 'Piotr Toborek', 'And what about the situation when 10 different groups around the world will try to disprove that particular paper and instead they will get same/similiar results?<br>Where is the confirmation bias in this situation when results disprove assumptions?']

 very well said. I saw many people now use &quot;objectivity&quot; as a buzzword just to paint themselves superior - which is a terrible premise to begin with.<br>I feel like whenever Ben says &quot;facts don&#39;t care about your feeling&quot;, it&#39;s more to shut down further discussion than to prove a point.

 How very, very, very, absurdly gracious of you to refer to Ben Shapiro as a philosopher. I get it though, this small phrase illustrates much of what Ben does and labels as discourse. The obfuscation of the actual meaning of words slightly to hide the putred ideas he is peddling behind them while casually slaughtering the concepts we hold as a group or society that give these words their deeper meaning and context. <br>It is very much like your example of conflating biological sex and gender, which Ben does in order to push the attempt at a transphobic worldview to his consumers while disgusting it as &quot;science.&quot; <br>While I wouldn&#39;t call Mr. Shapiro a philosopher, a grifter is a more appropriate term in my view, he is very adept at using language as a weapon while targeting audiences who are the most susceptible to that type of manipulation. It is the well worn conservative playbook with the tattered cover and dogeared pages. I just hate that this sort of thing still works on so many people. It seems like something so difficult to properly combat it is like punching a ghost.

 The bias of &quot;more crimes&quot; being used as a predictor of &quot;more serious crimes&quot; is a simple one to remove and in many police model examples it has been (crime classification). However, even with this, more crimes are detected &amp; prosecuted in the areas police historically looked for it and wanted to prosecute within. If you have a bias in your training data it is very hard to remove it unless you can quantify it. You also need to want to. If the machine gives you the answer you want then you&#39;ll go with it (the point of your video). The assumption that the people using the models aren&#39;t invested in perpetuating a system is... generous.<br><br>However, there are many good ways to greatly improve the impartiality of models. Ethics in Data Science is a bit and growing field.

People literally die as a direct, unavoidable result of the policies rich people push for to increase their own wealth.  But because they murder with spreadsheet math enforced by the apparatus of the state rather than by personally pulling a trigger, we act like they&#39;re not killing at all.  That, too, is a choice.  The status quo is not simply objectively the way things must be.  Whether we preserve it or not is primarily a value judgment.  Once again, human judgment is unavoidable.

I believe cops should uphold the current laws in society, and it should certainly not be their role to act as moral arbiters and try to decide which laws are just and not. It seems really dangerous and unjustified to give the cops that amount of power. Laws can be changed via the political system. And if what you mean by &quot;the destruction the rich cause&quot; is tax evasion etc. that wouldn&#39;t really be prevented by having more police patrolling that area.', 'Jemolk', '@Anders Johansson I&#39;m saying even the initial question itself is horribly biased.  The things wealthy people do are rarely criminalized, regardless of the destruction they cause.  By contrast, disrupting the status quo is often a crime, regardless of how beneficial it would be for most people if it happened.  Thus, the police are most often sent after the poor and desperate.  More crime happens in poor places <i>almost by definition,</i> because the destruction the rich cause is rarely made illegal.

 Thank you, this was an excellent explanation. I recently finished my PhD in Neuroscience and it&#39;s so hard to talk to people about how it changed the way that I view science. I still value science, but... it&#39;s not the thing that I thought it was before I had to actually do it. Every step of the way, from getting into a grad program, to getting grant funding, to publishing in a journal, etc. etc. is riddled with biases of every kind. Yet when I talk about this with some people, they will decide that science is utterly useless, and miss the nuance. <br>I&#39;m so excited for your next video! I&#39;ve spent a lot of time learning about science communication, and I&#39;m a big proponent of telling stories. It&#39;s amazing the pushback you will get from scientists when you say that, as if the word &quot;stories&quot; was the same as &quot;lies&quot;. A lot of researchers have an extremely myopic view of what it means to communicate science, essentially like you should beam a list of facts out of your head and into someone else&#39;s. This just causes the gap between science and the public to grow, because the best communicators and the best scientists are rarely, if ever, the same people. <br>I&#39;m so happy that the eyeballs helped me find you, keep up your amazing work!

My auto insurance was through Progressive so I contacted them about getting the insurance through them. A day later they called me &amp; said that the house we were going to purchase was unable to be insured until we ‚Äúfixed the front steps or installed a hand rail‚Äù &amp; replaced the roof. I was extremely confused because there were no steps at the front of the house, the front porch had fencing on it &amp; you walked onto the porch from the side, &amp; the roof had been redone by the previous owners within the past 4 years. I had no idea where they got their information from or how to respond since I‚Äôm a total newbie at adulting &amp; just basically said ‚Äúoh okay.‚Äù Out of curiosity I looked up the house on Google Maps, &amp; the photo taken said copyright 2013, &amp; in that photo there were janky crumbling steps at the front &amp; a shitty tattered roof. Going to guess that‚Äôs where they got their information lol needless to say Progressive did not insure our house &amp; they lost me as an auto insurance customer once that policy was up too haha

 As someone that works in science, facts don&#39;t really exist. Empirical data does though and data doesn&#39;t care about your feelings. But when they talk about &quot;facts&quot; they are talking about their interpretation of the data. For hard sciences like physics and chemistry the studies are quite irrefutable and can effectively directly answer the question. For instance if we observe that the climate is warming faster than we expect then we can test what may be causing that and show empirical proof that human emissions of CO2 are directly affecting the warming of our climate at a dangerous rate.<br><br>Sociopolitical studies are not hard science though and therefore leave a lot more room for interpretation than for empiricism. This leaves the &quot;facts&quot; that they are talking about to be littered with bias. For instance there is empirical proof that college educated people tend to lean more democratic in their political views. That is an empirical fact. The interpretation that &quot;colleges are indoctrinating people towards left leaning ideology&quot; is not a fact. It&#39;s a hypothesis created based off of that data. You could also make the claim that educated individuals find democratic ideology to be more conducive towards a better society but even that would have to be studied. That&#39;s where this idea of &quot;fact&quot; falls apart. How do you empirically study either of those things?<br><br><b>**Edit**</b><br>So I am seeing this comment getting some attention recently and I believe that most people, reasonably so, are not reading the entire thread for the conversation that was had on what I initially meant to say. So as to correct for this I am editing this to include a later comment I made clarifying quite a few things. Also anyone discussing the climate change portion of this comment i highly suggest visiting the NASA website for climate change as it gives a very thorough FAQ about the issue. <br><br>&quot;@Hagane no Gijutsushi  You explain my differentiation between what I initially addressed as &quot;hard&quot; science vs &quot;soft&quot; science perfectly here in your concluding sentence. Giving them the names of Natural sciences and Social sciences is much more appropriate and less problematic. In no way do I mean any dissent with the notion of soft it was simply an archaic term that came to mind and one which I will not be using going forward. <br><br>I should also really humble myself in this comment thread by instantiating that I am no expert on the philosophy of science nor have I studied the social sciences so my perspective is very limited. After reading through Ishan Kashyap&#39;s comments above I believe that I have dismissed the social sciences&#39; rigor in data analysis and the divide I have made between the two at times can definitely be seen as unjust or to David Kornfield&#39;s point as if I am making the natural sciences superior. I do not mean to do so. <br><br>Also I should instantiate that the initial point of my comment was simply to make the statement that empirical sciences are based on empiricism and then interpretation. Therefore the fact of the matter lies in the empirical data. My initial critique was mainly of the breakdown of science to the general public in that the public usually gets the flashy headline and a sexy article about the conclusion of the experiment yet the true details of the experiment is tucked away neatly in the fine print. This leads a lot of political pundits to incorrectly quote science. The irony is that my statement that &quot;facts don&#39;t really exist&quot; is exactly that headline and my real point is that when quoting &quot;facts&quot; you must back up your statement with proper empirical data and proper data analysis, which I never see in modern &quot;debates&quot;. Also a note here is that this refers only to empirical sciences so Logic, Philosophy, and Linguistics (I&#39;m not to sure I&#39;m using this one correctly) aren&#39;t being considered in my analysis. Therefore facts of reason and my take on the philosophy of science are not considered in this analysis. <br><br>Finally after admitting my own bias and lack of expertise in the issue I would love to talk from what I do know and learn about what I don&#39;t. In my perspective, as Hagane explained, the natural sciences study things that, for all intents and purposes, have exact characteristics. When I study a particle the mass, charge, and general state of that particle are effectively exact and therefore I don&#39;t have to consider those aspects as variable in my experiment. They are constants of nature. In social sciences there seem to be no true constants and therefore in order to simplify the experiment you must make greater approximations. These lead to higher uncertainty and therefore less precise conclusions. I do fear that my strict perspective of someone from the natural sciences may be skewing my analysis so I would love to hear from someone from the other perspective on this idea&quot;

I used some pretty niche lingo, and I maybe should have been more straightforward and a bit less tongue-in-cheek. What I meant by that is Dave Rubin&#39;s uncritical support of the several, ironically fraudulent, claims of election fraud in 2020. I also fail to see what civil wars democrats &quot;almost started&quot; over losing the 2016 election. I certainly don&#39;t remember disgruntled Democrat supporters who rejected the results of the election and of American democracy storming the US Capitol. Now that sounds like almost starting a civil war.<br><br>If people going around touting the &quot;Great Replacement&quot; conspiracy, vehemently opposing immigration and - implicitly or even explicitly - expressing support of ethnostates aren&#39;t far right to you, you literally have no concept of far right. What would constitute far right to you, what is the threshold? Fucking Anders Breivik?<br><br>Finally, you seem to misunderstand my point. My issue with Dave isn&#39;t that he has an opinion. We all do. It isn&#39;t even that his opinions differ from mine - even if I think some differ in pretty cringe ways. It&#39;s that he tries to cultivate a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; and &quot;open to debate&quot; image, when he&#39;s far from that. That&#39;s the difference between him and people like Harris and Shapiro. They also have their flaws, but at least they don&#39;t pretend to be in the middle of a road they&#39;ve veered off of, unlike Rubin.<br><br>I also find it hilarious that you know enough of me to say that I&#39;m Alex Jones. Can you point me to my conspiracy theory YT channel that I use to sell overpriced supplements to my deluded fanbase? Can you even point to some statement I&#39;ve made that could be even misconstrued as conspiracy? Please do, I&#39;d like to see you try to justify how I&#39;m a conspiracy theory lunatic.', 'Piotr Toborek', '@Henrique Pacheco You are first to give somewhat reasonable critique here, so that &quot;Nobody here...&quot; makes no sense because nobody here gave any merit, all these above where emotional insults.

This already hint at the the level of Your comment. Without rational argument slurs and insults is all that far left has...<br><br>1. What is &quot;anti-democracy arc&quot;? I would say it was &quot;anti-democrat&quot; if anything and it was well justified, because the democrats were actually &quot;anti-democracy&quot; with this idiotic election fraud. They did worse shit than Trumpers last winter and trash mainstream media helped them. It looks like You are anti-democracy as well. There was no mistake on Dave&#39;s side he was on TYT back then, probably less far left than You are currently. Or maybe TYT are also far right in Your opinion? Democracy is when side that loses accepts the election&#39;s result and tries to do better next time, instead democrats almost started civil was, last year Trump only tried to do what they tough him 4 years earlier. Mueller report is already out there.<br><br>2. If he would invite Cenk Ugyur, AOC or BLM leaders would that make him far left extremist in Your opinion, what about people who host both left-wingers and right-wingers? Neither Molyneux nor Lauren are &quot;far right&quot; as You said - You either do not know their views or are just unable to understand what they say in english (I wouldn&#39;t be surprised since you are too lazy to fact-check using web dictionary). Your point of critique is basically that he invited right-wingers and let them talk, with being dick like MSM anchors, who interrupt anything they don&#39;t like. So now You are not only &quot;anti-democracy&quot; but straight up &quot;fascist&quot;<br><br>&quot;More worryingly, when not on his show, he&#39;s more open about his actual political positions - which he doesn&#39;t actually hide on his show, thus becoming clear his bias towards rightwing political positions.&quot;   So it is bad he is honest with his viewers. &quot;anti-democracy&quot; &quot;fascist&quot; &quot;promoting lies&quot; - that&#39;s the game You left-wing loonies are playing.<br><br>And that is why neither Rubin nor me nor thousand of other center-left or center-right people won&#39;t treat you seriously.

You aren&#39;t homophobic by saying a gay person who yelled at an old lady for taking too long in the grocery line was an asshole. <br><br>Also, that&#39;s not what the word &quot;slur&quot; means. Slur and insult are different words, friend.<br><br>Now, on to criticizing Dave. There&#39;s of course, his whole anti-democracy arc, back when the results of the USA presidential election came, and he constantly tried to erode faith in our electoral system by misrepresenting the trustworthiness of reports we had about electoral fraud and ignoring the counter-evidence to the empty claims that would arise after (and sometimes even before) his coverage of them. But I could attribute that to a honest mistake.<br><br>There&#39;s his constant platforming of far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, such as Stephan Molyneux and Lauren Southern, whose claims he didn&#39;t bother to oppose at any point when they were in their show, leading to his show, which used to try to claim to be a &quot;neutral&quot; platform, essentially functioning as a signal-booster to rightwing extremists.<br><br>More worryingly, when not on his show, he&#39;s more open about his actual political positions - which he doesn&#39;t actually hide on his show, thus becoming clear his bias towards rightwing political positions.<br><br><br>All of this leads to the conclusion that he likes to pretend being an anti-ideologue who postures about free-thinking and the need to have open debate about political positions, but who doesn&#39;t really show any of that in his show or actions. His rightwing political agenda is - almost blatantly - a large influence in his actions and words, in spite of his pretense of neutrality.
