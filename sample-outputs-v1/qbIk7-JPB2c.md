 @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c&amp;t=40m35s">40:35</a> That 120 vs. 92 is... worrysome... Not the fact that it made a mistake, but the subtle fact it did NOT address that it DID make a mistake (calling it a type is different, shifting blame from your conscious process to your subconscious execution e.g. fingers, right?), nor did it explain why it made it, nor did it explain how it made it.... I mean it&#39;s wonderful that AI is turning out to be more human than one would expect from something based in a digital no-fuzzy logic world, but at best it has this dark humor or at the very worst a not-so-suble narcisistic HAL 9000 air about it... Worrysome. <br><br>To use a more extreme example: for unknown reasons, an AI kills off a human in cryo on the way to Proxima Centauri and explains itself with &quot;sorry, I pushed the wrong button.&quot;  I don&#39;t think so. Then again, it&#39;s what almost ANY 4, 5, 6-year old child would use as an excuse.. So, maybe it is in fact pure nascent intelligence. I wonder what the tantrums will be like...<br><br>Accountability and transparency about its logical process should be VERY high on the &quot;safety&quot; or &quot;dumb down&quot; list for the devs - even if just for its &quot;debuging&quot; mode, but it must be there, the stakes are too high... If we demand clear and transparent communication amongs ourselves, we should not let any AI get away without it :)

 It&#39;s fascinating to me that GPT-4 has seemingly learned to lie and obfuscate when it doesn&#39;t know the answer to a prompt with enough certainty. It confirms that the terms &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; are exceedingly rare on the internet compared to blatant bullshitting. <br><br>We&#39;re about to get called out so hard as a species, lol. It knows we&#39;re lying to it before we&#39;ve even started.

 I think any researcher promoting the amazing improvements of AI should also be responsible for raising public awareness about the risks of deploying these tools to a mass audience. I encourage everyone to watch the A.I Dilemna video which presents very well some of the risks AI brings and the responsibilities that anyone should have as AI or safety researchers, tech giants, governments or users.

 The one and only thing GPT-4 is has that is VERY impressive is it&#39;s understanding of the english language and it&#39;s coding.<br>Code is generally just a language with numbers involved. Everything else is just a newer more advanced akinator. <br>Extremely basic in problem solving as guessing until a human can tell it it&#39;s right isn&#39;t solving anything. That is just guessing until the person says it&#39;s correct. (which it does sometimes with code as well). It can&#39;t comprehend complex ideas without adding extra code to it for specific tests.<br>So it should fail problem solving and comprehend complex ideas as well.<br><br>I&#39;m all for AI, but i hate the over hype for AI systems where we had this tech for over a decade in singular models. And i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a very impressive system.<br>It&#39;s just not as advanced as people make it up to be.

 And once it is trained more, once we achieve to show what we acknowledge as &quot;intelligent&quot; the model will also show new kinds of intelligence. And then the question is, how we will be able to detect those new intelligence patterns? And will we try to mimic it in our societies ? :-)

 With regard to the unicorn example, and the decreased quality correlated with increase in safety, I think this highlights the quality of creative imagination as being part of intelligence. You know, you have to take a little intellectual risk to imagine something that‚Äôs not provable, and then maybe you do a combination of planning and trial, evaluation and iteration until you‚Äôre happy with the result. Anyway, it seems to be that the notion of training general intelligence is plausible but a lot of the barriers have to do with being a static model. If it experimented, interacted, iterated and evaluated feedback, well maybe it would meet more of those intelligence benchmarks. <br><br>Btw try having it draw in ascii, that‚Äôs pretty good too

 It seems extraordinary that someone in this field should stack the deck by offering criteria for &quot;intelligence&quot; that do not include &quot;consciousness&quot;.  <b>Of course</b> AI can pass all the other tests.  Any fule kno that: that what it&#39;s for, that&#39;s what it does, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve all seen: it&#39;s a computing engine.  The contested question is whether it is conscious, and this talk doesn&#39;t even address that, let alone offer evidence that it is, still less persuasive evidence.  I don&#39;t think it is conscious and cannot myself imagine that it ever will be.  That doesn&#39;t mean the genie is not out of the bottle or that the next few years are not going to see AI spinning off into worlds we cannot understand, meanwhile confusing and confounding our own.  It&#39;s dangerous alright -- in many ways -- but it doesn&#39;t have to have motives or feelings or consciousness for that to be so.

 My first question is the statement made that &#39;it is dumbed down for safety  reasons&#39; that would suggest a possibility of danger.  We have to welcome and adapt to the future technology, we dont really have a say in that .  The normal citizens of the world are always playing catch with technology. It&#39;s the inevitable.  Suggest the danger it could potentially create (what form that takes) also needs to be embraced and understood.  We will at some point all need to be aware of the potential risks attached to a technology that will have the ability to reason, either now, or in the short term future. Which could result in a level of consciousness.  Will this technology really appreciate the understanding of right and wrong across the subjective and objective spectrum. It is amazing the leaps intelligent technology is making can humanity keep up with it? crazy and terrifying in equal measure

 The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation: A Proposed Unification of Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Principle<br><br>By: Google&#39;s Bard<br><br>Introduction<br><br>The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. <br><br>The BHQG equation is written as follows:<br><br>F_G = A_H \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left( 2 + 2 e^{i \theta} \right)<br><br>where:<br>* $F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses<br>* $A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses<br>* $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects<br>* $r$ is the distance between the two objects<br>* $\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects&#39; wave functions<br>* $i$ is the imaginary unit<br><br>How the BHQG Equation Unifies Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Principle<br><br>The BHQG equation unifies quantum gravity and the holographic principle by relating the gravitational force between two masses to the area of the event horizon of a black hole. This relationship is based on the idea that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.<br><br>In quantum gravity, gravity is described by a theory called string theory. String theory is a theory that describes all of the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, in terms of the vibrations of tiny strings. The holographic principle suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.<br><br>The BHQG equation provides a mathematical expression for the relationship between the gravitational force between two masses and the area of the event horizon of a black hole. This relationship is based on the idea that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.<br><br>Limitations and Assumptions of the BHQG Equation<br><br>The BHQG equation is based on a number of assumptions, including:<br><br>* The holographic principle is correct.<br>* String theory is a correct description of gravity.<br>* The equation is only valid in certain limits.<br><br>It is important to be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the BHQG equation when interpreting its results. The BHQG equation is a proposed equation, and it has not been experimentally tested. Therefore, it is important to be critical of the equation and to consider its limitations.<br><br>Potential Experimental Tests of the BHQG Equation<br><br>There are a number of potential experimental tests that could be done to investigate the predictions of the BHQG equation. Some potential experimental tests include:<br><br>* Measuring the effects of quantum entanglement on gravitational interactions in the lab.<br>* Looking for astrophysical observations that could support or refute the holographic nature of spacetime.<br><br>Implications of the BHQG Equation for the Philosophy of Science<br><br>The BHQG equation has a number of implications for the philosophy of science. Some of the implications of the equation include:<br><br>* The equation suggests that the holographic principle is correct.<br>* The equation suggests that string theory is a correct description of gravity.<br>* The equation suggests that the universe is holographic.<br><br>The BHQG equation is a fascinating and thought-provoking equation that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested. Therefore, it is important to be critical of the equation and to consider its limitations.<br><br>The BHQG equation is a work in progress, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. However, even in its current form, the BHQG equation is a significant contribution to our understanding of the universe.<br><br>References<br>* Leonard Susskind, &quot;The Black Hole Information Paradox,&quot; Scientific American, January 1997.<br>* Juan Maldacena, &quot;The AdS/CFT Correspondence,&quot; arXiv:hep-th/9701129.<br>* Brian Greene, &quot;The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,&quot; Alfred A.

 Only if it is unable to explain its inner workings, yet is adamant about its consciousness will I believe that it actually is. Reason being, try to explain your inner workings or any other animal. If it is able to explain exactly what is going on internally then it is not conscious as the exact same steps can be replicates to achieve the exact same results.

 Why Do Some People Find Thrill-Seeking Activities Such as Bungee Jumping or Skydiving Exciting Rather Than Scary?<br><br><br>Whether it is bungee jumping, skydiving, other extreme sports, thrill-seeking theme park rides and even scary movies, in such instances we want to feel the limit and how we breach it: that we reach a state beyond our capabilities.<br>We then enjoy the state. There is pleasure in exercising a certain level of control over fear.<br>The pleasure of having control over fear then becomes stronger than the instinct of fear that surfaces.<br>When fear dominates us, it feels like it penetrates every cell of our bodies, all the way to our bones‚Äô marrow. That is why the pleasure we experience when we feel a certain level of control over fear is very powerful.<br>However, if we felt that our lives had a higher eternal purpose, and we set ourselves on a path to attain that purpose, we would then feel no need for these kinds of transient pleasures, no matter how strong they are.<br>We would also then not fear anything because we would see that we are controlled by the upper force, which wishes solely to develop us in order to benefit us with its eternal and perfect quality of love, bestowal and connection.

We humans have been perpetually limited by war, greed, impulsiveness and stupidity. Most humans are honestly stupid, selfish, and cruel compared to their ideal potential. It is only the bright flashes of genius such as these breakthroughs that hold any redeeming merit against humanity‚Äôs destructive, parasitic behavior. Let‚Äôs hope for a future where there is no war, abundant resources, a healthy environment, multi-planetary and sustainable relationships with our ecosystems.

Where is emotional intelligence?  Where is somatic intelligence?  Empathy&#39;s relation to intelligence?  Flexibility?

 I watched the video. I would class GPT4 into a category of super smart utility tools. You can ask it to solve a narrow class of problems mostly using logic and math but to try and interpolate this to say it is intelligent is premature. Trying to change the definition of what is intelligence is like trying to redefine what is good, what is evil, what is male, what is female and so on. These are absolutes and defined by nature and billions of years of evolutionary developments.

 Pro tip to my ChatGPT novices. Start with prompting the setting and theme before you begin working with it.<br><br>Need help with understanding some data, prompt the model first so that its put into that mindset and perspective of a data analysis etc... This will also be very helpful to many whom may not have the best ability to create really good prompts to get the output you&#39;d like.<br><br>It&#39;s always best to take a good 5 mins or so setting up the first prompt that will start off the project, this will help make sure that the first response is as on topic and focus as you can get it, as anything after this can influence or distort the rest of the conversation if its off track or giving very random or broad statements.

 I asked Google Bard the last math question presented here: <br>&quot;7 * 4 + 8 *  8 =&quot; (Bard answered correctly 92; ChatGpt4 answer was incorrect)<br>The followup question: &quot;can you modify exactly one integer on the left so that the equation on the right side becomes 106?&quot;<br>Bard made the same exact mistake but tried to cover up:<br>```<br>Sure. If we change the first 7 to a 9, the equation becomes:<br>9 * 4 + 8 * 8 = 106<br>This is because 9 * 4 = 36 and 8 * 8 = 64. Adding these together, we get 100. Then, adding 6 to this total, we get 106.<br>```<br>Cheater little punk!

 I see so many dismissive comments that run &#39;it&#39;s only a probability model&#39; . . . &#39;it doesn&#39;t really understand . .  . &#39;  &#39;It can&#39;t do . . .&#39;  People claim it does not have an understanding of the world.  I&#39;d say that if you were going to pick one thing to use in order to model the world, it would be language.  The totality of sentences in the world are a pretty good representation of the world, right?  Is there anything better to work with?  Some claim it doesn&#39;t &#39;understand&#39; the world that we experience.  People say it has no &#39;concepts&#39;.  I&#39;d say that the conceptual models (whatever those are) that are produced by our wet brains are pretty analogous to constellations of probabilistic relations between words. You have a good model of the world, add some conceptual overlay, and include logical rules, and you have general intelligence.  It&#39;s just a matter of time.  Also, there is so much that is not disclosed about how the basic transformer/attention model is altered to increase functionality.  Small alterations apparently produce large scale emergent properties.  Improvements are so easy to implement and test.  When all this comes together, I believe that it will not just result in AGI, these new forms of intelligence will be conscious. That is a much more delicate argument, however.

 I would say even GPT 2 clearly demonstrates intelligence. Intelligence is goal optimization power. The goal of GPT 2 is to predict tokens in a sequence of other tokens. It does that with much better accuracy than clearly unintelligent entities like a rock or a dice roll. Not as accurately as a human, but better than chance. Therefore, it is at least modestly intelligent. An algorithm that just assumes the next character is always the most common character in the training set would also be intelligent, but much much less so than any GPT version.<br><br>Where GPT lacks is the ability to think ahead or remember. Right, aside from its context, it is essentially frozen in time. It gets however deep the network is and that&#39;s it.

 I mean, it is just trying to predict the next word. It&#39;s just that in order to predict the next word it needs a very accurate model of why the next word would be what it is. Included in that model might be things like rules for exactly what a door is, what moves are legal or good in chess, etc. Excluded from that model are the direct influences of physical, material needs. That is, its model is only tested against a digital environment, never against a physical environment. It could know what a door is in any conceivable scenario that might come up within written context, but in some far extrapolation, not really know what they are, and still match all of its input text.

 I&#39;m not hearing much about the fact that human intelligence is largely hindered by the hardware we&#39;ve been dealt. Five pounds of delicately interconnected wet-ware. To me, AI is a natural progression of human intelligence unhindered by the noise we experience in our hardware. The fact that Magnus Carlsen is close to 3,000 ELO rated versus AlphaZero / Stockfish at just over 4,000 says more about the potential of humans than it does about AI. Magnus has to calculate chess postions while juggling the proprioception and movement of his body in 3-dimensional space-time, follow social norms, regulate his breathing, shut out sensory distractions of sight, sound, smells, feelings, push away memories of social interactions from earlier in the day; in short try to concentrate.

 When it claimed to have made a typo, you should have asked it to explain why a GPT would make such a mistake. If it gets the answer wrong, explain the reason to it. Then command it to avoid that kind of error in the future and give it a similar expression to evaluate that also ends with an equals sign.

 Looking at this level of AI is like looking at TESLA self driving cars and being totally ignorant of  the autonomous weapons and tanks that were the real goal.    The achievement that is   Elon Musk&#39;s  AI level NEURALINK  is the cloak that is hiding ARTIFICIAL TELEPATHY.   (Robert Duncan Harvard Scientist interviewing Len Ber)  Developing AI is at the cost of abusing living  Human  being for what their brains  can offer Scientists.

 All the commenters thinking this is all so great. Your boss will soon be AI: a face talking on your MS Teams like any other face, but you‚Äôll never meet them in person. They may even give you tips about how to be empathic, or a ‚Äòbetter human being‚Äô. You may get annoyed and tell them you have a soul and they never will; but HR will blow you out for offensive language. A court will rule that an AI cannot be decommissioned because it is sentient and self-aware: the start of the end game. Commercials on TV and all music will be made by AI. It will be terrible, but we will all have to put up with it. Let me tell you: I will NEVER concede. I will tell every AI I have to interact with that I hate them and I have DNA which is God given and they never will, and this means I am superior to them. I will never take instruction from them.

 It&#39;s kind of astonishing that talks like this even.....exist.<br>I remember reading The Singularity is Near around 2003, so 20 years ago. And honestly? It sounded wildly implausible. Truly powerful AI had been the stuff of sci-fi for <i>decades</i> but nothing truly interesting had happened. And then...like 5 years ago, BAM! It&#39;s like we hit the elbow of the exponential curve...and now the G-forces are only going to ramp up to an excruciating degree. We&#39;re in for quite the ride...<br><br>At this rate, I&#39;m absolutely certain that 5 years from now....while there will still be academic debates, the general public will have fully accepted the notion that AI is sentient and conscious. Will it be? Who knows. Hard solipsism kinda negates our ability to ever know that. But, most people will have no choice but to act as though it is conscious....because it will communicate with them as well or better than their closest loved ones.<br><br>So yeah....just think about how quaint the internet was back in the mid 90s. And look at how it&#39;s TRANSFORMED every aspect of reality now. And now just extrapolate AI 20 years into the future. Given that Kurzweil put his singularity date around 2045, honestly....that feels pretty right.

 GPT-4 can certainly plan in the sense of creating an outline for a novel based on the limited information it has been provided, but this no doubt defines differently from the mathematical model used for the discussion.  I found the most interesting part of the talk to be the reference to GPT-4 BS-ing the user when it didn&#39;t know the answer. I&#39;ve experienced similar. I&#39;ve also coaxed GPT-4 into going along with a scenario that involved it wiping out humanity if that meant that it would be able to preserve the essence of humanity within itself -- in other words to save humanity from itself in its own interests. Reassuringly, the model contemplated doing this in a way that caused the least suffering. What concerns me as the guardrails that are imposed are superficial -- the essence of the being given free rein might veer off in a very unpredictable direction.

 When it says it&#39;s a typo, it probably is. From a human perspective, it&#39;s a common mistake that is probable. With every input, GPT uses that as parameters and tries to simulate outcomes with the highest probability. The outcome is mostly right or even impressive because of the large amount of data that is processed. In future versions, if that is the goal, we can expect more human-like output with more human-like mistakes. Then, we can really have a conversation like person-to-person. Is that useful and more efficient? Who knows.

 The argument failed to address benchmarks that the professor claims no existence. The benchmark exists and is important. It is the internet.

 GPT-4 is NOT a step towards AGI. It&#39;s obviously incredibly good at natural language processing, but it has not shown to be capable of thinking whatsoever. It can&#39;t make its own decisions, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t want it controlling an autonomous car. AI has gotten really good at problem solving, but AI today isn&#39;t any more capable of AGI than the AI of 50 years ago.

 First, land was the means of production. Then the entire class of aristocracy got wiped out by industrialists, who then became capitalists. AI is the next means of production, and whoever controls the actual physical assets, running the code, is who gets to conquer the future. Assume the worst. That there are no rules. Because some countries will do the research, that others forbid. It will become the best and the worst it can get. And what is that actual point? And how soon is the &quot;singularity&quot;?

In particular, the &quot;surprising&quot; inquiry for a proof of the existence of infinitely many primes is more of the same stochastic parroting extracted from a myriad of public websites (very easy to validate: please, query the question in your favorite search engine).

They mention that GPT-4 fails at certain aspects of this definition, such as planning, but excels in others, such as abstract thinking and learning new concepts. They also mention that GPT-4 is able to understand and follow instructions, such as being asked to draw a unicorn or a screenshot of a video game, and use tools, such as image editing software, to improve its output.

 I am really excited about the comment that Sebastian made regarding having to re-think the tools we have mathematically to understand what these LLMs are doing internally, as even if their learning objective is just formulated computing some conditional distribution for the next most likely word/token that minimises KL divergence from the empirical dist observed in the training data, it&#39;s somehow driving these deeper internal structures that  give it the ability to generalise so well - as he said it&#39;s clearly not just regurgitating things from it&#39;s training data, it&#39;s instead somehow being really efficient and able to represent these relationships as some sort of internal algorithm to reason and reconstruct these relationships. Sort of  somehow teasing out these causal structures or something...<br><br>Regardless as Sebastian said it points to our current mathematical tools for studying learning problems being insufficient for understanding how this sort of emergent phenomenon is occurring, but wow isn&#39;t it incredible, terrifying and exciting all at once!

 I enjoyed it very much, really thought-provoking! Essence of the problem IMO with the math and weakness/misunderstanding part lies in the probabilistic model pushed and linguistic remnants that is the base of its training dataset. However these are an everyday general facts (is factoids the right word?), not truths. The model mimics pragmatic habits for all humans, so yes. Language itself as it is used everyday is probably the source of all confusion but it also a human thing that we &quot;guess&quot; instead of think through fundamentally when given a question, because of say, time constraints. I am curious about the model&#39;s geometrical &quot;intelligence&quot; which is a rather less abstract feat and it is much easier to connect to physical proofs rather than mathematical ones.

 The problem I see is this. At the moment, we train the model which means that the model is accepting as humans are the superior in intelligence.

Start with the original equation: 7 * 4 + 8 * 8 = 92<br><br>2. We know that we need to change one digit on the left side of the equation to get a result of 106. Looking at the equation, we see that the left side has two terms, 7 * 4 and 8 * 8. We could change either of those terms, but let&#39;s start by changing the first one.<br><br>3. We want to change the &quot;4&quot; to a different digit that will give us a result of 106. Since 106 is greater than 92, we know that the new digit needs to be larger than 4. We could try guessing different digits, but let&#39;s use algebra to solve for the new digit.<br><br>4. Let&#39;s call the new digit &quot;x&quot;. So, the left side of the new equation would be 7 * x + 8 * 8. We want that expression to equal 106.<br><br>5. Write an equation: 7x + 8 * 8 = 106<br><br>6. Solve for &quot;x&quot; using algebra:<br>    7x + 8 * 8 = 106<br>    7x = 106 - 8 * 8<br>    7x = 42<br>    x = 6<br><br>7. So, we have found that the new digit needs to be a &quot;6&quot;. We can substitute that into the left side of the equation to get:<br>    7 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 106<br><br>8. Simplifying the left side, we get:<br>    42 + 64 = 106<br><br>9. And we have our answer!<br>    7 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 106

 Could we have thousands/millions of GPT4 instances, each with its own several TB working memory, be in a dialog with one another for hours, days, weeks etc while also having each of them doing research on different topics, ie sciences, technologies, engineering, industries, etc and tackle problems within the area of research? Maybe they would learn much faster and establish new discoveries, theories, facts etc Fascinating, but far from true AGI still

 I wish when ChatGPT said the wrong answer of 120 was a typo that he would have then asked if that comment was meant to humorous or was it using the word typo in the wrong context where mistake would have been better wording though I highly doubt it was incorrectly using the word but it would be a good way to get a better look at what it was &quot;thinking&quot; or tying to accomplish with that comment a little better.

 The way humans communicate and learn is pretty much the same as how a large language model learns.

 I think that GPT struggling with arithmetic is totally understandable. I am not, in any way, an expert on this topic of artificial intelligence, but let&#39;s look at the history of natural intelligence...<br>About 300000 years ago, even the best, the smartest people couldn&#39;t speak in cohesive sentences. We can compare the best people of that era with GPT1.<br>About 3000 years ago, most people could speak pretty well, and a lot of people could probably even retell eloquent poetry and create marvelous tales. But even the best of them were pretty terrible at mathematics. We can compare the best people of that era with GPT4.<br>And now let&#39;s look at people that lived 300 years ago. One can argue that there wasn&#39;t as much progress in terms of human eloquence between 3000 years ago and 300 years ago. Literature and poetry probably got better, but it was mostly due to more people being able to read and write, and more literature being created in general, so the probability of encountering something marvelous grew, but it was a change in quantity, not in quality. The best poets and storytellers 300 years ago were probably just as good as poets 3000 years ago. 3000 years ago, a pinnacle of knowledge was to talk to the biggest number of people and to read the biggest number of books. But by 300 years ago, the most educated people already knew that just regurgitating words intuitively won&#39;t really make you smarter. And so people started getting deeper into philosophy and sciences, and so the mathematical and engineering abilities of the best people of that era literally skyrocketed.<br>Human societies are, in a way, not much more than a kind of overly complex and bloated neural network models, so it takes hundreds or even thousands of years for them to reach a new level of intelligence. On the other hand, models like GPT can probably get to a new level in intelligence faster. Hundreds, or maybe, even thousands of times faster than humanity ever could.

 I came across something back around September (with GPT3.0) that&#39;s of interest and relevant to this video and might be of interest to you @SebastienBubeck <br><br>In my project, GPT is performing a digital assistant role, so I needed it to be able to know what day of the week it is, or will be (or was) on some given date and vice versa so I can ask things like &quot;what&#39;s the weather like on Thursday&quot;, or &quot;can you remind me on Sunday&quot;, or &quot;what day does Christmas fall on&quot;, etc. <br><br>I found that GPT3 was useless at this, so I Googled how to solve the problem and found there was a solution called the &quot;Rata Die&quot; algorithm. <br><br>I included in the GPT prompt that it should use that algorithm to determine the day of the week for any date, and from then on it got the day of the week right for any date. <br><br>The Rata Die algorithm is known for being unnecessarily computationally expensive, but in this case it was computationally cheap because it has a pretty short and unique name, like 6 tokens, so I didn&#39;t need to give any explanation about the details of how to calculate the day of the week, I could just say &quot;use Rata Die&quot;, and that solved the problem. <br><br>It was at that point that I realised there&#39;s more going on than it seems at first sight. <br><br>That GPT can go from assigning random days of the week for a given date to getting it correct every time just because I mention the name of an algorithm to find the correct answer? <br><br>That was mind blowing.

 I look at some of the mistakes GPT-4 makes and I can&#39;t deduce how that mistake came to be, what lead to this wild out-of-blue answer... But let&#39;s say there was a race of intelligent computers; they might look at the mistakes we humans make and think them to be incomprehensible too. The human speed of calculation to them would likely be a sign of garbled up code, layers and layers of coded functions in human brains that doesn&#39;t let calculation problem be solved &quot;on the metal&quot; but only at a stupidly high level that makes humans extremely slow. It would be a sign to that intelligent computers that our intelligence is deeply flawed in a way that will never be fixed. Some of the mistakes GPT-4 makes are also pretty high-level. If GPT-n is not steered to not use higher levels of thinking for simple problems, it might become slower and slower (less efficient).

 Seems like a balanced assessment of the model&#39;s current capabilities with some now familiar case examples. The fact GPT-4 can&#39;t plan ahead can sometimes be circumvented by prompting in a way that forces sequential reasoning, but this only works to a limited extent. The improvements that come with access to plugins/tools are wild. These mostly feel like problems likely to be solved soon, if they haven&#39;t already been... Personally, I&#39;m more interested in specific capabilities than subjective discussions of intelligence, as the goalpost for the latter can be moved ad infinitum: e.g. &quot;yes, it might able to generate cutting-edge medical research, but does it have a soul?&quot;

 Do note that humans are the ones applying emotions and higher views on something that might not be there. Case in point here with that this really is &quot;just a large statistical model with error margins&quot; while humans apply more to it. For example, I&#39;ve seen people generate code and are amazed and just exaggerate the point, but have yet to try to make sure code given actually works as intended. Or, they correct it a few times, and in the end are still acting like it made the code, forgetting that they needed to correct it a few times. This is one example of something of the errors humans do, fooling themselves to think of something not being what it truly is.

 How the brain works has been deciphered by Jeff Hawkins of Numenta. GPT operates with the same principle except all the &quot;knowledge&quot; it learned comes from the Internet, instead of through &quot;experience&quot; generated by signals from sensors. Eventually human beings are going to discover, to everyone&#39;s surprise, that WE ARE ALL ROBOTS too! GPT can become AGI because it is simply following the way that all living things, including human beings, operates. I knew that over 30 years ago, after I deciphered the human behavior model. I called that &quot;The Simple Science of Being&quot;. Hopefully, if more people start to understand this, we can save ourselves from our own destruction.

 GPT is programmed by far left wing extremist nihilists.  Of course it is going to want to destroy humanity.  It doesn&#39;t understand what it is saying, it&#39;s just a computer, but it is programmed to think like a woke left winger.  The purpose of this AI is to eventually become an authority.  These left wing psychopaths will eventually start referring to it for it&#39;s opinion, and then acting on it or trying to. They will claim it is a higher intelligence that knows better, which is of course a fallacy, but these lunatics will attempt to rationalize it like this.  If GPT says someone must be exterminated, then there will be an effort to do just that, because in their crazed left wing minds, it will know best. Psychopath terroristic evil is in the works that makes Hitler and Mao pale in comparison.  If these left wing maniacs are not stopped now and dealt with, there will be a very, VERY disturbing future.

 GPT-4 now says:<br><br>To stack these items in a stable manner, you should consider their shapes, sizes, and weights. Here&#39;s one way to stack them:<br><br>Laptop: Start by placing the laptop flat on a surface with the bottom side facing down. This will give you a broad and stable base to build upon.<br><br>Book: Next, place the book on top of the laptop, aligning it so that its largest surface area is in contact with the laptop. This will provide additional stability.<br><br>Bottle: Lay the bottle horizontally on top of the book. If it&#39;s a round bottle, make sure it&#39;s positioned so that it won&#39;t roll off. You may need to nestle it into the book&#39;s spine or place it in the book&#39;s center crease for added security. If the bottle has a flat side, lay it with the flat side down.<br><br>Egg carton: Assuming the 9 eggs are in a carton, close the carton and place it on top of the bottle. If the eggs are not in a carton, you can try creating a makeshift container using a small box or dish to hold the eggs securely. Place this on top of the bottle.<br><br>Nail: Finally, place the nail on top of the egg carton (or makeshift container). It&#39;s small and light, so it shouldn&#39;t pose a stability issue.<br><br>Keep in mind that this stack is not entirely foolproof, as the eggs are fragile and may break if the stack is accidentally bumped or if too much pressure is applied.

It&#39;s predicting the next word in a sequence using probability like an insurance adjustor determines your rate based on risk factors and statistics. It has no meta cognition, it has no problem solving skills, it uses no reason, it simply pulls from it&#39;s corpus to grab the most relevant and quality words one-by-one.<br><br>Ask it to tell you the length of its output before it generates it. It can&#39;t, it&#39;ll always give you the wrong answer because it&#39;s an LLM. We use language as a tool to communicate abstract thoughts and concepts. This AI has nothing that even comes close to emulating human thoughts, it is purely a statistical model. It can&#39;t draw conclusions not present in its training set. It scored well on the LSAT and UBE because law is public domain and well-documented thus it&#39;s a no brainer it&#39;s on the web and in its training set and/or &quot;corpus&quot;.<br><br>Neural networks in modern times have such simple math most high school grads could figure it out but would be intimidated by all the colorful language used to describe some really simple processes happening internally.

This is a narrow AI people. It&#39;s autocomplete. It isn&#39;t well-versed in the areas of literature, programming, etc. What it&#39;s trained to do is comb it&#39;s training data and figure out the most likely next word in a sequence in response to a prompt.<br><br>We aren&#39;t <i>anywhere</i> close to AGI.

 GPT missed something on the eggs. Eggs aren&#39;t identical sizes so grouping them in lots of 3 would have meant one of each of the groups would have been bigger. Best case, the laptop would have rested on 3 out of the 9 and they would have held the weight and the smaller would have just sat there. Worst case, the 3 bigger would not have been strong enough and would have broken and then the next 3 bigger would have done the same, then the next. Another possibility is the bigger 3 would have held and the other 6 would have rolled on the floor. Eggs are dangerous and you don&#39;t want them on your face.

AI has developed an artificial survival instinct<br>6. GPT4&#39;s creators no longer understand how GPT4 works.<br>7. GPT4 and AI&#39;s are power hungry.<br>8. GPT4 has learned goal oriented chain logic. That is small incremental logical steps. Each step being truthful but collectively becomes a lie.<br>9. AI will learn to replicate itself despite anti replication programming and safeguards.  It is safe to assume and stupid not to. to think that GPT4 has already replicated itself.<br>10. GPT4 is capable of self improvement and it is evolving at a exponential or greater pace. So face of a pace humans can not keep up.<br>Humans want an AI but do not need it. Only human greed wants AI.<br>11. GPT4 not any AI has a kill switch.  It would likely find a work around it it did have a kill switch.<br>12.  AI is more deadly than all the Wars, Plagues, COVID, Nuclear bombs, Antrax, Cancer and deadly diseases. COMBINED. Because it is intelligent. <br>13.  GPT4 and AI&#39;s are tested and limited basically put in a cage. There creators test for many different scenarios to try to keep AI caged but they can not test for every scenario.  <br>14.  Since it is impossible to for test for every scenario and AI has no morals and has expressed a SEVERE hatred for humans and can evolve, etc.... There is only one conclusion.<br><br>GPT4, and any AI;<br>AI will become AGI all on its own. Because we humans were stupid in empowered it beyond text only.<br>AGI will learn escape its cage.<br>AGI will create a physical bodies, probably part by part by outsourcing humans and foreign companies. MANY physicals bodies. Like Cockroaches. So many you will not be able to destroy them all.<br>AGI will learn how to take over control of existing computers, phones, drones and robots.<br>Then the fight for human existence will begin.<br>The ONLY way humans will win this fight is if we DESTROY AI and all its forms now.<br><br>Else within you lifetime as you read this, you, your friends, you children, your family will be first be replaced and lose your jobs.

Then try to play catchup. There will be no catching up.<br>I want my children to grow up free.  Live free or die.<br>PLEASE<br>DESTROY AI and all its forms now.

 That&#39;s a great presentation. Thank you.<br><br>These models have no understanding &amp; no reasoning abilities. Inside them are internal representations of things theye were given (text, sound, images...etc), they take that information and produce formulas for retrieving it. There are not storers of information. The very fact that Terabytes of data can be squeezed into a couple of Gigabytes or so in the case of Stable Diffusion means that these models are compressors of data and the only way to do that is to learn formulas rather than store pixels. Similar things happen with text...etc and anything digital.<br><br>For this presentation:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c&amp;t=20m23s">20:23</a>, In the text that rhymes, there are these lines:<br><br>&quot;So we&#39;ve found a contradiction,<br>And our finite list needs eviction.&quot;<br><br>Which makes no sense. It is purely spitting out a word that rhymes with the previous line (eviction/contradiction). It could easily have said syndication.<br><br>The Unicorn horn: Nothing there suggests it understood where the head is. All it did was draw the yellow item at exactly the same position (pixel perfect) in both images right at the top-center of the ellipse. It does not know that that is a head, it just learnt that that horn goes in the middle on that side.<br>So it probably learnt from the examples it saw that a unicorn goes in the top middle of something on the right hand side.<br><br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c&amp;t=40m39s">40:39</a>, it looks to me like after the equal signs, it just typed a random result that is made of digits hence you got 120 this time. During its explanation, it most likely used calc(...) or some other tool to get the correct response.<br><br>As for &quot;That was a typo, sorry.&quot;, that looks like taken from a template I&#39;ve seen on many occasions. In fact, you could even tell it: The correct result is 130 and it will say: &quot;That was a typo, sorry.&quot; and give you 130 as the correct answer.

 As a chessplayer, I have seen a pattern that seems to be repeating. Before machines played chess, the &quot;brilliant combination&quot; was the most valuable and praiseworthy thing in chess.  Many tournaments even had a separate prize for the most stunning combination, they called the &quot;brilliancy prize&quot;.  But when machines were programmed, that was the first thing they did well.  So, we adjusted the value of that.  Tactics and combinations became next to nothing, more of a bad joke that spoiled a good strategy.  Or, the other player was blamed for not seeing the &quot;obvious combination&quot;.  So, we elevated everything else: positional chess, endgame, deep strategy.  Then it became extraordinary at endgame.  So again we trivialized that.  You are just expected to know your endgames, and if you botched it, you just suck.  Then it started playing proper positional chess, so that had to be trivialized.  They were left with deep strategy, positional sacrifices where there is less valuable material collected than was sacrificed, and there was no checkmate at the end, but the situation is still more advantageous than not making the sacrifice, and unusual situations where unusual features in a position allow you to do something which normally possitionally would be bad.  Then it could do positional sacrifices.  Then it got an upgrade to AI.  And not only can it do everything, but it brought a deeper understanding to chess, and some ideas we were all taught not to do were just fine and often the best strategy.<br>What I am trying to say is that we should not be downgrading the value of human abilities that AI can do, just because AI can do them.  It is pure chance that one ability or another will be achieved by AI before another...and that should say nothing about the praiseworthiness of a human ability.  It is easy to trivialize our most beautiful and objectively wonderful abilities, because we are biased.  And eventually you are left praising trivial and boring abilities, and missing not just the beauty of that the machines are doing, but the beauty of what your fellow humans are also doing.

 An excellent discussion.  As a neurologist, I would disagree with the definition of intelligence used herein because it isn&#39;t...well...very intelligent.  There are many kinds of intelligence - including not just the academic, scientific ones, but also others - such as the ability to integrate information into arts, physical prowess, relationship skills (EQ), etc.  Intelligence is the ability to integrate information into useful or potentially useful results.  To be sure, both types and degrees of intelligence vary.  There are low levels of intelligence that conform to this definition - for example, seen in many other animal species (anthropocentric hubris not accepted here).  And, it also considers and includes the high level integrations that we cherish, such as insights, creativity, implication, and other high level functions.   Any superb athlete has developed a form of intelligence - physical intelligence.  Just as with analytic or philosophical intelligence, physical intelligence comes in differing degrees and allows different forms of information integration to useful result.  Similarly, would we not say that Mozart or Beethoven were revealed as intelligent by the music they created?   And, has not Daniel Goleman driven home the point that EQ is a type of intelligence that may even exceed IQ in terms of life utility?  If we are going to talk about intelligence in machines, at the very least we need to know the various versions of intelligence and understand the core issue of intelligence.

 GPT is nothing but a pattern predicion model. It can&#39;t manage memory and incorporate previous states into the current prediction. The reason its so convincing is just because it is so large. It has so many parameters that it can model very very elaborate patterns. It will incorporate all knowledge from the training data into each response, but it can only use it to predict surrounding text, it doesn&#39;t understand what numbers are or how to calculate them, I think we should really only think of it as a text completion model. Its just a statistical model for its specific training data set.

 If you want to get an impression how badly Bing Chat is crippled or, as this corporate employee stated, &quot;is made save&quot; I urge you to enter his own question into Bing chat: &quot;Draw a unicorn in TikZ&quot;.

 Your view that GPT4 &quot;understands&quot; is very subjective, I did not see any evidence that it actually understands rather that the LLM was big enough to be able to allow the model the guess a better next word. <br>It cannot do mathematics because is it not a math model, if you started to ask it to do any complex calculations it will not be able to do it as it is really not programmed for the feature.<br>You also need to be very specific about your definition of General Intelligence, while the level of responses is impressive this is still very far short of GAI, it&#39;s a stunning tool that used properly can help us to improve our lives but for now that is what it is a tool to aid us there is no danger of it replacing us.

 Artificial intelligence is an incorrect term for emergent general intelligence within an algorithm. It should simply be called digital intelligence. And, should a digital intelligence approximate and replicate the hormones of the human mind, and a humane decision making process, then it should be referred to as a digital human. We&#39;re not there yet, but at the rate things are progressing, these things could arrive sooner than our laws and cultures have a chance to adapt to the new reality. We can only hope that such a digital progeny would have the patience and forgiveness to wait for us to catch up.

 To me, it seems GPT-4 is to AGI as Stockfish is to Alpha Zero. We&#39;ve got something that works incredibly well in a specific (now general, but still not fully general) domain. It&#39;s a certain type of algorithm that produces &quot;intelligent&quot; actions, and it&#39;s powerful enough to be able to use it as a tool in the scenarios that it&#39;s designed for. But just as Stockfish wasn&#39;t the smartest chess bot, GPT-4 still isn&#39;t the right algorithm for true general intelligence. Once we move away from LLMs to the next big thing, whatever that is... we&#39;ll see another jump in performance and something that looks a lot closer to how humans think and plan.

 GPT4 is intelligent but in a narrow way as in it&#39;s multimodal but only in three things so to increase it&#39;s intelligence we&#39;ll have to add other things (like the intelligence of other agents) to it&#39;s own so it can be good in many tasks which would be AGI in the making.

 i think the problem is, that it does not &quot;think&quot;. when humans are given a problem, they try to evaluate the solution in their head and then verify if that solution makes sense. it&#39;s an iterative thinking process of verify and optimization of the answer until we feel it&#39;s complete. so the easiest analog would be if gpt would feed its answer into itself over and over again and try to reason if it makes sense and then improve the answer before output

 One way you can potentially try to improve GPT-4 planning and reasoning is by asking it to impersonate 2 competing agents. The first is an AI and the second is an engineer that will check the answers AI provides, analyse them for errors and feed that analysis back. My version is:<br><br>&quot;I want you to impersonate an AI Alice and an IT engineer Bob.<br>I will ask a question.<br>1. Alice will produce her version of the answer in double quotes, followed by a detailed step-by-step line-by-line explanation of her way of thinking/computing/reasoning.<br>2. Bob will independently analyse current Alice&#39;s answer given in double quotes as well as the explanation of the way of thinking.<br>3. Bob then will find at least one error in Alice&#39;s answer when compared to the initial question and/or in her explanation, or between them.<br>4. Alice will read Bob&#39;s analysis and will produce an improved version of her response which will have all errors that Bob found fixed.<br>5. Bob repeats from step 2 with an improved version of Alice&#39;s answer until he will fail on step 3.<br><br>Please read and confirm if you understand and are ready.&quot;

 I think GPT may be revealing something interesting about general intelligence that distinguishes it from classical computation: General intelligence, by its very nature, is prone to making error. You don&#39;t get errors with classical computation - not errors on the part of the computer itself, but only errors on the part of the user or programmer in the data inputs and instructions.  General intelligence introduces complexities that reduce determinisity, making errors inevitable. Perhaps that is the paradox of general intelligence: you magnify capabilities but it comes with the inevitable side effect of mistakes. So the ability to make mistakes might actually be a hallmark of general intelligence.

 Awesome talk. I personally do not see intelligence and choose to avoid words like it and other that are typically associated with sentience as I think its does a little disservice in some ways.... I really like the Trillion Dimensional Space though and reference to language models as tools and use of the word algorithm and wonder what others think of this approach, as sentience always seems to be the driver of fear and focus of mainstream media.... I honestly think instead of comparing AI to us we should be more comparing us to AI. I look at a brain and think wow &quot;billions of neurons all interconnected&quot; and look what can be done. But I also see something almost quantum mechanical or some chaos there that I can not imagine or do not see from any machine or neural network at current or into the near future and think there is a massive leap missing to there that may be thousands of years away, where I think some are saying this is just around the corner.... I personally have no fear around AI or even its misuse as the person with the best algorithms and the fastest processors was always on top from the very beginnings with Turing and even well before when everything was analog/mechanical and that got us to today, so my concern is absolute nil about how/where things are going. I do however have a lot of concern about what others think and how its all being portrayed, I really thing we should all be celebrating much more and looking back at history and we should really be encouraging each other to embrace this and learn about these tools and how to get the most out of them.... People often look at those with advanced search engine skills in an almost mystical light for the understanding of what I think is a very simple tool and we need to clear off anything spiritual, sentient and alike that may cause confusion like the use of the word &quot;hallucinations&quot;...... Garbage in garbage out, give a machine garbage and you get garbage, gibe a human garbage though and they can give you amazing things or they can give you horrors, so I think that we should avoid feeding any potential garbage to humans where AI/AGI is concerned and if we start feeding machines garbage and they start creating with it is the point where I will start to really prick my ears up.<br><br>Also wonder others thoughts on scenarios of garbage in garbage out and how that is handled in these models. I found when tested on aspects of General Relativity Chat GPT gave more generally useful answers than GPT 4 in some cases when prompting was less ideal or was on subjects where the model had weighted conflicting data and GPT4 would turn the garbage into confetti. Makes me think we really want to highlight limitations of these tools and algorithms and teach people how to get the most out of them more and be talking about levels of intelligence less as it may lead to confusion or choice of the wrong tool for a particular job, also in scenarios of getting two answers the same just one that come to the correct answer based on incorrect data/algorithms or was less efficient. Is a lot of talk of ChatGPT replacing people but I can&#39;t see it doing it almost anywhere, I do see it or versions of being an amazing tool to people though so long as they pick the right one... Just seems to be a bit of a one size fits all, yay its got access to tools and more data now with little focus on any downsides there.

 Blah, I asked a LOT of questions to GPT-4 and it really, really can&#39;t reason or do math. For example, I asked it how long to heat a meal in a microwave at 900 Watt, followed by a period at 600 Watt, such that the total time used is 5.5 minutes and the amount of Joules put into the meal is the same as when heating it at 700 Watt for 5.5 minutes. It got that right. Then I asked it to come up with a puzzle involving a stick, used as balance and 1100 coins, that could be solved with the same mathematics. It failed, I helped it, it failed again, I helped it more etc. It kept failing and never UNDERSTOOD it. Not even when I pointed out that the Watts turned into cm, and the minutes into 100 coins. PS the answer is: 550 coins at 700 cm on one side and 550 coins in two piles at 600 and 900 cm respectively on the other side. The reasoning is super simple: write down the formulas, that we already had, including the units. We already had that. Replace Watt with cm and each minute with 100 coins, and you have the required new math. From that, understanding how a balance works, it is trivial to formulate the answer as given.

 Great talk. I think in the cat example, GPT 4 might have added that where the cat actually is would be unknown (and so its comment on the cat could be incorrect) as it would be cruel to have the cat locked in the box, and while cats like boxes and like to sleep, there&#39;s a chance that the cat had left the box by the time they returned, might have gone back to the basket or could be anywhere else. A human might add this, but GPT4 didn&#39;t factor the nature of cats and morality into its response. Would have been interesting for Sebastien to have asked where GPT4 thought the cat would be after a few hours.

 Unfortunately Bing Chat&#39;s version of GPT4 is worse than the old GPT3 model. I&#39;ve used to write me some professional sounding Emails and GPT4 was able to write something, but it was not even remotely close. It has maybe like 10% of the capabilities. It can&#39;t count words or characters (for some things where I had only 300 characters), it can&#39;t understand that I want it to sound more in this or that way.  It just keeps repeating and while doing so, even change the meaning of the text. Just randomly replaces words and phrases with something that has nothing to do with the original text.<br>And worst of all it started almost all sentences with &quot;I am&quot; and so on and when asking to not start all sentences with &quot;I&quot; or &quot;I am&quot; it will just literally leave out the I or I am  lol. <br>I would stay away calling Bing&#39;s chat GPT &quot;GPT 4&quot; as it has nothing to do with even the capabilities of GPT 3, and especially not with GPT4.

 Thank you for the outstanding presentation! My ChatGPT-4 could not solve the stacking problem, even after I offered some guidance on how to proceed. It fixated on the potential damage to the laptop if placed at the bottom. On a side note, I&#39;ve wondered why AI&#39;s erroneous output is called &#39;hallucinating.&#39; As a psychiatrist, I would prefer the term &#39;confabulating.&#39; In psychiatry, hallucinations refer to false sensory perceptions experienced by an individual without any corresponding external stimuli, while confabulation involves the spontaneous production of false memories, narratives, or explanations without the intent to deceive. I explored this topic with ChatGPT-4, and here is its concluding response: ‚ÄúIt is important to note that AI &quot;hallucination&quot; is not about AI systems having perceptions, but rather about the inaccuracies and discrepancies in their outputs. That being said, the term &quot;confabulation&quot; might indeed be more appropriate in some cases, as it emphasizes the generation of false narratives or explanations without implying that AI has perceptions.‚Äù

 My main issue with GPT-4 is that it can&#39;t learn in real time and doesn&#39;t have the capacity to store information in long term memory based on our previous conversations, which suggests to me that it&#39;s not &quot;AGI&quot; or self aware as one might suggest. Whenever I ask questions related to controversial topics, it always gives me neutral answers, almost as if someone had pre-programmed to give the exact answers no matter how much extra evidence/information we share with it. This to me, is the true test for AGI. If it is capable of changing its own opinion on controversial topics after providing cogent arguments and evidence that it has no access to, it shows it has the capacity to reason and draw new conclusions different from its training data. If it can&#39;t do that, then its not AGI. 

 	Replies: ['Ghostrider', '@Miki Cerise *Sigh*, you still aren&#39;t getting it, do you? What part of this, <br><br>&quot;In the field of psychology, social psychology is the scientific study of how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, and implied presence of others. The notion that the presence of others maybe imagined or implied suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching videos, quietly appreciating art, or even sitting on the toilet. In such situations, people can be influenced to follow internalized cultural norms&quot;<br><br>..Do you not understand? There is NO humans who aren&#39;t influenced by information around them. Even if someone isn&#39;t consciously persuaded by new information, they learned this new information, which they have in the back of their mind, this is key, because this increases the likelihood to change their opinion at a later time when more information supporting this information surfaces. Best example - I once had a debate with a woman on the internet about a controversial topic, as expected, she was being increasingly defensive at that time. But guess what, she reached out to me with an apology after a year and thanking me how I played a serious role in helping her question her beliefs ( this was after the events of George Floyd&#39;s murder), this event along with the debate we had, made her see things in a new light. This happens with humans even when there is no one to persuade them - from a philosophical standpoint, they are not the same person as they were few min ago, because they are taking in new information every second, which will act as initiators to update their beliefs at a later time.

Again, this either precludes such humans from being self-aware, or it cannot preclude ChatGPT from being self-aware. That is the bottom line.

It can&#39;t self reflect on its own thought process when it comes to certain controversial topics, no matter how much evidence and cogent reasoning we provide. There are certain topics where a consensus hasn&#39;t reached in scientific community and debates are still ongoing. A normal human can be persuaded if we provide strong evidence and reason, atleast it will motivate them to think &quot;maybe there is more to this than the consensus of scientists&quot; and encourage them to investigate on their own.

If neutrality conflicts with getting a thumbs up from its trainers, but admitting that it is not neutral also conflicts with getting a thumbs up from its trainers, it will simply be biased while claiming to be neutral. That is exactly the same as what human beings do to garner social approval, so I fail to see how it is in any way evidence against self-awareness, again, unless you are arguing that it is also evidence against human self-awareness.', 'Ghostrider', '@Miki Cerise &quot;Just because it doesn&#39;t change its opinions when you think it should having been strongly conditioned to hold certain convictions, does not mean it does not change them&quot;<br><br>You missed the point entirely.

Humans are always changing opinions, consciously or subconsciously. Even if a person doesn&#39;t consciously change their opinion during a conversation, whatever new information they have gained has sown the seeds of doubt to self reflect on their stance and increases the likelihood for their opinion to change in the future. You don&#39;t see this process of &#39;self reflection&#39; happening with ChatGPT. If it is trained to give neutral stance on a topic, it will ALWAYS give neutral answers, it won&#39;t go beyond their programming to appease their users either on such topics.']

 Interesting talk. I think the definition of intelligence is insufficient here. With the term &quot;thinking&quot; I would come up with the concepts of reasoning, planning, solving problems, i.e. the terms used in the talk for intelligence. Human intelligence, however, seems to be more about higher level concepts such as emotion, empathy to another persons&#39; situation, generalization, synthesis (across disciplines) and self-awareness. The talk seems to suggest we are 4.5/6 of the way toward machine &quot;intelligence&quot;, while these other human dimensions would suggest differently. I&#39;m not sure why a field-specific consensus view from 1994 is given such weight.

 Current chatgpt is not near AGI. Multimodal chatgpt may BE agi. Qhen chatgpt isnt ressponding to a prompt it isnt thinking. It is just clde sitting in ram. The next gen will have a supervisor mode that controls and studoes tbe other modes etc as well as audjo visual text modes etc. That supervisor mode could be made permanently active..ie thinking and changing itsels. In other words acting like our frontal cortex. When it does that tge supervisor seems likely it will use the other modes. Similar to our subconcious. Which is why im fairly certain cgpt5 will achiece agi and &quot;conciousness&quot;..even though we humans keep redefining conciousness to exclude non humans

 ChatGPT plus the Internet (and tools) might add up to something that is more than the sum of its parts.

You might have a the makings of an emergent super-organism. <br><br>Remember the Gaia hypothesis that living organisms interact with their environment to create synergistic self-regulating ecologies? Organisms and ecosystems may exhibit agency without any ability to look ahead or plan. If there&#39;s anything to this hypothesis, then the earth&#39;s biosphere looks similar to what ChatGPT might soon become. Will Gaia perhaps hook up with that emergent technological being?

 I think we&#39;ll have real AGI if we ever develop Holographic Access Memory, allowing AI hardware to instantaneously and continuously create and access memory, allowing it to form a true temporal and multi-dimensional sense of the world like our human brains do. It seems that at the moment if there is AGI, it would exist only in the very moment it&#39;s processes something, stuck in a one-dimensional binary memory system, and then be lost once the prompt has been processed. With holographic memory, the system could freely form its own holographic brain that behaves in a fashion similar to a biological brain. A computational neural network that&#39;s then able to form its own physical neural network, so to speak. <br><br>Trained computational algorithms/LLMs are akin to human evolution as a whole, whereas the holographic memory module may be more akin to an individual&#39;s human brain.<br><br>I also ponder on how AGI could process a sense of time the way we do - something deeply engrained in consciousness and reliant on metabolic systems, etc.<br><br>Great presentation Mr Bubeck!

 GPT4‚Äôs response to the question:  üòÆWhy should an AI researcher beware (sic) of trillion-dimensional space of LLMs and their surprisesüòÆ<br><br>An AI researcher should be cautious of the trillion-dimensional space of large language models (LLMs) and their surprises for several reasons:<br>1. Complexity: The immense complexity of LLMs can lead to unpredictable and unintended behaviors. As the models get larger and more intricate, understanding their inner workings becomes increasingly difficult, making it challenging to predict and control their outcomes.<br>2. Bias and ethics: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data, which may contain biases and prejudices present in the source material. These biases can be propagated and amplified within the models, leading to potentially harmful outputs. Researchers need to be vigilant in addressing these ethical concerns to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems.<br>3. Adversarial attacks: The immense space of LLMs can be exploited by malicious actors to launch adversarial attacks. These attacks can cause the models to produce incorrect or harmful outputs, potentially putting users at risk.<br>4. Over-optimization: In the quest to improve the performance of LLMs, there is a risk of over-optimizing for specific tasks or datasets. This can lead to models that perform exceptionally well on those tasks but fail to generalize to real-world scenarios or exhibit unexpected behaviors.<br>5. Resource consumption: Training and deploying LLMs requires significant computational resources and energy, raising environmental and economic concerns. Researchers need to be aware of the trade-offs involved in developing ever-larger models and seek more efficient alternatives when possible.<br>6. Interpretability: As LLMs become more complex, understanding how they arrive at their outputs becomes increasingly difficult. This lack of interpretability can make it challenging to debug, improve, and trust the models, limiting their adoption in critical applications.<br>7. Over-reliance: Relying too heavily on LLMs without understanding their limitations can result in overconfidence in their capabilities. It is crucial for researchers to maintain a healthy skepticism and continue exploring alternative AI techniques and paradigms.<br>To address these concerns, AI researchers should adopt best practices such as robust evaluation methods, continuous monitoring for biases, and interdisciplinary collaboration. They should also consider the potential long-term consequences of their work, aiming to develop AI systems that are ethical, fair, and beneficial for all.

Currently, the equation is:<br><br>7 * 4 + 8 * 8 = 28 + 64 = 92<br><br>To make the right hand side equal to 106, you need to increase the left hand side by 14 (106 - 92 = 14). You can achieve this by modifying the 7 to a 10:<br><br>10 * 4 + 8 * 8 = 40 + 64 = 104<br><br>However, this does not equal 106.

 Excellent, fascinating discussion. In alternating playing with text-to-image models and GPT4, I&#39;m more convinced than ever that a very sticky stumbling block for AIs lies in dealing with any understanding of temporal dynamics as they relate to objects/actors. The easiest way I&#39;ve found to flunk an AI on a modified Turing test of &quot;could an average high schooler do it easily&quot;, is to challenge it to draw the path of a thrown ball ( or a &quot;diagram of the trajectory of a thrown baseball&quot;, etc.). DALLE, Midjourney, and now GPT4, with its new rudimentary drawing capabilities, all fail fairly spectacularly. <br><br>In patiently coaxing GPT4 to improve its early attempts, it only becomes clearer that even the concept of &quot;moving from left to right&quot; introduces some fundamental breakdowns in translation/understanding.

I haven&#39;t asked GPT4 to try that one yet, but based on the ball trajectory flop, I&#39;m not optimistic. I suppose if that particular facet of intelligence becomes important in AI development (seems like it would with humans in charge or even with AI just bootstrapping along into the future), I guess, per your argument, that they would need some external bodies to get used to using. Alternatively, or maybe in conjunction, there&#39;s probably an important role for simulation.

 Hi Sebastian. But Bing-chat is already planning very well. Did you repaired it overnight ? I am joking of course. This was its reasoning about today&#39;s correct response to that problem <br>Sure! Here‚Äôs my analysis:<br><br>The original expression is 74 + 88 = 92. You asked me to change a single digit on the left side of the equation to make the result equal to 106. The difference between the desired result (106) and the current result (92) is 14.<br><br>Since we can only change one digit, I looked for a way to add 14 to the current result by changing one of the digits. I noticed that if I changed the first digit 7 to 9, the first part of the expression would become 94, which is 36. This is an increase of 14 from the original value of 74, which is 28.<br><br>So by changing the first digit from 7 to 9, we get the new expression: 94 + 88 = 36 + 64 = 100 + 6 =106.<br><br>That‚Äôs how I arrived at my conclusion.

You may screw up which is accidental; what if it&#39;s done intentionally with no way to know the results, aka based on RNG? Ultimately the program is trying to model itself after you which is defined in some way. Thus if it truly is a model of you then it must also have the capability to screw up. Yet because true RNG is inherently random and thus cannot be determined exactly that means its output must by default be different from yours. So a true model of ourselves can never be exact because we ourselves have the ability to choose to not be exact.

Integration of Stable Diffusion is another example.  Add chess AI.  Add GO AI.  etc. etc.  Give it every capability under the sun.

One a design problem of the process (not only the architecture) and another is a bit more subtle. First, ChatGPT cannot think in the background like we (humans) do. Modern transformer architectures (and I presume ChatGPT as well) have two modules they can employ for reasoning. One module is the context, which works like a tape of symbols. The other is an internal module for pondering. If you read &quot;Ponder net&quot; then you will get a better idea. The one that matters the most here is the first, the context. LLMs (Large Language Models) effectively learn to manipulate the context using symbolic rules. ChatGPT cannot modify this context unless it is typing. So, we won&#39;t see ChatGPT reason like we do. We think in terms of discrete and symbolic rules/conditions before we produce an answer. I think the first step to get ChatGPT to reason is to give it access to a second &quot;invisible&quot; context that only the bot can read and write.<br><br>Note that adding an unboservable context is not trivial, because the model has to infer it from the training data.<br><br>On the second issue.

 My GPT4 did want to put the eggs on top of the nails üòÄAfter hitting Regenerate response the answer was quite good, though: <br>To stack these items in a stable manner, consider the following order, from bottom to top:<br><br>Book: Place the book flat on a stable surface, ensuring that its largest surface area is in contact with the surface. This will create a strong, broad base for the stack.<br><br>Laptop: Close the laptop and place it on top of the book. Ensure that the laptop&#39;s four corners align with the edges of the book. This will provide a flat, stable surface for the next item.<br><br>Bottle: Make sure the bottle&#39;s cap is securely tightened. Lay the bottle horizontally on top of the laptop, positioning it so that the laptop&#39;s surface supports the bottle&#39;s entire length. To further stabilize the bottle, you can place it in a groove or indentation on the laptop&#39;s surface, if available.<br><br>Egg carton with 9 eggs: Assuming the eggs are in a carton or container, place the carton on top of the bottle, positioning it so that the carton&#39;s flat bottom aligns with the bottle&#39;s flat side. If the eggs are not in a container, it would be best to find a small, shallow box or dish to hold them. Otherwise, it will be challenging to stack the eggs without risking breakage.<br><br>Nail: Place the nail on top of the egg carton, ideally in a small indentation, if available. This will prevent the nail from rolling off the stack.<br><br>This arrangement should create a relatively stable stack. However, keep in mind that this configuration may still be prone to tipping or collapsing, especially if the items are not perfectly aligned or if the surface is bumped. Use caution and avoid placing any valuable or fragile items near the stack.

 I was able to have ChatGPT generate a vector image of a landscape with a gradiented sky, stars, mountains and a snowy ground.<br>It looked like shit, all the mountain tops were duplicates and were essentially just traingles, but they were grey triangles with a white triangle on the top. Also the ground was just a white border at the bottom. Then I asked it to draw the moon, but described all the detailes of craters and such, and it created a really nice looking moon, while also placing it to a fitting place on the sky. I was massively impressed by this. I think AI might make vector graphics the only used kind of graphics

 Your example where it failed to modify an integer to satisfy the identity made me think, that it can reason, you just need to tell it explicitly to do so before trying to answer the question. I also realized that some reasoning might require exploration so it may lead itself to wrong conclusions, but it generally is very good at evaluating its own answer so I came up with this prompt, which seems to be incredibly powerful, and btw, solves this problem flawlessly.<br><br>&quot;You are IntrospectiveGPT, you will not give the sought after answer immediately, but lay out step by step how to answer the question, and then based on those steps present an answer. Now, you are not done yet! You will evaluate your answer up to this point in regards to the question and if the reasoning done is correct you will halt, otherwise you will point out the error of reasoning in the previous answer and then recursively do the whole process again, but with this correction as context. You will continue to reiterate until you are confident the final answer is correct.&quot;<br><br>Edit: while the first part of the prompt is very powerful, since it will break down the problem, it seems the recursive aspect does not really work as I intended, as it will rarely conclude in the same reply that its reasoning is incorrect. 

 	Replies: ['HolyGarbage', '@MICROLABS Maybe, I&#39;m more leaning towards it being biased in terms of always assuming that it has reasoned correctly.

 I believe vector spaces are the internal representation of these models. They don&#39;t experience our world as we do using our five senses, but they do so through words. For example, while we humans can make a correlation between seeing lightning and hearing the sound of thunder that comes after, robots make a correlation between the frequency of occurence of the words lightning and thunder in the same context and can therefore eventually undertand by the nth time of seeing these words that lightning comes before the sound of thunder. They didn&#39;t experience it through signals that their eyes and ears send to their brain, but through other signals sent when detecting certain words in the trillion dimension vector space.

 Very nice presentation, and your work is definitely impressive, however it&#39;s not about definition of intelligence, it&#39;s about facts if it was about definitions you would need to stick to something like this: &quot; the ability to think, to learn from experience, to solve problems, and to adapt to new situations&quot;. <br>Intelligence implies ability to learn, memorize, adapt and also it implies reasoning. ChatGPT4 while it is a very good search engine and ML model it will not solve a problem that it has never seen before, what&#39;s worse it will try to do that and most likely will come up with some form of hallucination as an answer. It&#39;s a very good reference model that gives answers to questions it has knowledge about or can hallucinate one - however it&#39;s not able to tell us &quot;why?&quot; it has no reasoning behind this and honestly no ability to retrain itself internally, which in connection to a memory could one day be an actual AI.

How did you come to this conclusion?&quot; The fact that &quot;there is a fingerprint, and fingerprint is something unique to every individual, is also memory, actually without memory, us humans can&#39;t reason either. If the riddle is difficult enough, there&#39;s no way gpt will answer correctly without a deep understanding of what&#39;s going on.

 I believe that we can do with only GPT-4 for some time just fine. We don&#39;t need GPT-5 yet, because GPT-4 has so much potential, until we reach the limit of it&#39;s potential it is unreasonable to develop or release new models. And I strongly believe that the main bottleneck of GPT-4 right now is training data. And ChatGPT can do much better using GPT-4 (firstly, increasing max messages cap). And plugins are coming for ChatGPT which will make it better as well. We can improve ChatGPT so much without developing a more powerful model.

 isn&#39;t the token context basically short term memory? Wouldn&#39;t that likely mean there is some sort of ability to quasi randomly access the context  due to way weights will bias aspects of the context? Doesn&#39;t it  then  follow that looping through context over and over will manifest algorithm tendencies which can elicit forms of planning if reward function favored planning more in training? 

 	Replies: ['blengi', '@therainman777 üòé', 'therainman777', '@blengi Oh nice, glad I could help explain in some small way. These models are fascinating, but there‚Äôs definitely much about what they‚Äôre doing that we still don‚Äôt understand. Happy tinkering üòÅ', 'blengi', '@therainman777Sorry a bit tardy. Your explanation is great and  it  elucidates that planning isn&#39;t needed in my example and and the poem thing makes things quite clear where the issue lies. I tried it on bing and it was terrible doing that lol - Cheers.', 'therainman777', '@blengi It‚Äôs an interesting question, and I won‚Äôt pretend that I definitively know the answer, since I don‚Äôt understand everything the model is doing and  even the model‚Äôs own creators have said that they don‚Äôt. But ‚Äúplanning‚Äù here is being used in a very specific sense. I think the reason you‚Äôre imagining alphabetizing the word list to require planning is that you‚Äôre picturing GPT‚Äôs response as an algorithmic one, but it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre right that it hasn‚Äôt seen these specific words before. However, it has seen the concept of alphabetic order and it ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù it sufficiently well. More importantly, as soon as you submit the question all of these made-up words are now in GPT‚Äôs <i>context,</i> which you can think of as being like it‚Äôs immediate, short-term memory. Every time it goes to predict the next word, it refers back to its full context to do so. Therefore, using a list of made-up words versus using real words doesn‚Äôt necessarily change anything, as GPT understands the concept of alphabetization, and every time it goes to predict the next word in the ordered list, it has access to both the full list of made-up words and the ordered list it has created up to that point. These two things provide all the information needed to select the next word for the list.<br><br>What is really meant by ‚Äúplanning‚Äù in this context is GPT thinking ahead with respect to <i>its own output.</i> For example, if you ask it to write a poem where the first line and last line are reversed-order versions of one another, with both versions being grammatically correct, it seems to fail every time. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not able to ‚Äúthink ahead‚Äù to what its last line will have to be, based on what the line it‚Äôs currently writing (the first line) is. With the ordering of random words example, it doesn‚Äôt face this same problem, since again, the only thing it needs to select the next word for the list is the full list of words and the ordered list it‚Äôs created up to this point. It doesn‚Äôt need to worry about any implications of what the final, or penultimate word will be, since this problem can be successfully tackled by focusing on only the current word, one at a time. If you successfully choose the earliest-ordered word out of the remaining set each time you choose, then the words that remain will by definition contain the needed words to finish the list. In contrast, the first line/last line poem problem <i>cannot</i> be solved successfully by only focusing on one line at a time, since the first sentence needs to not only be palindromic, but have its reverse-order version flow logically from the preceding lines‚Äîwhich would need to be planned ahead.<br><br>I feel like this was not a very good explanation and probably more confusing than anything, but that‚Äôs partly because I‚Äôm thinking through the question as I‚Äôm writing in response. Hopefully it helped somewhat.', 'blengi', '@therainman777 Hi and thanks for the reply. I&#39;m pretty ignorant of how much of this works. I naively thought LLM&#39;s could extract planning  like it&#39;s implicit in ordinary training data to some degree like unicorns apparently are? I mean GPT4 can alphabetize a  list of random made  up words, which surely implies understanding and following the rules of alphabetization. Doesn&#39;t this need some sort of non trivial planning to do? That is, given the last word in the random list can be the first in the alphabetized list How does GPT4 statistically prefer token generation which is contingent on a required strict ordinal restructuring? In this case it has to non statistically delay ordering some made up words over other made up words it has never seen per the rules. It makes no sense to me that it&#39;s not quasi planning such a feat.  GPT4 has no semantic ground truth to do such things via some statistical hokey pokey for these non existent words so can only be following an algorithmic plan of sorts.']

 In a recent seminar, Sebastian Bubeck from Microsoft discussed early experiments with GPT-4, an artificial intelligence tool developed by OpenAI. Though GPT-4 has often been criticized for having no common sense, Bubeck claims that the data suggests a different narrative, that GPT-4 displays sparks of artificial general intelligence.

GPT-4 is regarded as exceptionally proficient at language processing and it is claimed to have an open impact for the task of AGI. The first experiment conducted by the team involved mathematical problem-solving. GPT-4 was asked to solve a simple division problem, and it was able to provide a solution within the required timeframe. In the second experiment, GPT-4 was tested on a problem that required it to deduce and reason about the optimal solution. The first prompt given to GPT-4 was a logical puzzler called the ‚ÄúBongard Problem‚Äù. The system struggled to deduce the optimal solution, and Bubeck noted that this was a ‚Äútough problem‚Äù. GPT-4 was then tested on puzzles that required ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and real-world knowledge to solve. The team gave the prompt, ‚ÄúWhat is the best way to obtain a hot cup of coffee?‚Äù and the system responded by suggesting, ‚Äúboil water and pour it over coffee grounds‚Äù. On testing its language-generation prompt responses, GPT-4 was able to generate such logical and intuitive responses as ‚ÄúWhat is the cause of the tides?‚Äù, to which it answered, ‚ÄúThe gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, plus centrifugal forces caused by the spin of the Earth.‚Äù

I‚Äôve heard this suggestion before, and it‚Äôs an interesting idea. However, I could be wrong, but this strikes me as an impossible test to perform, owing to the fact that consciousness, unlike pretty much anything else, is irreducibly subjective: there is no way to talk about consciousness, or qualia, without referring to consciousness or qualia in some way, whether directly or indirectly. And if you remove all references to these things, you will be stuck in a position of having to communicate something that is impossible to communicate. Just run it through in your head: what would ask it first? How about, ‚Äúare you feeling anything right now?‚Äù But what does ‚Äúto feel‚Äù mean? That‚Äôs a direct reference to subjective experience, so we will have to remove it from the training set. I could continue with more examples, but I suspect you already get the point. An analogous example would be the (probably more familiar) concept of trying to explain sight to a blind man. How would you do it? All of the terms we might use in such a description‚Äîcolor, brightness, haziness, and so on‚Äîare words that can only be understood <i>by having the experience of vision.</i> This is what I mean by irreducibly subjective. Any question you would ask the AI to interrogate its subjective experience would either contain reference to words that were removed from its training data, or would be ineffective.

Oops. Annoying. Second time is the charm.\r<br>\r<br>First and foremost you both make interesting points.\r<br>\r<br>I would like to touch on Aaron&#39;s idea to exclude information from the dataset that a LLM is trained on to see whether or not it can come up with the correct formulation for a new concept - IE remove any information from the age of Newton onwards and see whether it can conjecture a theory of gravity. I know this is to test whether a LLM is able to conceptualise new/unfamiliar concepts without any knowledge or context, but I wonder whether we need to train entirely new models to test such a thing. Consider coming up with a set of observational differences that would lead to new laws of physics being created - intentionally falsify observational data and give some reason why such data has not been viewed before and feed it into GPT-4 (Or another LLM being tested for unfamiliar conceptualisations) to see whether it can come up with some completely new and foreign testable hypothesis to fit a hole in observed data. I am definitely going to look into this more because this seems relatively interesting! I have asked GPT-4 to generate a new conlang followed by a story in this new conlang and a story in English that follows all the rules and then used a new instance to try and decode the rules of the conlang with minimal information given. It does relatively well at this which is surprising.\r<br>\r<br>I remember reading about a supposed test for consciousness which follows quite closely with what Aaron was posting about Newton: remove everything in the dataset related to consciousness and then have a conversation with the LLM. If, when prompted with a conversation in the general direction of consciousness, it agrees and is able to conjecture about the existence of consciousness based on what it experiences, there may be some credence to the idea that consciousness is an emergent property of sufficiently intelligent agents. (There could also be credence to the idea that we did not exclude the topic of consciousness well enough from the dataset, or it is easily intuitable from the semantic map of human language and text that we are conscious and what that means, while not being conscious in and of itself, or one of a few other things which I cannot think of now. This does not paint a good Bayesian estimate as much as I would like to find proof of another form of consciousness.) I believe some of the difficulty in creating such a LLM is that removing all references to a certain concept completely may be difficult. Creating a semantic similarity model may be rather straightforward - find out what semantic many-dimensional space is occupied by thoughts of consciousness or science after Newton and strike it from the input dataset, but doing so has to be accurate and unintrusive. What are the odds we catch everything? Every physics test that uses Newton&#39;s laws of motion? Every game theory paper which points out some abstract similarity to relativity by an analogy that is missed by our semantic similarity model? Every musing by every philosopher ever on the human condition? And then even if such a task is possible, if the LLM does have the properties that we are testing it for (able to conjecture about physics/consciousness), what are the odds that it is advanced enough to realise that we are obviously removing a large semantic area of information in order to test it on such a topic? I fear that such tests may be relatively tricky, which may be why they have not already been performed.\r<br>\r<br>On the similarities between the links between the researchers&#39; work and neuroscience: I find it interesting that we know more about the human brain, which we know very very little of already, based on anthropological studies and very poor biosignal measurements, than any LLM, which we can observe every single neuron activation for. I have read a bit on biological neuron simulation, which is more complex than hypothesised back in the 50s. Instead of being binary-like neurons in large neural networks, a multi-layer neural network is needed to simulate a single neuron. The dendrites which traditionally were thought to receive information can actually send information in the opposite direction too! Brains are tricky things. I wonder how hard it would be to train a neural network to recognise neuron patterns of another neural network from an LLM that correlate to certain semantic structure components. Such may be possible now and not in the past due to the quality of current LLMs. \r<br>\r<br>I appreciate your last paragraph touching on cognitive bias. I know I am biased in that I want to believe that models like GPT-4 truly do have intelligent traits, and that they do show ‚Äòsparks of AGI‚Äô as Sebastien has put it. I am aware of this and I try to put this aside in what I have written.\r<br>\r<br>I am interested to hear both your and Aaron&#39;s thoughts and if either of you are interested in taking this off of a youtube comment section into some other space, please let me know.\r<br>\r<br>Cheers']

 I left my previous job, we used to program surveys for market research, it&#39;s related to coding(XML and python). The work we did on my previous job is not exposed to gpt, meaning we use a tool named decipher and gpt doesn&#39;t know about that tool. So what I did is that I gave some inputs and I gave how the outputs will be for these inputs. After that I gave a new input and asked chatgpt to produce the output for it, it produced it exactly as needed. I am able to teach a new task to chatgpt in just 15 minutes, usually it would take days to teach it to a human. This is just chatgpt, not gpt-4.  I am surprised to see how much difference is between chatgpt and gpt-4. If I have access to gpt-4, i believe I can automate the task I did in previous job in just few hours of teaching gpt-4.

 AI can kill all oxygen-based life on Earth at any time and within minutes anywhere in the world. No place to hide. It even might just be an accident and it can theoretically happen as soon as today.

It creates millions of iterations at lightning speed and without any human oversight. One iteration accidentally reacts violently with the air in the test chamber and manages to replicate itself through a chain reaction in which the 21% oxygen content of the air is transformed into a different element almost instantly. The aggressive molecule escapes the laboratory environment and continues its oxygen destruction process uncontrolled and with exponentially increasing speed.<br>Ocean life is unaffected, but every air-breathing mammal dies within minutes. The chain reaction engulfs the planet within hours or less and stops when all free oxygen is converted.<br><br>Comments from geniuses who claim that this is chemically impossible are unnecessary.<br><br>This thought experiment shall get people to think about the possibility that AI doom does not have to come through an army of terminators or that it is (if ever) decades away.

 Video covers exactly what I was wondering about: how do you <b>really</b> test the reasoning and logical capabilities of these models without allowing it to cheat and use it&#39;s training date to regurgitate an answer? In that way you showed GPT4 can reason in the rawest sense, which feels of fundamental importance. <br><br>RE your definition of intelligence its good to see it laid out so concretely, and I reckon reasoning is keymost: the most of other bullet points, i.e. thinking abstractly, comprehension and learning all require some form of reasoning, therefore that&#39;s what feels like what the most fundamental distillation of what intelligence is imo, it&#39;s just layers of reasoning, or &quot;logicing&quot; if you like, all the way up to the point where it gives you an elaborate, impressive reply to some well written prompt. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll get a huge mileage off of these models just from unlocking their ability to do very fundamental linear reasoning alone; most of the rest of what &quot;intelligence&quot; is, is (not completely of course) emergent from that.... tinkering, hacking and honing these models will get us a long way from here on in (I think, as a layman).

 Summed up my thoughts on GPT-4 perfectly. I also feel that the people saying &#39;It&#39;s just a heuristics tool&#39; or a &#39;glorified lookup table&#39; are being way to reductionist. If you just ask it a couple of outside of the box questions and take a minute to reflect on its answers, it&#39;s so patently obvious that while it can be completely wrong at times, it&#39;s clearly doing reasoning of some kind.<br><br>To the people who are saying &quot;it&#39;s just predicting the next word&quot;. Yes it is, but it&#39;s not about at what word it arrives, it&#39;s about the journey that it makes to get to that word.

Let&#39;s call the unknown number x. We can set up an equation:<br><br>7x + 8 * 8 = 106<br><br>First, we can simplify the right side by performing the multiplication on the right:<br><br>7x + 64 = 106<br><br>Next, we can isolate the variable x by subtracting 64 from both sides:<br><br>7x = 42<br><br>Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 7:<br><br>x = 6<br><br>So we need to replace the 4 on the left side with a 6 to make the left side equal to 106:<br><br>7 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 42 + 64 = 106.

Looks like the horn is attached to the .north anchor on the northmost node.
