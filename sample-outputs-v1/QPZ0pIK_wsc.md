Description: 
 There are a lot of opinions on how to hire coders, and most of them are terrible. The opinions, that is, not the coders. But a basic filter test to make sure someone can do what they say they can: that seems reasonable, and FizzBuzz is one of the more common tests. Even now, interviewers use it. Let's talk about why it's tricky, and how to solve it.

 Again, I learned to program in BASIC in 1977. We learned to do simplest of programs was the best. The rounding function was one. I&#39;m still a bit rusty on the code but it was something like (To round to the nearest 0.5) ABS(Nx10+(0.5)/10) where ABS is the absolute value between the parentheses.  That being just the integer value where decimal value is disregarded.

 Instead of building a string, just use a list of pairs. Then you can filter for divisibility and give back the requisite strings, and join those together without spaces. Of course, if the result is empty, return the string version of the number. Apply that to each number and return (or print, if you like).<br><br>```python<br>    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -&gt; List[str]:<br>        def convert(m: int) -&gt; str:<br>            return &quot;&quot;.join([<br>                v for (k,v) in [<br>                    (3, &#39;Fizz&#39;),<br>                    (5, &#39;Buzz&#39;),<br>                ]<br>                if m % k == 0<br>            ]) or str(m)<br><br>        return [convert(m) for m in range(1,n+1)]<br>```

 Set variables for divisible by 3 and 5, then for each number say if x=0 and y=0, x=1 and y=0, etc (where x and y are the divisibility variables) then you just have to set the variables and write a few lines for each situation

 I think the best way would be to make a map e.g.: (3 =&gt; &quot;Fizz&quot;, 5 =&gt; &quot;Buzz&quot;).<br>Its simple and would make it easy to change or add to. For example: Reverse the order so 5 outputs &quot;BuzzFizz&quot; or add new words for other numbers.<br><br>In terms of computations it would be divisors * range if you check every number with every divisor.<br>But you could improve this by doing the divisor checking beforehand.<br>For example if we create a list of strings we can just use steps of 3 and append &quot;Fizz&quot; to the strings, same with steps of 5 and &quot;Buzz&quot;.<br>Of course the list of strings would use more memory (amount depending on the range), so the best performance option is as usual dependent on the amount of memory available.<br>To potentially save some memory we could use divisors * range bits instead of strings, flip the corresponding bits instead of appending the associated characters

 Hmm, that is a typical programmer approach. C.S. student or software designer should look at this as a math problem. Figure out the nature of this and create a algorithm.<br>It is faster to add than divide for a computer. And a forward one-time loop doesn&#39;t repeat its element. My intuition would be start with two variables to store 3 and 5. Once your loop hits them. Increment them by add 3 and 5. That take cares of the Fizz, Buzz. But still need one more piece to take care of the fizzbuzz. When any one of those variables is hit. Also check if they are equal. I didn&#39;t actually implement it. This simple algorithm may not be completely correct. But I would go this direction instead of doing %.

 For max extensibility and abstraction, making an Object FBNumber, storing bool values for all the multiples that you want to check for.  Single argument constructor with the integer, on construction check each multiple, assign all boolean values.  Alternatively, a zero arg constructor with a setNumber function, or a builder if we want to be able to play with how many numbers we&#39;re considering for a single round.  For printing, create a public string method getOutput, which either does the same &quot;build the string after going through each boolean value&quot; logic, or something else like a switch structure.  This way, you can know the FizzBuzz value of any number, you could make a function to change the number at any point in runtime, you could set up functions to change the values of &quot;Fizz&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot; that you actually want to output, and it hides all of that in an abstracted class.

 Not difficult at all. most programming languages have a rounding function of some kind. create a counting function, then nest a function within the counting function to set a local variable equal to the original number, then divide by 3, round up, multiply by 3, and then compare to the original number. If equal, then a=fizz, else a= nil. Run the same loop for dividing by 5, and b = buzz. if a and b = nil then a = number. Lastly print a and b into an output.

 I don&#39;t like too many ifs. If there are this many ifs I would rather use switch. Also code you wrote 5 min in doesn&#39;t need to check for both variables being true. Since function doesn&#39;t return anything but prints, it can print Fizz if %3 == 0 and Buzz if %5 == 0. Since there is no &quot;else if&quot; or &quot;else&quot;, both conditions will apply and output will be FizzBuzz anyway.

 The use of “i” as the index for loops is historical.  In the 1960s and 1970s Fortran was the dominate programming language.  It is the precursor of most languages today.  Fortran used variables that started with i,j,k,l,m and n as default integer variables.  Programmers got into the habit of using these single letter variables as simple integer variables in loops so they did not have to go back and add them to their integer declarations. Over time this became so widely used that everyone started assuming that if they saw these single character variables then they were index variables in loops.  That coding habit moved with the programmer as they moved to new languages.

 I wouldn&#39;t like getting this question, because I would know they want something that can scale with additional requirements, but they&#39;re also specifically asking to play a concrete game of fizzbuzz so there shouldn&#39;t be any need to scale or maintain a slapped-together solution. I&#39;d then spend too long pondering if I should go with a fast/dodgy solution to prove I quickly know what to do, or write a huge amount of boilerplate that may or may not be used in follow up questions, eventually taking too long thinking and having the interviewer developing an ick for me.<br><br>Also a company that cares too much about how your code can change to accommodate huge swings in scope is a bit hypocritical because actually they&#39;re the one&#39;s unable to formulate a strict set of requirements for their product

 Okay, but what if they say that the &quot;Buzz&quot; in &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; should not be capitalized? Also there&#39;s the problem that you want to avoid adding to strings, they are in a lot of languages unmutable and even if not, depending on the interpreter/compiler, it might be possible that you have to reallocate the string because it doesn&#39;t fit in the space you previously reserved for it. Passing a string directly to the print function might also avoid copying it later on when you print the constructed string.<br>Also, constant variables are a concept that is relevant here. You could make 5 or 3, or even &quot;Fizz&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot; a constant variable. Like that you wouldn&#39;t have to change it for each time the variable occurs, just once.<br>The test has of course the problem that programs, or even modules, that are simple don&#39;t have to be designed like a complex module would. If it grows later on, be sure to changed that, but in such a case it would be too much.<br><br>Btw, my, fairly standard (imo), variant:<br><br>for i in range(1, 101):<br>	if i % 5 == 0:<br>		if i % 3 == 0:<br>			print(&quot;fizzbuzz&quot;)<br>		else:<br>			print(&quot;buzz&quot;)<br>	elif i % 3 == 0:<br>		print(&quot;fizz&quot;)<br>	else:<br>		print(i)<br><br><br>Note that the only duplication of values/code is 1) testing i % 3 == 0 twice, and 2) having &quot;fizz&quot; and &quot;buzz&quot; in both the individual versions and their combined version.<br><br>Also, using list comprehension: print(*[(&quot;fizzbuzz&quot; if i % 5 == 0 else &quot;fizz&quot;) if i % 3 == 0 else (&quot;buzz&quot; if i % 5 == 0 else i) for i in range(1, 101) ], sep=&#39;\n&#39;)

 This is incredibly easy. I think it is a little misleading to people even wanting an entry-level position. To say that a comp-sci degree wouldn&#39;t teach you about this is like saying a math degree isn&#39;t going to teach you how to add numbers with a calculator; technically true, but misleading because it is so basic that it is not even taught. Maybe I am only aware of the interview questions at top tech companies, but the questions they ask are going to be an order of magnitude more difficult than this. If you want one of those positions, then coding something like this should take you less than one minute. If you&#39;re a complete beginner, then this is a good question to learn about iteration and the if/else structure.

 Okay so I know very little about programming but what I would do is take every number between 1-100 and divide each by 3 or 5. If there is a remainder then output the dividend. If there isn&#39;t a remainder for either x/3 or x/5 then output Fizz or Buzz respectively, and if both come back with no remainder then output Fizzbuzz. And this would probably work for any set of numbers outside of 1-100. Now all I got to do is jog back my memory of the python course I took 3 years ago.

 This was my result with python, it allows for changing 3 and 5 to alternative numbers, you could also create variables for Fizz, Buzz and Fizz buzz, but being as this is a &quot;Fizz Buzz&quot; game that would not be necessary as these strings are not likely to change.<br><br>answer = &quot;&quot;<br>numA = 3<br>numB = 5<br><br>for i in range (1, 101):<br>    if i % numA == 0 and i % numB == 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Fizz Buzz&quot;)<br>    elif i % numA == 0 and i % numB != 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Fizz&quot;)<br>    elif i % numA != 0 and i % numB == 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Buzz&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        answer = i<br>    print(answer)<br><br>To spice things up and show the maintainability of the code, I did this:<br><br>answer = &quot;&quot;<br>numA = 7<br>numB = 5<br><br>nonMultiples = &quot;&quot;<br><br>for i in range (1, 101):<br>    if i % numA == 0 and i % numB == 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Fizz Buzz&quot;)<br>    elif i % numA == 0 and i % numB != 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Fizz&quot;)<br>    elif i % numA != 0 and i % numB == 0:<br>        answer = (&quot;Buzz&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        answer = i<br>        nonMultiples = nonMultiples + str(i) + &quot; &quot;<br>    print(answer)<br><br>print (&quot;Non multiples of &quot; + str(numA) + &quot; and &quot; + str(numB) + &quot;: &quot; + str(nonMultiples))

 a good way to have expandability is have 2 parameters to the functions (inputs) one with a list (array) of objects each one with the number and outputted word, then have your function create the tests for each of them itself, thatway instead of changing the function you merely change the inputs too it and get the results you want

 My personal preference would probably be to initialise counters for 3&#39;s and 5&#39;s before the loop, increment them in the loop, and everytime each one hits the desired number reset them and add to a string similar to Tom&#39;s answer. Possibly less elegant than a modulo operator, but it is just a straight numerical comparison which might compile to something a touch quicker to execute.

 Good video however your final code has a major flaw. Namely that you are adding to the string, strings are immutable so every time you add to them they have to be destroyed and re-created. While this isn&#39;t a major problem for the code you have there (as you are going to be destroying and re-creating the string twice at most) it would get really inefficient really quickly if you started adding more checks. You would be much better off creating a list of strings and then using whatever javascript&#39;s equivalent of the .join() method is (apologies I am not a javascript programmer). <br><br>I would also argue something like programming a sudoku solver would be a much better question, as it achieves the same goals but requires a much greater degree of competence with the language while having the additional benefit of showing how good the programmer is at writing efficient code (as this is a problem for which the good solutions are orders of magnitude faster than the bad ones)

 Well if the idea is to just make the code easier to edit for checking different set of 2 numbers, I&#39;d probably just set 2 constants.<br><br>if the idea is for the code to work for an arbitrary amount of numbers, an elegant way  might be to have 2 constant arrays, one include all the numbers to check, the other has all the corresponding word to print out. In each iteration of the for loop, check through the everything in the number array, and just print all the corresponding words. I only know c and c++, which let you choose when to change line, so that’s not a problem.

 I&#39;d do all evaluations immediately and save the results as variables called fizz and buzz. Then it&#39;s as easy as evaluating those, which will then result in an easier to read code, and you can also assign the output text to a variable further simplifying the code and only using a single &quot;return&quot;.

 I dealt with the repetition problem slightly differently.

Then let it check if the number is dividable by 3 and 5 and set the corresponding variable to true.<br><br>After that make an &quot;if both are true output Fizzbuzz, else if fizz is true output that, else if buzz is true output that, else output the number.&quot;<br><br>Changing 3 and 5 would be easy as the number is only shown once in the division check. However, as soon as you want to add a third or fourth number I guess the if/else thing for the output gets way too complicated.<br><br>Anyways, I still like my solution.

I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a bit longer, it makes my for loop look nicer.<br><br>def FizzBuzz(n):<br>	if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:<br>		return True<br>	else:<br>		return False<br>def Fizz(n):<br>	if n % 3 == 0:<br>		return True<br>	else:<br>		return False<br>def Buzz(n):<br>	if n % 5 == 0:<br>		return True<br>	else:<br>		return False<br><br>for n in range(1,101):<br>	if FizzBuzz(n) == True:<br>		print(&#39;FizzBuzz&#39;)<br>	elif Fizz(n) == True:<br>		print(&#39;Fizz&#39;)<br>	elif Buzz(n) == True:<br>		print(&#39;Buzz&#39;)<br>	else:<br>		print(n)

 I did the challenge in probably the worst way possible. Instead of dividing and remainders I just counted every x, if x = this send a value to here. Then just run that through another bit of code to find the answer. Works just as well, and I can change values easily. As long as it starts at one.

 I feel like this depends on what they mean by &quot;play&quot; like to play fizzbuzz requires two entities that send data and compute that data to get an output to send back? So two programs required or lest one program and a person??? but if all they want is a program capable of replicating the out put of a 100% optimal game of fizzbuzz.... then like... just get a list of the correct outputs in the correct order and make the program print them to console???

 I worked as a junior control systems engineer for about 2 years, they were looking for an experienced engineer but gave me an interview anyway just in case.<br>They asked me to program a PLC to run a traffic light system. Very simple I know, but the reason I got the job was because I decided to do a 4-way traffic light system with pedestrian crossing “buttons” (all virtual) and I could show them my program iterations. I showed them where I went wrong and what I did the improve my coding.

 Oh, right.    Bottles Caps &amp; Labels.   (Never heard of fizz-buzz).   A drinking game for a group of people, who count in turn.   Ends in 3 or divisible by 3, say &#39;Bottles&#39; and the direction of the count reverses.   5, &#39;caps&#39;, 7, &#39;labels&#39;.   3 takes priority over 5 over 7.     You make a mistake, you drink.  <br>The count rarely exceeds 20 before it dissolves in disorder.

 I didn&#39;t come across this childrens&#39; game until my mid-twenties in the late-eighties!  I met it as a drinking game (miss a fizz or buzz, 1 shot each).  It was a circle game with more than two players, each fizz or buzz reversed direction (not noticing the direction change incurred a penalty too,)  Fizz was defined as &quot;3, a multiple of three, or a number containing the digit 3&quot;, likewise for buzz and 5.  Code that!  (More importantly, specify the problem exactly before asking for an off-the-cuff solution)

 i is used for the loopvariable because often you would iterate over an array, and then i would be the index of the current array element. This is also the reason why these loops usually start at 1 = 0 and end at i &lt; NumberOfElementsInArray

 This last solution assumes that there is a semantic dependency between the rules.

 My strategy had been not too far off, I had started with a variable that contained the number value, then changed it to an empty string if either condition was true before appending Fizz and Buzz to the string. I see now that it&#39;s probably a good idea to test based off the empty string condition, as it gives more modularity and expandability to the program.

 ... so not sure if someone has posted this yet... but the variable <i>i</i> is short for &quot;index&quot; and most coders back in the day were trying to type as short a code as possible and actually really back in the day typing less characters was actually beneficial for mostly space reasons. So that is where it came from. These days at least in most cooperative environments where maintainability by other people than the author is really important following that tenet is not beneficial. Most people try to follow some variation of the &quot;clean code&quot; ideas. But I guess there are still environments, even cooperate ones where writing as short as possible code is beneficial still, like embedded systems. Outside of those I would recommend not to use &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; etc. ... and I like you named the variable <i>output</i> as you did (and not &quot;o&quot;).

 as someone who&#39;s only real practical background with coding was being told to do some python coding without actually having been taught python by a full professor while i was in undergrad (as a chemistry major at the time), a lot of my reaction to this was a long the lines of &quot;i never would&#39;ve thought to do it like that&quot;

 Tried this in C++, went with a modular but super front-loaded solution by declaring two arrays with the divisible numbers to use and the strings to look for, then used pointer arithmetic to auto-calculate the length of the arrays in a nested loop that runs thru both arrays to check the counter of the bigger loop. Sightly unwieldy and I probably didn&#39;t explain it well, but it worked okay!

 I didn&#39;t learn this game until college, where it was a drinking game with a bunch of people in a circle.  The numbers were 5 (&quot;Fizz&quot;) and 7 (&quot;Buzz&quot;) and the additional rules were not merely if it were a multiple of 5/7 but also if it contained 5/7.  Thus, 17 is &quot;Buzz&quot; because it has a 7 in it.  Plus, except for 5 and 7, you needed to do both.  Thus, 15 is &quot;FizzFizz&quot; because it is divisible by 5 and has a 5 in it.  At most, you use only two descriptors with &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; having priority.  Thus, 55 is simply &quot;FizzFizz&quot; rather than &quot;FizzFizzFizz&quot; because you only do two and 35 is &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; rather than &quot;FizzFizzBuzz&quot; because you not only do only two but also &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; takes priority over &quot;FizzFizz.&quot;<br><br>1, 2, 3, 4, Fizz, 6, Buzz, 8, 9, Fizz, 11, 12, 13, Buzz, FizzFizz, 16, Buzz, 18, 19, Fizz, Buzz, 22, 23, 24, FizzFizz, 26, Buzz, Buzz...

 The origin of using i as a counter in for loops is the word &#39;index&#39;, which is what you normally use it like. The next letters in the &quot;tradition&quot; are j and k, which are just the next letters after i in the english alphabet. After that, there is no specific common pattern, and you also may need to think why you are using so many nested loops 😂

791: Chris Mitchell 
 I haven&#39;t read all 6000 comments, so I&#39;m sure someone has already mentioned this - but in the dim and distant past, FORTRAN had a primitive typing rule: variables were real, except for those beginning with the letters I to N. So COUNT would be a real number, but KOUNT would be an integer. For simple variable like indices, it was easier (and fewer keystrokes when you&#39;re making punched cards or a paper tape) to use a single letter. Thus the convention became &quot;use I, J, K, ,and so on for counters&quot;. I and N were particularly popular as many programmers came from a maths background, where I (actually a rather fancy I with a double vertical stroke) was the set of integers, and N (fancy N) the set of natural numbers. K was popular among non-mathematicians for counters (probably because of the &quot;K&quot; sound in &quot;count&quot;) and often used in BASIC.

 Nice solution, but concatenating strings is slightly slower than checking remainders. Nobody really cares, but since it&#39;s a coding interview, better to use a more optimized solution. Instead of concatenating strings just print them but don&#39;t switch to a new line until you&#39;re done with the current one, that&#39;s it.

 From what I&#39;ve heard anecdotally, the &quot;otherwise, print the number&quot; is the part that new programmers often leave out. The problem isn&#39;t presented in as nearly much detail as it is in the video, and the developers get so caught up in the Fizz/Buzz/FizzBuzz thing that they forget the last part. It&#39;s not only a programming question, it&#39;s an &quot;attention to detail&quot; question.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&amp;t=2m50s">2:50</a> the letter &quot;i&quot; stands for &quot;index&quot; because, in traditional for-loops like this one, you use it to go through an array of values where &quot;i&quot; is the index of the value you want to access the the array. It&#39;s shorter and easier to read &quot;myArray[i]&quot; than &quot;myArray[index]&quot;. Single-character variable names are usually frowned upon but for-loops like these are an exception.<br><br>Additionally, it fits the math conventions quite nicely. When working with matrices, a mathematician usually uses letters &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; to describe the columns and rows of a matrix or tensor. I think it&#39;s for the same reason, &quot;i&quot; stands for &quot;index&quot; in math too.

 Here&#39;s a fun little method you could use with bit manipulation. I didn&#39;t benchmark it but how optimal it is depends on if the compiler is using a tableswitch or a lookupswitch, preferably a tableswitch<br><br>switch( (i%3 == 0) + ((i%5 == 0) &lt;&lt; 1) )<br>case 0b01:<br>//Print out Fizz<br>case 0b10:<br>//Print out Buzz<br>case 0b11:<br>//Print Out FizzBuzz<br>default:<br>//Print Out i<br><br>If it&#39;s a tableswitch then the time complexity for finding the case is O(1)<br>But if it&#39;s a lookupswitch then it&#39;s about the same as if you used a if, else if, else statement

 I&#39;ve been learning C++ for just under a month and decided to take this on as soon as I learned about for loops. I managed to figure it out using those nested if-else statements, and I&#39;m absolutely thrilled that I was even able to get it to work. I see now that my code is dodgy, but that&#39;s okay! My goal was for it to work, and that was hard enough. I hope in time I learn to think ahead and code clean, but for now I will take the win :) 

 	Replies: ['Flaxelaxen', '@Kevin Wong C++ is not at all a waste of time. It&#39;s still heavily used as a systems language and performance critical applications.

Of course, sometimes being in that situation to begin with can be sign of smelly code, atleast it solves the problem in a fairly readable way. To explain what i mean with guard statement, rather than check to see if a statement is true, which then runs another if statement inside it etc, you instead check if the statement is not true.

 As typically stated, the problem is deliberately underspecified.  Rather than immediately trying to code a solution, the developer should ask whether the solution is to be optimized for time, for space, for readability, for maintainability, for testability, for generality (ranges other than 1 to 100, divisors other than 3 and 5, and more than two divisors).  These characteristics can be conflicting, and different prioritization of the objectives will necessarily lead to different solutions.  For example, if run time is of the essence and the parameters won&#39;t change (1, 100, 3, 5), then simply code a single print statement with a multiline string literal as the argument, and you&#39;re done.

 there is one more approach instead of using modulo operator use count to 3 and count to 5 and then reset it. so the complexity of your code decreases.

 For infinitely expandable sequence of number and their corresponding string and to output the combination of all truthful items for each term, you want two arrays. One with the numbers, the other with the strings.<br>You append output as you do in your last iteration, but do so inside a loop that go through the length of the array. If any evaluation on the numerical array returns true, append.<br>In fact, I&#39;d make it a function that intakes the two arrays, which the invoker can specify in any way it wishes. Be it fixed, as is the examples, or variable via an input script.<br><br>static void superFizzBuzz(List&lt;int&gt; numbers, List&lt;String&gt; terms, int start, int limit) {<br>  for (int i=start; i&lt;limit; i++) {<br>    String output = &quot;&quot;;<br>    for (int j=0; j&lt;numbers.size(); j++) { //I think this can also be &quot;for (int j : numbers)&quot; but... I have never done that for primitive type arrays, only object arrays so... I&#39;m not sure.<br>      if (i%numbers[j] == 0) {<br>        output += terms[j];<br>      }<br>    }<br>    if (output.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {<br>      output += i;<br>    }<br>    System.out.println(output);<br>  }<br>} <br><br>The best coding practice, however, is to <b>not</b> bake in expandability unless you <b>know</b> that it can exist. Because you end up with unnecessarily complicated code with unused features that makes it harder to understand and maintain by someone else. For example, anyone seeing the above program would not realize that it&#39;s for fizzbuzz immediately(leaving aside the name of the function anyhow). So the best programmer, upon hearing the task, is the one that asks the interviewer if there is likely to be any future modification or expandability and what they are if there is any and code accordingly. In fact, had the number range be small enough, say 30 or less, it might actually be advantageous to hard code the prints, it could be potentially be less resource intensive to run(not to say that this is a particularly difficult program to run but....)

 Heh in c/c++ when outputting to the console you dont get newlines unless you put \n or endl so you could just have 2 variables for fizz and buzz and just do what you did originally with the I %3 and I % 5 but set the fizz or buzz to 1 in the if statement then at the bottom you could check to see if either fizz or buzz are 1 and if not print the number, then print a newline to go to the next line, ez, now whether or not that&#39;s the BEST way to do is I dont know :P

 my way to solve this would be to divide the input (in this case 100) by 15, floor it for the loop, do everything inbetween this steps &quot;manually&quot; (or in two steps of five and one extra step, not sure about this, but i dont want to have too many variables just for a simple task like that) and for the rest have some spaghetti code at the end bc it should have a good performance (doesn&#39;t matter in this case but i always try to make my code  as efficient to execute as possible) and there&#39;s input.<br>(btw im not a good developer, feel free to criticize me)<br><br>EDIT:<br>So the problem with changing the fives to seven is harder in my code as well. in my defense, i just coded it to be able to play the game. since the rules don&#39;t state how long the game should go decided to rather make the length variable than something which is stated in the rules

 This just popped up in my recommended, so apologies for such a late comment! I&#39;ve always been under the impression that &#39;i&#39; was used simply because you&#39;re representing an integer. It&#39;s an easy way to look at test code and go &#39;right so that bit is an integer and this is happening to it&#39;. That&#39;s how it was explained to me when being taught various programming concepts and good practice. In anything more complex than that, it&#39;s very unlikely that your program is going to be working with a single variable (let alone a single integer), so that&#39;s when you start giving meaningful names. Like &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;bum&#39;, &#39;fsfsfdf&#39; and &#39;bums&#39;.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&amp;t=6m15s">6:15</a> What I&#39;ve learned from years of programming in the private sector is that there are trade-offs between doing what the shareholder&#39;s request and programming to handle for the unknowns and what-ifs. The problem is that sometimes I work on projects where there&#39;s not enough time to future-proof code. I am left to do the work precisely as requested. If the time comes later to expand the code, then a scoping meeting is assembled, and we look at that then.

Likewise, variable x and y typically appear for key-value pairs or some other pairing. Variable x, by itself, becomes a catch-all placeholder, an unknown that we use as a bucket to put values in. X and y are also used for grid math, and z when we&#39;re working with 3D vectors. Variables like k, l, a, b tend to be one-offs that serve a quick purpose within the private scope of a given function, loop, or another encapsulation. You may also see them in obfuscated code where a utility has converted all the uniquely named code into something illegible. When I write code, I like to use i, x, y, z, k, l, a, and b. Beyond that, I like using names that make sense to me as often as possible. Too many single-letter variables can make code unruly and hard to read. 

 	Replies: ['kxmode', '\u200b@Jesse Brown I know this. I provided background information for why programmers continue to use specific single-letter variables in some code areas. &quot;i&quot; in a loop is almost always going to mean &quot;iterator&quot; as an example. It&#39;s akin to the icons in many programs, like the &quot;scissor&quot; in Photoshop representing &quot;cut&quot; harkens back to the process where graphic designers would quite literally cut their design on paper.', 'Jesse Brown', 'Any single letter variable is an arbitrary designation that really has no meaning other than how it is used in context.']

 Javascript example. Initially it took me about 15 minutes. But then you said up to a hundred, so it took another couple of minutes to change if (i === 15) { output = &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;; } to if (i % 3 === 0 &amp;&amp; i % 5 === 0) { output = &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;; } . I added a max variable to make it spicy.

 For anyone wondering on how to easily implement extra numbers, you can make an array of objects. Each object will contain two things, the factor( ex- 3, 5) and the string that needs to be appended( ex- &quot;Fizz&quot;, &quot;Buzz&quot;). Inside the for loop, create another loop, with variable j. Check if(i % array[ j ].factor == 0){ output += array[ j ].str }<br>Simple as that

 A fact of such questions that I also like is that it isn&#39;t heavily dependent on knowing specific areas of language syntax by memory, especially when the expectation is to write the solution without access to reference materials. I&#39;ve had a few interviews that ran into that, like write a duplicate file detection routine in a 45 minute live coding session. I was doing so with Python but my background was using that language with Ansible so I had limited existing knowledge of the os and hasher libraries at the time (I later wrote the routine on my own after the interview to figure out how to do it.)

 Best explanation for i, j, and k in for loops I know:<br>i, j, and k are the names of the 3-D unit vectors, which are orthogonal, much like the variables in loops are often.<br>These in turn come from the four quaternions:  1, i, j, k.<br>The latst two are so named because the names for the complex units are 1, i.<br>Carl Friedrich Gauss was a well-documented proponent of using &quot;i&quot; for sqrt(-1), but it&#39;s possible Leonhard Euler did so as well.  That&#39;s probably easy to check, since Euler was such a prodigious author.<br>And it&#39;s possible that the i comes from René Descartes&#39; derogation of complex numbers:<br>“For the rest, neither the false nor the true roots are always real, sometimes they are only imaginary, that is to say one may imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity corresponding to those one imagines.”

 I started learning python and you bet I tried my hand at fizzbuzz, trying to code as cleanly and flexible as possible:<br><br>numb = int(input(&#39;Play fizzbuzz up to: \n&#39;))<br><br>n1 = (3,5)<br>m1 = (&#39;fizz&#39;,&#39;buzz&#39;)<br><br>i = 1<br><br>while i&lt;=numb:<br>    j = 0<br>    lista = &#39;&#39;<br>    for j in range(len(n1)):<br>        if i % int(n1[j]) == 0:<br>            lista += m1[j]<br>    if lista == &#39;&#39;:<br>        print(i)<br>    else:<br>        print(lista.title())<br>    i += 1<br><br>it works and i can add new numbers and words by just editing the tuples, no need to write new code.<br>God I hope i get the fizzbuzz at a coding interview.

 I&#39;ve always thought of i as in &quot;i&quot;nteger, which is normally what you use for a for-loop, if it is a nestled for-loop, each step i just increment alphabetically. So the next layer is j, next is k, etc. Personally, i&#39;m always using int for for-loops, if i use any other expression than an incremental or decremental by whole numbers, i use a while-loop instead.

 It&#39;s over 2 years later but I do happen to know what the person that taught me programming learned for why i is used in a loop. It is the index of the loop, or the place in the loop you are, and i is just the shortened way of typing, and programmers are lazy.

 Wait, I think I get it. To fix your final code, you need to write all numbers and strings into a two-dimensional array:<br> [[3, &#39;Fizz&#39;]<br>[5, &#39;Buzz&#39;]] <br>etc. Then, you run the checking code (single line) where numbers and strings are pulled from the array, and you run it in a loop once per every line of the array. Am I correct and this is the solution?

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&amp;t=1m49s">1:49</a> If the correct replacement for multiples of 15 were something unrelated to Fizz and Buzz then nothing short of taking all 4 cases separately -- as you describe -- would do. But for those numbers you say FizzBuzz, which suggests an altermative approach of if(i%3 == 0) printf(&quot;Fizz&quot;); if(i%5 == 0) printf(&quot;Buzz&quot;); -- except for the inconvenient fact that you must characterise the numbers which aren&#39;t multiples of either...<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a> Your chosen language&#39;s way to output some text implicitly outputs a line-terminator?

But I&#39;m an Android Developer, my interviews should check my Android expertise, not whether I can solve FizzBuzz on a white board.

 from TimDay on StackOverflow: &quot;Mathematicians were using i,j,k to designate integers in algebra (subscripts, series, summations etc) long before (e.g 1836 or 1816) computers were around (this is the origin of the FORTRAN variable type defaults).  The habit of using letters from the end of the alphabet (...,x,y,z) for unknown variables and from the beginning (a,b,c...) for constants is generally attributed to Rene Descartes, (see also here) so I assume i,j,k...n (in the middle of the alphabet) for integers is likely due to him too.&quot;<br>There you go.

So i, j, &amp; k were &#39;naturals&#39; for use as loop counters.  This was back in the day before there were actual loop instructions.   No &quot;Do&quot; or &quot;For ... Next&quot; loop commands existed.  You had to write your own loops; and i, j, &amp; k became quite commonly used for 3 nested loops.<br>  For me at least, &quot;i&quot; just naturally carried over to the next generations of languages.  So, &quot;Tradition&quot;?  Yes.

 I don’t get it: if i is a multiple of 3, say i = 12, divide it by 3, the outcome is 4. Not 0 therefore. In fact, even 3 divided by 3 is not 0. So what does that mean? Apparently i % 3 == 0 is something else then what is said. There is something really incrowdy here overlooked to explain. That’s where programmers and users differ greatly and why so many programmes and manuals fail to explain properly. Funny to watch. 

 	Replies: ['Glenn Castillo', 'modulo operator gets the remainder when you divide a number without getting the exact quotient (like with the floating numbers) for example dividing 12 by 3 is 4 without any remainder, which makes 12 % 3 = 0, another is if you divide 16 by 5, which would be (3 remainder 1), then 16 % 5 = 1, in modulo the result was always the remainder which makes his explanation in the beginning a lot of sense if you study how modulo works :)']

 So I know it&#39;s been 3 years and you&#39;ll probably never see this,  but I just wanted you to know that this video inspired me to start coding again. I&#39;m a very, very beginner programmer. I learned a tiny bit of JavaScript from Khan Academy a few years ago. I saw this video and went &quot;HEY, WAIT! I could do that!&quot; and then I paused the video and I went to Khan academy&#39;s program editor. Albeit using the println command because I can&#39;t use console.log there, I wrote your second actually successful program (the one with the else statements), exactly, line for line. And of course, as you said, it was still dodgy, but coming back to the video and seeing it listed as the slightly better solution than the worst one was invigorating. I wrote this! I made it work! and I didn&#39;t do it in the worst way either! Then, immediately, you gave me steps and strategies to improve, so now I&#39;m inspired to continue. Thank you for making this video!

 The &quot;i&quot; is used in most programming languages because i is an abbreviation of an index. But we don&#39;t want to put everywhere in our code index. ever time you need the index in the block of code we just use i. Also since its declared and a loop should not have a lot of code.

 The traditional loop variables &#39;i&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, &#39;k&#39; are used because theyre imaginary numbers for 3D coordinate systems. When loops have multiple layers of depth, their multidimensional, so you use the variable &#39;j&#39; for the y axis, &#39;k&#39; for the third and l for the fourth.

 People use i for counters because in mathematics and especially sets we talk about “for any integer, i,” sometimes in reference to a range of sequential values for i. We use j and k (and sometimes more letters depending on depth) for nested loop counters because those are the letters after i. But I have always deviated from that tradition because there sometimes are i, j, or k in the spelling of more meaningful variables and values, like a boolean valued “inside,” a container object “jar,” or a text string “What’s the frequency, Kenneth.” Searching code for the counter variables is tedious if they are just single letters so almost immediately I started using double letters, ii, jj, and kk because they are easy both to spot and to search for.<br><br>Incidentally, if one has loops nested deeply enough to need even three counter variables and a data set of any significant size, reconsider the algorithm because it’s looking like O(n**3).

 There&#39;s only really two obvious ways. Because it loops after 15 turns I think the most defensible way is a 15 element LUT. It can be written in a few minutes so it reduces the development time to a minimum.<br><br>The other obvious way is to have two variables decrementing and sending a message when they reach 0 and starting again. This takes advantage of potential register optimisation.<br><br>After that it&#39;s just test a number mod 3 then mod 7. <br><br>Personally, I&#39;m not mad about the mod methods this guy uses, mod usually hides a division and that&#39;s nasty. One countdown register per thing is much faster especially on computers with low CPU power. <br><br>Other than that though, I think this is too easy to be a good interview question. It&#39;s easily solved and there aren&#39;t many good ways of doing it.

 If you are using python, you should use list to build the input and then use join() to concatenate in any style. It is more flexible and efficient than direct string concatenation. Of course, if there are too many conditions, you it may be better to build a lookup table using dict.

Im just very confused because tom said it is something you dont learn in computer science class. what else do you learn?

 Huh, 2 years late to the party and no one has mentioned why &quot;i&quot; is traditionally used in loops.<br><br><br>Incrementor. The thing you increment. <br><br><br>But now that we&#39;ve chosen &quot;i&quot; as our starting incrementor, we can use &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;&#39;l&quot; for internal loops, though if you&#39;re getting to 4 nested loops in the same function it&#39;s probably time to spin off a new function. But in that way i,j,k... becomes our chosen incrimentors just like x,y and z became our chosen variables for dimenions.

 Or you could just store the results of two conditions and then run the resulting variable through a truth table.<br>Anyway, this challenge reminds me a math trick for checking if something is evenly divisible by 3: you sum an integer&#39;s individual numbers (recursively if needed) until you get to either 3/6/9 or something else. The property of even divisibility by 3 persists inherently. Works in a similar way for 9.<br>Probably won&#39;t fly as an optimization to a program, since I&#39;m sure these trivial tasks are already optimized deep down on the lowest of levels. That mnemonic-like algorithm is tailored to human mind&#39;s strengths and weaknesses.

 i stands for index, index comes from array, most of the time, any kind of loop is used to access an array by it&#39;s index incrementally. I think that&#39;s where programmer are used to declare i as a variable in for loop

 ^for me as a german, this is so weird. If you want to be a software dev, you get a degree in software dev. Skills you prove in your resume. the interview is 80% about your personality and wheather you fit into the company/team. Skills only get tested in rare occasion, because this is already done by someone else (university, etc.) and if you lied about your skills, you can still get fired immediatly (with reason) in your trial time (most of the times 3 months)

 Great video, Scott! I made an array with objects with 2 properties, .name and .value. Inside my main FOR loop is a second FOR loop that iterates through the array, checking the .value against the current i, and if it&#39;s % = 0, concatenate the .name. This way all you have to do to expand the program is add in another object to the array with the value you&#39;d like to check, and the name you&#39;d like to output.

 <b>Not my information, ripped from StackOverflow</b><br>Mathematicians were using i,j,k to designate integers in algebra (subscripts, series, summations etc) long before (e.g 1836 or 1816) computers were around (this is the origin of the FORTRAN variable type defaults). The habit of using letters from the end of the alphabet (...,x,y,z) for unknown variables and from the beginning (a,b,c...) for constants is generally attributed to Rene Descartes, (see also here) so I assume i,j,k...n (in the middle of the alphabet) for integers is likely due to him too.

 If I&#39;m interviewing you and I tell you to write the FizzBuzz program and you go to a lot of trouble to make it easy to modify, you won&#39;t gain any points.  Not with me anyway.  I might ask you what sort of thing you would do to change one of the numbers, or to add other numbers, but unless I tell you that the program is going to eventually need to replace the multiples of lots of different primes with words, I&#39;d be looking for the simplest solution you can think of, even if it&#39;s a little more difficult to modify.  That&#39;s because even though modifications might be necessary, we have no requirement to make it more complicated right now.  Future-proofing this program, which obviously has no future, is entirely wasted effort.<br><br><br>The advice that is given is to write the program you&#39;re asked to write, not the one that you might need to write in the future.  The problem with that advice is that sometimes planning for the simplest solution tends to paint the developer into a corner.  For a simple program, it&#39;s easy to write a simple linear function with global variables and significant constants defined as  you go, but as programs get more complex, that becomes less workable and, for example, when (not if!) you get tired of recompiling every time some constant changes and want to make the program configurable, you&#39;ll need to do some redesign.  If it seems likely that a program will need to be extended in the future, a wise programmer does quick and easy things in the initial version to make that future program less work.<br><br><br>There is a balance to be struck between not doing any more design than absolutely necessary and building a whole bunch of extraneous crap that nobody will ever need.  In general, there are different approaches for problems of different complexity, and it is better to overestimate the complexity of the final program than to underestimate it, but the ideal situation is to use an approach that is appropriate for precisely the level of complexity of the final program.  It&#39;s just too bad that nobody knows how complex any program will eventually wind up being until is so far along that it&#39;s hard to fix. 

 	Replies: ['Jonathan Guthrie', '@AllUpOns Saying &quot;KISS&quot; misses my larger point.  An awful lot of programming is dealing with different aspects of an incredibly complicated universe.  The goal is for your design to be appropriate for the complexity of the actual problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  If you write a simple solution, I&#39;m going to ask you what approaches you might take to solve a more complicated problem, with the expectation that you would show me stuff like what Mr. Scott does.  You shouldn&#39;t assume that any problem is complicated, but you can&#39;t really assume that it&#39;s not, either.

 Just saw this video years after it was posted. Fascinating. But I totally disagree with the premise of the interview question. When I interview potential employees, I tell them what I expect and see if they can do it. No secret evaluation criteria. There are times I want a job done fast and efficiently. I don&#39;t care how it is done, just get it done now so we can move on. This interview assignment is a children&#39;s game. The rules won&#39;t change in the future. Get it done fastest and get on to the next task. On the other hand, if I want something done that needs to be open to dynamic adjustment in the future, I should say so. While it sounds very clever to say that all programming should be done in a way that allows a programmer in five years to do something with it, there are lots of situations where the code is never likely to be revisited, so don&#39;t invest in a very low probability future outcome. Sure, if it&#39;s all the same in time and effort, make it more dynamic. Sure, you should always do work in a way where other employees can easily see what you did. In practice, though, you need to balance resource use (particularly time) with these goals. If you want the interviewee to show a particular ability, then tell them what it is. It let&#39;s you evaluate them more effectively and sends a clear message about what will be expected in the job.

 Why not just ask for input list from user req int. Then place a single if statement for an exit of done or complete. Then you can use an all() statement (for python and all() might not be the exact syntax for your language) to check each &#39;i&#39; against each list item. Then it doesn&#39;t matter how many numbers they add to the project or how large the range is. Your fizzbuzz will change based on your users demands prior to more demands being added.

 i stands for a bunch of stuff but the reason why it&#39;s stuck around is that back in FORTRAN all variables are considered real numbers by default, except i, j, k, l, m, n default to integers when the type is undeclared. That&#39;s why all those are often used for loop counters and other integerial things.... the reason why they are considered real numbers in FORTRAN is that they are traditionally used in math and engineering for representing integer types.

 I remember being told by a friend of having an exercise in college where they are asked to write the dodgiest code, no notes, that they could for some simple task. Any task they wanted.

 best approach to this problem:<br>Create a config parameter that links divisers to their expected output (could be a simple hashmap or a dictionnary)<br><br>Create a fizzbuzz object that takes as attribute a config parameter.<br>Create a fizzbuzz method taking as parameter an input and gives the given output. (a for loop on each element in config that returns output if input%%element==0 and returns input if no output matches.)<br><br>Then instanciate a fizzbuzz object with the given parameter and loop from 1 to 100 calling the fizzbuzz method.

 I really hope that all the people in the comment who say that &quot;i stands for [word beginning with &#39;i&#39;] understand that &#39;i&#39; does not intrinsically stand for anything (well there may have been some type issue with i back in the bad old days of Fortran, but we&#39;re way past that now). &#39;i&#39; stands for whatever you want it to; it&#39;s just an entry in a symbol table like any other identifier.

 I really like your own and last solution there. Very convenient, short and efficient.<br>But personally as a software delevoper I value performance a lot.<br>You got 3 if-statements that each have to be computed.<br>If you write something like this in Java (I know C or C++ would be even faster):<br><br>public static void main(String args[]) {<br>   for(int i=1; i&lt;101; i++) {<br>      if(i%3==0) {<br>         System.out.println(&quot;Fizz&quot;);<br>         if(i%5==0) {<br>            System.out.print(&quot;Buzz&quot;);<br>         }<br>      } elseif(i%5==0) {<br>         System.out.println(&quot;Buzz&quot;);<br>      } else {<br>         System.out.println(i);<br>      }<br>   }<br>}<br><br>You often only have a single if-statement (2 at most) to compute, which saves quite a bit of time. I know the code looks a bit more ugly and I got redundant code in there but it saves valuable milliseconds.

 The string builder approach is clever, which half the time is a red flag.<br>It&#39;s also not semantic, in particular you are writing fizzbuzz in two separate actions and storing information in the emptiness of the string.<br>The extensibility is also superficial, there&#39;s no reason to assume that the next change will be adding an additional word that follows similar rules.<br>Finally, the performance is suboptimal due to concatenation instead of returning references to static strings.

 i has been used as a variable for sums and other loop-type things in mathematics for centuries. I imagine that&#39;s where programmers get it from. It&#39;s to do with how we are saying that i is a member of some indexing set.

 i stands for integer. Years ago in C you lacked any IDE so you&#39;d have to write variable names using a pseudo naming convention. It was often law in blue chip companies.. EG: iCat (means integer of cat) or szCat (was a string of Cat ) this was ISO9001 compliant code review essential. Just saying Cat wasn&#39;t allowed. The shortest way to write i to pass review as an integer, would be i

 Hi Tom,<br>you sometimes make realy good videos, but I am afraid to say, that this one is not part of those. :-(<br><br>1) Please, don&#39;t use any Java related languages. They are very slow and extremly painful to programm with. Maybe some people understand Java better than non-object-oriented languages, but I am deffinetly not part of these. This is just a statement. This is a big &quot;mistake&quot; made by many people. Don&#39;t take it personaly.<br><br>2) Your attempts to solve this problem: horribly (as I see it). But as you say:&quot;[I] bodge something together and fix some small problems to make it work&quot; (about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a>; hope I got it right).<br>As I see this problem, it is much easier, than you (and many other people) try to solve it. Also: I am not sure if you didn&#39;t tell the following on purpose, but it does not look like that.<br><br>So here is, how I would solve it, with some unnecessary details: Actually, I am not a developer, who programs, I am designing processors. And because of that, I know, that dividing or &quot;make the modulo&quot;, are normaly expensive to compute on normal machines. Esspecialy for high numbers. So instead of dividing, set up a counter, that will output Fizz or/and Buzz to &quot;the console&quot;, when it reaches a speciffic number and than resets it. Adding is much simpler.<br><br>I am writing this in here, because I could not find any other comments on this. <br><br>Thank you for your time :-)

 - This kind of duplication is not a problem. Code needs to be maintainable and this is. Duplication becomes a problem when it is spread out.<br>- You might go for a TDD approach. Go for a function fizzBuzz(var i) that returns the output an write tests for 1, 3, 5 and 15. Then write one test of 1 to 100.

 There is another great and simple problem which I guess most programmers had to deal with at least once:<br>Write a method or function that tests if 2 intervals overlap.<br><br>The untold goal here is to use as few comparisons as possible. Now when you start to think about the problem you might come up with up to 4 different scenarios to catch and create a test for each of them. You may end up with as much as 16 comparisons. However when start to simplify the cases you can end up with only 2 comparisons.

 There are other methods than what you mentioned, but the second one using if/else was what I would&#39;ve done by instinct. The biggest reason I would do this instead of your proposed solution is string concatenation is expensive (take a class in C and learn what strings actually are and you&#39;ll understand why) so unless your language has a StringBuilder (IDK about JavaScript, but Java has one, I think C++ might, and I know C# has one) you are getting computationally expensive as you add more multiples.<br><br><br>Also, just because I&#39;m thinking about it, you could use a string builder and a set of arrays (one for multiples, one for string replacements) as well as a boolean variable to create a nested for loop allowing a near infinite expansion of this code. Would make life nice and simple.<br><br><br>Finally, the changing 5s to 7s thing, is the exact reason they teach global constant variables as a concept, because you only have to update one place in this exact situation. Quite useful!<br><br><br>Very good video, much appreciated!

 The solution with the if-elseif-else is not a bad solution. You only make it seem that way since you hypothethized a future requirment of &quot;what if instead of multiples of 5, I want multiples of 7?&quot; The solution of concatenating strings to an output string works well in that case. But what if I had a future requirement of instead of outputting &quot;FIzzBuzz&quot; on multiples of 3 and 5, I want to output something else like &quot;StopGap&quot;. Well, then the if-elseif-else solution would be much better starting point in that case.

 Two reasons for &quot;i&quot;:<br>1. Its a shorten way to say index or item, and for loops are a lot of times  for looping in array or range.<br>2. In mathematics i,j,k are matrix indexrs for 3 Dimensions, if you have a matrix in N Dimensions where N &gt;3 you start using a(i) numbers where i=0 to N. And matrix are the main use for FOR loops (array and range are matrix in N Dimensions where N = 1).<br><br>Maybe now it will make some sense.

 &quot;I don&#39;t know why we use &#39;i&#39; actually...&quot; --&gt; As most conventions arise historically, I&#39;m going to blame assembly. 8086 has two registers (SI and DI) that are often used to indirectly address (by adding one or the other to a base address) portions of the code&#39;s data. You&#39;d increment (or decrement) and test on them much like we do on i nowadays. (A math background would suggest &#39;x&#39; for one-dimensional spatial indexes and generic variables, a fight I&#39;ve gotten into too many times to care about anymore.

 I realise I&#39;m rewatching this from a year ago but nevermind.  I&#39;d guess the reason programmers use i as a counter is because mathematicians to.  When using sigma notation, you&#39;re effectively doing a for loop and summing the results together.  It&#39;s sometimes written with i=___ below the sigma to define the starting point and the maximum written above the sigma, with the &quot;loop&quot; being written in terms of i.  It can also be written in terms of n (again, programmers do this), but &quot;nested&quot; sigma loops can be written with i and j (again, programmers).

Instead of just putting the numbers into the code, i created a variable for each of the number( 3 and 5). <br>for i in range(1, 101):<br>    fizz = 3<br>    buzz = 5<br>    if i % (buzz) == 0 and i % (fizz) == 0:<br>        print(&quot;fizzbuzz&quot;)<br>    elif i % (fizz) == 0:<br>        print(&quot;fizz&quot;)<br>    elif i % (buzz) == 0:<br>        print(&quot;buzz&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        print(i)<br>Please tell me if this is a good or bad way to solve it. If its bad, tell me why. Thanks!

 Tom.  It&#39;s probable someone else has answered this, but there are 3,100 comments on this video and I don&#39;t plan to read them all looking.  The reason I personally use(d) &quot;i&quot; as a loop counter variable was because it handily serves as a shorthand for both &quot;integer&quot; and either &quot;iteration&quot; or &quot;index&quot;.

 This is surprising to a 16 year old still in the beginning of college where my current understanding of code is that of python and some beginnings of C# yet this concept seems entirely simple.

In fact the complete opposite, an interviewer asking this is just a massive red flag to any competent applicants. FizzBuzz is about as far as you can get from an actual good interviewing question.

 ideally you shouldn&#39;t initialise and define your string at the same time, since that&#39;s a little slower than doing it as opposed to when you need it.<br><br>oh, and always use preincrements unless absolutely necessary.. no idea why, but parasofts profiler doesn&#39;t like it :p

 Hi Tom, great video, but that&#39;s not how the FizzBuzz I know works! In the version I have played many times, numbers that are divisible by or contain the key numbers have to be Fizz or Buzz - so 13, 23 and all the numbers from 30 to 39 contain Fizz, and so on. It means you need additional tests to search for the key numbers in the index value... Strangely, nobody else seems to have commented this before; perhaps it is a local variant that I played. Try it, though - it&#39;s much harder than your version, and a great pub game...

 Exactly how I would have done it and I am not a Java programmer but still understood.  Its something I have a problem with at work that there are non-programmers being hired based on circumstantial experience and they dont have that programmers mindset.<br><br>One recent SQL project I was asked to take over had a stored procedure with over 46 temporary tables and 3000 lines of code, all tables named numerical so &quot;Table10&quot; and &quot;Table45&quot;.  Needless to say when I was done with it, it was down to 500 lines and only one table that was created for the dataset results.  But I experience this at work all the time sadly.  As tech has become easier to use through GUI, the fundamentals of programming and problem solving are a lost art.  As stated in the video &quot;You shouldn&#39;t run the same test twice&quot; is an alien concept to some people.<br><br>When I was hiring, our test was to write the code to make a cup of tea.

 using &quot;i&quot; as a loop variable dates back to ForTran. In ForTran, variables were one letter and most were automatically real/float but a few (I don&#39;t remember how many) starting at &quot;i&quot; for &quot;Integer&quot; were automatically integers (and ideal candidates for loop indexes). ForTran was a diabolical language. I always like to use &quot;c&quot; for loop counters &#39;cus I still get a pathetic geeky thrill out of writing &quot;C++&quot; and it being valid code.

 The way i was taught to putput was to use the &quot;System.out.print&quot; and &quot;System.out.println&quot; commands. Which would ms ke this easier because you could use the &quot;System.out.print&quot; command so that it wouldn&#39;t go the the next line after it output a number/word. Then just have it move to the next line at the end of the loop using a new line command. I know there any many many ways to do it.

 Not sure that the languages I could use (Not C, C++, or Java) would even be understandable by anyone asking me to do this test.  I expect that they would be able to understand my flowchart for it though.  COBOL and SNOBOL would be impractical and too time consuming for this if I wrote the actual entire code stream.

 I always thought we used the variable &quot;i&quot; as the loop counter for &quot;for&quot; loops because its effectively the &quot;iterator&quot; or &quot;index&quot; to what you&#39;re looping. Because &quot;for&quot; loops are often thought of as iterating a range or series, and if you&#39;re looping a series(list, array, linkedlist) the &quot;i&quot; variable is your index in languages like C where standard data structures and primitives don&#39;t have an iterator trait, method, or otherwise(like pythons &quot;for in&quot; loops). But &quot;while&quot; loops typically name the variable according to its actually specific use most of the time like &quot;continue&quot;(assuming its not a reserved word in your given language) or &quot;x != 10&quot; where &quot;x&quot; is simply just a common variable name as it is in algebra.<br><br>Also start your loops at zero, it drives me nuts.

 If you give me that test I simply write down the solution line by line with no backtracking and no insertions. The only thing you learn about me is that I know this test already. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a stupid interview question. Considering that my resume lists years of programming it would also be insulting as it would suggest I&#39;m lying on my resume.

 Of course, FizzBuzz assumes that people should be thinking of architecture and the updating process all the time. What I think happens is that people choose the path of least resistance.<br><br>It&#39;s a small program that isn&#39;t expected to change that much? Quick-and-dirty usually works just fine.<br><br>You&#39;re working on creating the next-gen operating system? Architecture is a must.<br><br>So when they see a short list of simple product requirements (that don&#39;t even imply coding for the future), architecture isn&#39;t really going to matter. Scale the program up and they&#39;ll change priorities.<br><br>Hence why this test isn&#39;t indicative of how good a programmer is.<br><br>def fizzbuzz(k):<br> div3 = (k%3 == 0)<br> div5 = (k%5 == 0)<br> if (div3 and div5):<br>  print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;<br> elif (div3):<br>  print &quot;Fizz&quot;<br> elif (div5):<br>  print &quot;Buzz&quot;<br> else:<br>  print k<br><br>def game(list_of_numbers, func):<br> for k in list_of_numbers:<br>  func(k)<br><br>game(range(1,101), fizzbuzz)<br><br>There, a simple python program that takes a univariate function and a list of numbers to play a game. At no point do I expect any changes. If there&#39;s a major change, no amount of abstraction would help (&quot;oh, you want a banking system now?&quot;). If there&#39;s a single minor change, it wouldn&#39;t take that long to modify the program. The only time you&#39;d consider changing the algorithm is when the update process simply doesn&#39;t scale anymore.<br><br>For example, insert sort is still fine for &lt;100 items despite being O(n^2) and if you&#39;ve always been dealing with &lt;100 items, then there&#39;s no need to change. If you&#39;re suddenly expecting or noticing an increase, then you might consider updating if there are scaling issues.<br><br>The same applies to the updating process and in turn, the architecture. Only change it when necessary, lest you&#39;d be wasting the company time and money on things that will never be needed.

 I would say the reason for using &quot;i&quot; as the counter for a loop is because it is a suitable short hand for the word &quot;iterator&quot;.<br>It could also be derived from the word &quot;integer&quot; as it describes exactly what is is in many cases where the value isn&#39;t really important for what is inside the loop.<br>Most people however has only acquired the habit because of snippets provided by their IDE (integrated development environment) or because that&#39;s whatever their teacher showed them.

 I don&#39;t get why nobody has looked at the (i % 3 == 0) &amp;&amp; (i % 5 == 0) and realised it&#39;s equivalent to (i % 15 == 0) or defining two constants, say x := 3, y := 5 and using:<br>if i % (x * y) == 0 then &quot;fizzbuzz<br>else if i % x == 0 then &quot;fizz&quot;<br>else if i % y == 0 then &quot;buzz&quot;<br>else ToString(i)<br><br>It&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s cleaner looking than doing two remainder equal to zero expressions with an and.

 Future maintainability: define Fizz and Buzz as keys in an array with 3 and 5 as the values.  For your test, iterate over the array using modulus with the values and concatenate the keys to your output.  One loop, one test (also a loop) and infinite room to expand.

 So you challenge us to find a more efficient solution?

Doing a test for &quot;if i % 15... else if 1 % 5... else if 1 % 3... else&quot; will go over fine.

Fortran had rules to infer types of variables depending on how they conformed to old mathematical conventions (i,j,k are ints, x,y,z float), and &quot;i&quot; is the typical subscript for the index in a series.

 Reminds me of EVE Online. The game is an MMO, constantly being developed for, and is nearing 15 years old. This means that the level of coding and recoding that has happened over a decade and a half has turned parts of the game&#39;s programing into a confusing spaghetti mess of things. <br><br>There was an annoying bug causing a few small but noticeable issues that was fixed recently. The developers nicknamed it &quot;sleeping beauty&quot; because it was a mistake that sat dormant for a long number of years before new additions to the code caused it to activate and start issues. It was a relatively small mistake made over a decade ago and here it is now causing hell. <br><br>This sort of stuff is why I&#39;m doing computer engineering not computer science.

 just order your if statements by most requirements to least. If true true, then fizzbuzz. Else if true false, then fizz. Else if false true, then buzz. Else if false false, then print counter. No extra variables, same number of if statements, just use your loop counter and explicit strings.

 I learned to code C from an old book from the 80s, and the book said that &#39;i&#39; stands for iteration. And that&#39;s the way I have been thinking about it ever since.

 For the FizzBuzz part, you could also test if the variable is divisible by 15. I think doing that on the interview would show some ability to examine math itself for a solution.

 I don&#39;t think Tom really understands the reason it&#39;s used. Many people turn up to programming interviews simply unable to write code that compiles/runs. This screens for those. That&#39;s it, really.<br><br>There is no right answer for it. Like most high-level programming scenarios, there is a trade off between extensibility for new methods and extensibility for new objects. In this video, Tom went down the methods route. In addition, you can abstract yourself into a FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition hole, where each step towards idealism just makes the codebase harder to use.<br><br>If you&#39;re zealous about one style over another in the face of specifications or style guides, you&#39;re probably a poor programmer anyway.<br><br>Nobody should really be drawing any conclusions from how extensible someone makes a whiteboard programming challenge. In fact, if anything, the questions they ask about the spec are more important.<br><br>For fun, find the thousands of more idealised solutions to this problem that don&#39;t compile and run. You&#39;ll have come full circle.

 I see too many ppl trying to minimize the code, making it totally unreadable. On my team I would severely reprimand somebody using such code. The thing is that today, with current compilers, the compiled code could be even worse trying to offuscate it with onliners, it makes no sense, moreover with todays more than enough computing power.<br><br>My READABLE take on this one, using sort of pseudocode:<br><br>const string FIZZ=&quot;Fizz&quot;;<br>const string BUZZ=&quot;Buzz&quot;;<br><br>(iteration i) {<br>   if (i % 15==0) {<br>      print FIZZ+BUZZ;<br>   else if (i % 5==0)<br>      print BUZZ;<br>   else if (i % 3==0)<br>      print FIZZ;<br>   else<br>      print i;<br>}<br><br>On the other hand, when I used to work programming micro controllers I remember using a &quot;C&quot; language that converted to ASM, and used to check how it compiled and if using While or Do-While was more efficient and using less cycles, but those where extreme measurses when you only had a couple of KB to cramp the code, and where RAM was measured in bytes without a prefix.

 My approach (though I didn&#39;t actually type it up) was to generate a 15-entry lookup table with &quot;Fizz&quot; in the multiples of 3, &quot;Buzz&quot; in the multiples of 5, &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; in slot 0 and NULLs elsewhere. Then inside the loop do a lookup of array[i%15] and output the number if the lookup returned NULL and the string if not.

 One thing that popped into my mind just as I was hearing how the game works is that you could potentially save processing power and time (say for much much bigger numbers than 100) is for the program to void <b>prime numbers</b>. I&#39;m not a programmer, so I don&#39;t know how you would implement that but, if the progam has go through every single integer and check certain parameters in each of them, if it was given an list of all known prime numbers at the beginning then it wouldn&#39;t need to check through every single number and just the ones that are not primes.

 I&#39;ve always thought of i as shorthand for index, although somebody has also pointed out history from Fortran that seems plausible.  Your implimentation is pretty much what I&#39;d do, to make it really efficient though you&#39;d want to avoid string concatenations.

 The last code you showed no longer repeats the mod test, but now it seems to make an assumption that could easily change in the future. What if multiples of 15 should result in an entirely new word, rather than a combo of the %3 and %5 rules. You&#39;d have to entirely rewrite the code, unless there is a clever solution. Thoughts?

 This is exactly the kind of stuff I learned in my theory-heavy CS program in college. I see a problem like this and immediately think &quot;sentinel variable!&quot; Not particularly elegant, but it works. As the video went on, and the idea of adding other variables was introduced, I found you can easily adapt the sentinel variable concept to make a function that takes an arbitrary list of divisors to word mapping and plays the game.

 That&#39;s a clever way of doing it when you&#39;re just asked to concatenate lines in a rigid order. I was personally thinking more along the lines of running each check once and recording the results in a unified variable of some sort, then printing the result based on that variable. That adds a set of &quot;encoding&quot; and &quot;decoding&quot; steps, however, which might be over-thinking the issue a little. I mean, technically speaking you can just store the result of the division check in a boolean variable such as<br><br>boolean fizz = (i % 3 == 0)<br><br>since the == operator returns a variable of type boolean anyway, which if() then runs with. At least I think it does... Not familiar enough with JavaScript.<br><br>The cool bit with that is you can actually create a number-word hashmap to check against and a number-boolean hashmap to store the results in, making this extensible by the user (or more likely, another programme in a &quot;black box&quot; style design arrangement) by simply supplying the method with a the number-word hashmap. Because it&#39;s a hashmap with the number as the primary key, you don&#39;t have to worry about duplicate values and because it&#39;s a linked data structure, your programme doesn&#39;t have to account for its size - just loop from 0 to size - 1.<br><br>FizzBuzz is not a bad idea, though. I should try it on my own students. Thanks for the video :)

 I think the variable has traditionally been called &quot;i&quot; as it is the &quot;index&quot;. In foreach loops, you often see the variables &quot;k&quot; (for &quot;key&quot;) and &quot;v&quot; (for &quot;value&quot;) being used. Single character variable names are normally used for brevity, and the normal practice is that these small variable names are normally only used in a local context (so declaring a variable of &quot;i&quot;, &quot;k&quot; or &quot;v&quot; should not see any important variables being overwritten.

 My knowledge of code extends to relatively basic Excel sheets (i got really bored and programmed a dodgy Conway&#39;s Game of Life once), but for what it&#39;s worth i&#39;d say if divisible by three and not divisible by five, then &quot;fizz&quot;. If nlt divisible by 3 and divisible by five then &quot;buzz&quot;. If divisible by three and divisible by five then &quot;fizzbuzz&quot;. If not divisible by three or five then &quot;i&quot;.

 wrong..2:24 .... assigns the variable(s), checks the condition(s) then goes inside the for loop. once it reaches the end, increments/decrements the variable(s) and tests the condition again.

 We just did a little bit of coding in college. We had to make a Roulette Table with all the variable of Odd, Even, Red, Black, Green etc along with integrating a betting system and a bank. I honestly am so glad no one has to maintain that program because even I could barely read it after leaving it for a week. It was a classic bodge. I got it to work for when the marker tested it and be damned if it ever worked again. The funniest thing was that if you put a letter (or literally anything other than a number) into the box used to choose which number you wanted to bet on it would crash completely. I used a combo Box for every variable you&#39;d wish to choose other than the one for 0-36. Lucky the marker didn&#39;t try to bet his dog otherwise I think I&#39;d have failed.

 Your method for fizzbuzz is inefficient, every time you  do output += &quot;words&quot; you create a new string object that isn&#39;t referenced anymore if you do it again. so at the end you would have 100 String objects which slows the program down :D

 As someone who knows a bit of basic C++, this was basically instantly recognizable.<br>Also, if memory serves, C++ uses only ifs and no if elses, which seeing as way back in high school they started us off in Visual Basic, kinda bugged me. I remember when they switched us over to C++ I thought pretty much instantly that VB was stupidly archaic in comparison, but that if, if else, else system always makes more sense to me.<br>Still don&#39;t care for coding though. Esp. the college coding class I took a while back where they made us stick to a specific way of formatting. Don&#39;t like that, too rigid and inflexible in my eyes.

 I&#39;ve got a thought that you could probably make it more robust by defining the checks and results as two Lists at the top of the program and have the program run through each member of the list as a loop until it hits the end, then it outputs the compiled response list or the number if it&#39;s empty. Means you only have two lines to change if the needs do and also it gives a handy starting point for converting the code to get it&#39;s lists dynamically from another part of the program.

 So, I wrote this when you told us to try it for ourselves:<br><br>for(int i=1;i&lt;=100;i++){<br>  String out = str(i);<br>  if(i%3==0){<br>    out = &quot;Fizz&quot;;<br>  } <br>  if(i%5==0){<br>    out = &quot;Buzz&quot;;<br>  }<br>  if(i%3==0&amp;&amp;i%5==0){<br>    out = &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;;<br>  }<br>  println(out);<br>}<br><br>I thought it was good enough, and of course it&#39;s fairly similar to your last example. Though I would have never thought to make sure comparisons were only run once! <br><br>I had always heard of &#39;clean code&#39; but no one ever really told me what that was. Or rather, what defined clean code. I always heard things like &quot;No more than 25 lines per subroutine&quot; or &quot;Make your class names as descriptive as possible&quot;, but even after following those rules, my code still turned out messy! <br><br>It&#39;s awesome that you added that small piece of wisdom, and I&#39;m definitely going to keep in mind when I code from here on to only run a test once.

 This is certainly fine for kids right out of college, when you have to determine whether they&#39;ve actually learned anything that can be actually applied on the job. But I, a software engineer with 45 years experience across several major companies and working on numerous successful projects, have encountered job interviews where they gave me tests like this. The most frustrating was at a start-up company where the two principles were clearly, themselves, right out of college, and they gave a test that could easily have come from one of their own recent classes in programming. Frankly, it feels rather insulting.<br><br>If you were hiring a carpenter for some job and they&#39;ve already built fifteen houses, would you say, &quot;Here&#39;s a hammer, let&#39;s see how well you can hit this nail?&quot;

 For C++, I would&#39;ve used a switch statement. I wouldn&#39;t put END in the test for console.write(&quot;Fizz&quot;) so it could be free to fall down and also do the test for console.write(&quot;Buzz&quot;). The normal case would be console.write(i). Then after the switch statement, there&#39;d be console.writeline() to make a new line.<br><br>However, switch statements were kind of premade to make things like this more elegant, weren&#39;t they?

 Oh, I did this during class. Actually several times. This and problems like it seem to be the go-to introductory lab for every language nowadays.

 Throw all the special numbers in one array and all the words in another.  For-each loop that shiz.  Or, depending, you might want to use a list of key-value pairs, but that might land you in more trouble than it&#39;s worth.  Arrays are a little neater, even if you need two of them.<br><br>.........Maybe I should get back into coding.  This is making me feel things.

 I actually liked the previous solution better. Sure, you should always think ahead and write maintainable code. But you should also not preoptimize. For the stated requirements the previous solution was more straightforward and simpler than the last one. What if a requirement change wouldn&#39;t address making 5 to 7, but rather writing &quot;Fizzbuzz&quot; instead of &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;. Then you would need to change your whole solution.

 So, I&#39;ve used this exact problem over the years in software dev interviews (usually as a screening interview question done in a phone interview, using a tool like collabedit) because... so many people tend to flounder on it. It&#39;s not a test that if you pass you get a job. It&#39;s a test to see if it&#39;s even worth continuing with the process. I have a lot of other tests as well, but this is a good &quot;check for pulse&quot; starting point.<br><br>One thing that does cause some otherwise good people to stumble a little is if they don&#39;t have the one factoid they need here that makes it much easier: what the % operator is. And since I&#39;m not testing for &quot;knows all the arithmetic and bitwise operators&quot; (although that can be a fun question too!) I&#39;ll give up that hint if asked.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve had... 33% of candidates? (more if they&#39;re junior) bounce off of this one. One or two who gave away signs they googled the answer. And one who must have googled the answer and didn&#39;t let any evidence slip up during follow on questions, because when I brought that person in for an on-site interview it was a trainwreck.

 your last solution looks simple and elegant but to assemble the output like needs reallocation of memory which is a very expensive task.<br>so even if it means that your code is a little bit longer using fixed strings for &quot;fizz&quot;,&quot;buzz&quot; and &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; will speed up your program quite a lot.

 Personally, I&#39;d declare the variables and replacement words outside the loop as a two dimensional array, then have an inner loop which iterates through the array until all values are met. Therefore, if the parameters are changed, you only need to tweak the first few lines of the code, without needing to touch the loop.

 My only major gripe with the test as-is is you have to know what the interviewer wants to see. Are they speed-oriented? Just type Tom&#39;s first example. Do they care more about semantics? I wouldn&#39;t abuse `output` like that, that needs a dedicated `isFizzOrBuzz` bool.  Or are they perhaps performance-oriented? Better not use string concatenation then, as that&#39;s a relatively expensive operation.

 Well, I&#39;m going to be fussy, but in JS, you can write :<br> if (!i%3){...} or if(!output) {...}<br><br>In programming loop, you can also improve by typing ++i instead of i++ (++i means increment then read, i++ means read, then increment) to avoid reading twice the value of i (on incrementing and on checking condition)<br><br>Otherwise it&#39;s a good exercise to evaluate how a person can think, I still think we need to test someone on his knowledge about design pattern and understanding why it&#39;s important :)<br><br>Good video !

 This is a great test! Assuming they can actually write something that works, a good second thing to look out for is that the interviewee doesn&#39;t try to do something <b>too</b> clever. Often even someone competent will get bogged down trying to do something general that they think the interviewer&#39;s looking for. But more than that, even if your clever solution works, in the real world overly general solutions are a terrible idea because software always ends needing extending in a totally different way than you anticipate.

 What you could do to avoid repeating the code is to use a dictionnary or a 2D array and test every key and see if it&#39;s a divider of the number, then add the corresponding string to the output.

 These kind of problems are called Code Katas. We use a couple as technical tests, but the &#39;scoring&#39; is rarely about the problem. As with maths exams, you get a point for the correct answer, but you get several points for the &#39;working out&#39;. In or case that includes how often you commit your code, your approach to Test Driven Development, and knowledge of coding principles like SOLID, or design patterns. Our current favourite is the String Calculator, but I think I might see how well Fizz Buzz works instead.

 Id say you put the factors into an array and do the test for each item in the array. That way you just have to add an item to the array when you want to add a factor, and you only have to change one number:<br>for($i=1;$i&lt;=100;$i++){<br> $output=&quot;&quot;;<br> $test = array(3=&gt;&quot;fizz&quot;,5=&gt;&quot;buzz&quot;);<br> foreach($test as $x =&gt; $x_value){<br>  if($i%$x==0){<br>   $output .= $x_value;<br>  }<br> }<br> if($output==&quot;&quot;){<br>  $output=$i;<br> }<br> echo $output.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br>}

 If you have the option to not automatically print a new line, you can do it differently.<br><br>You can always print fizz if it&#39;s %3 and buzz if it&#39;s %5 and the number if it&#39;s neither, and <b>then</b> go to the next line. However, if prints or checks are very expensive, you end up with twice as many checks always and technically 2 (once for what you want to print and once for the new line) or 3 (Fizz, Buzz, \n) prints so I suppose it&#39;s not optimal. On the other hand, if string concatenation is expensive, then this version is better.<br><br>C code:<br><br>for(int i=1;i&lt;101;i++){<br>if (i%3==0){<br>printf(&quot;Fizz&quot;);<br>}<br>if (i%5==0){<br>printf(&quot;Buzz&quot;);<br>}<br>if(i%5!=0 &amp;&amp; i%3 != 0)<br>{<br>printf(&quot;%d&quot;,i);<br>}<br>printf(&quot;\n&quot;);<br>}<br>return 0;

 Woah, I did the exact same thing as you apparently did on first try.<br><br>I also wrote a version that doesn&#39;t use the modulo operator because it&#39;s technically a bit more expensive, using the fact that the pattern that Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz appear in between regular numbers is exactly the same every 15 numbers. It&#39;s just in pseudocode:<br><br>Multiple = 1<br>While True {<br> For i = 1 to 15 {<br>  If i = 3, 6, 9, 12:    Out = &quot;Fizz<br>  Elif i = 5, 10:         Out = &quot;Buzz&quot;<br>  Elif i = 15:             Out = &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;<br>  Else:                      Out = i * Multiple <br> }<br> Multiple++<br>}<br><br>Obviously this isn&#39;t exactly extensible, and I probably wouldn&#39;t do this unless I really needed optimisation over everything else, but it&#39;s fun to do that sometimes.

 Just to be a pedant, the gaurd for the for loop is checked before executing the code in the loop. In this way it is possible that the loop will run 0 times and it means that the statements in the for statement parenthesis are executed in the order that they are stated.

 An issue with the concatenating strings approach is what if the interviewer told you to change it to output a different phrase on multiples of 15 instead of FizzBuzz.

 I have a small issue with outputting FizzBuzz like you did. If the interviewer asks &quot;OK so now I want the output to be Bazinga when i is a multiple of 3 and 5&quot;, you&#39;d have to modify your code structure, whether if you treat it as a particular if statement you just have to change the output.

There&#39;s also little practical distinction in trading your divisions for a counter in memory. It might be more efficient for some calculations but the trade off is increased memory usage. This example would see little distinction between the two, and a counter would arguably over-complicate things for the person who came to maintain your code afterward, which is also an important factor. It&#39;s dangerous to assume you are the only one who will look at your code so you can write it however you like. All of this is a bit baseless as arguments since we are talking about a very childish function, but you can see hopefully how some of these considerations would play out on large more complex behaviors.']

 This video was super helpful but I want some honest opinions.

I also feel like I could answer questions like this very easily and have practiced other ones similar to this that I even feel are harder. My question is it even worth it in your opinion to get a degree in computer science when I could focus more on the field from home possibly and if so would I be ready to apply for jobs now?

 I shall assert with only anecdotal evidence that programmers tend to use &#39; i &#39; in for(;;) loops because for(;;) is frequently used to index arrays, (in C, &quot; array[index] &quot; accesses the index-th element of the array). Also because the last section of the for loop is the &quot; for(initializer; comparitor; incrementor)  &quot;.  I believe it&#39;s for those reasons that &#39; i &#39; is the most frequently used. The second most common I&#39;ve seen, mostly in loops that dont index arrays, is &#39; c &#39; for count.  So &quot; C++ &quot; is both a reference to the C style increment and also one of the most frequent statements in the language.

 My instinct was going to be using flags.  Set up flag vars.  do the modulo tests that trip the flags, then have the output based on which flags are ones or zeroes. and reset all flags to 0 at the start of the next loop.  This has a little benefit of giving you some extra flexibility to do other things in each iteration of the loop, but is horribly inefficient for the basic example, and this is why I&#39;m not a programmer.

 As a programmer. i stands for iterator.  Some people will tell you it&#39;s index, and that&#39;s not necessarily wrong, if you think of it as the index of our position of iterations, but iterator still would make more sense. Once i has been used (say we&#39;re nesting loops, for creating/using a 2d array for example) we often carry on using mathematical convention, and just use the next free letter, so j, then k.

 JavaScript you should do “===“ as best practice.

 I would make a function where two parameters were Fizz and Buzz, then call that function each time. For example, playFizzBuzz(3,5) where multiples of 3 make fizz and multiples of 5 make buzz. That way if it wanted to be seven and eleven, playFizzBuzz(7,11) would still work.

 The real test is not about the logic, it&#39;s about making assumptions. I&#39;ve used fizzbuzz to interview dozens of candidates and most of them, when you say &quot;one to a hundred&quot; start their index at 0 and use a &quot;&lt; 100&quot; condition in their loop. Obviously, this is not 1-100. This tells me that while, yes, you can probably apply your programming skills, you may have a tough time interpreting specifications correctly.

 Tom Scott should you not start with the pseudo code find your efficient logic path then deal with language after? As you should be able to translate the program quickly into what ever language they ask same as changing the variables and conditions in the code. Love your work no hate btw. Also why not make your fizz and buzz a variable storing the value of 3 and 5 to check against it would read better if you are changing the value and not the condition. Basically you get &quot; if i = fizz do fizz thing&quot; (I&#39;m simplifying a bit)

 You could probably write the program by using &quot;fizz&quot; and &quot;buzz&quot; counters. Increase them on every iteration; if any of them are maxed, output the corresponding string and reset the counter. If none are maxed, output the number. That way you don&#39;t have to do the module operation, which will probably make the whole thing faster.<br>...I&#39;m overthinking this, right? 

 	Replies: ['ChevronTango', 'Depends on the scale of what you are trying to do. For a simple problem like this, that&#39;s definitely overkill, and you should trust your compiler/interpreter to know how to optimize, particularly if you&#39;re within the limited scope of 32 bit signed integers and a relatively small test set. As your problem space increases, however, there will come a tipping point where it&#39;s arguably quicker to trade runtime calculations for memory. This is true of every application with a performance consideration. In this case you&#39;d be adding more calculations, some with constant runtime, some not, with the hopes that as you get bigger or more complex, your increased memory usage by storing these counters would pay off and allow these operations to run faster. Practically this would depend on your language and compiler, and as an interviewer, I wouldn&#39;t expect an applicant to do any of this, but understanding the risks and concerns that go along with this thinking when asked about it would be a big tick in their favor.']

 My result after pausing at the start -- I&#39;ve never heard of Fizzbuzz before but this is my python attack<br><br><br>loop = 100<br><br>for i in range(1, loop):<br>    response = &quot;&quot;<br>    if i % 3 == 0:<br>        response += &quot;fizz&quot;<br>    if i % 5 == 0:<br>        response += &quot;buzz&quot;<br>    if response == &quot;&quot;:<br>        response += str(i);<br>    print(response)<br><br>Rather than testing for &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; as a separate option, I allow fizz and buzz to be appended to one another since both checks happen regardless. THis means I can ignore multiples of 15 as &#39;&#39;fizzbuzz.<br><br>I don&#39;t think fizzbuzz occurs outside of 15&#39;s because of that I was considering a switch statement in c++ with 15, then 3, then 5, then default case

 For those who enjoy doing this sort of thing, there&#39;s a site called HackerRank which, among other things, will give you problems of increasing difficulty/complexity and get you to solve them. It makes you think of the performance so you might get the right answer for a simple example but the more complicated or longer examples it then tries take longer than it&#39;ll let your code run for and so fail.

 That bit at the end about computer science degrees... it&#39;s why I&#39;ve always felt that most CS jobs should be treated more as a vocation than a profession, if that makes sense. The basics of complexity theory are important, but shouldn&#39;t the emphasis reality be on building flexible, maintainable code? That&#39;s what most of these students are going to be doing out in the real world. My undergrad program has two small upper-level classes on software development, but several times that in courses on algorithm design, compiler theory, predicate logic, probability theory... I&#39;m having to teach myself how to do write good code, because our professors are academics who would rather teach about algorithms than style

 Tom, use of a switch/case statement would make your logical thought steps 10000000 times easier. :p And boosts your readability of your code substantially as well to boot! Also using variables for your &quot;3s 5s&quot; etc means if you needed to change your specific variable of say 3 to 7 it&#39;s one change and everything else changes. Good test though.

 A few people are speculating that <i>i</i> is short for &quot;iterator&quot;, or &quot;integer&quot;. I decided to look this up and apparently it dates back to Fortran.

 Programmers use &quot;i&quot; as the default counter name because of Fortran. By default variables starting with letters i and beyond (alphabetically) were &quot;implicitly&quot; integers (integer class by default). &quot;h&quot; would have been a floating point number by default, I think.

I don&#39;t recall the name, but this is considered part of an older but well known naming scheme.
