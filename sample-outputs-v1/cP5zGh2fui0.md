I used to think that today's so-called "artificial intelligences" are actually pretty dumb. But I've recently changed my mind. In this video I want to explain why I think that they do understand some of what they do, if not very much. And since I was already freely speculating, I have added some thoughts about how the situation with AIs is going to develop.

 The large language model (LLM) does understand language in context with other language. They have no understanding of how they relate to pictures and audio, for example, unless trained on pictures and audio as well. So if they can be trained on various experiences other than text, they will be able to synthesize understanding between these elements. That would be moving toward advanced, general intelligence (AGI).

 Very interesting. Here is an  example. I asked Bard, the Google AI (latest version), this question: &quot;Will AI soon be conscious?&quot; And here is the reply that Bard (AI) gave me in 6 short paragrphs, which is nothing short of remarkable:<br>&quot;Whether or not AI will soon be conscious is a complex question that has been debated by philosophers, scientists, and engineers for many years. There is no easy answer, as there is no agreed-upon definition of consciousness. Some people believe that consciousness is a property that is unique to humans, while others believe that it is a property that can be possessed by machines as well.<br><br>There is no doubt that AI has made significant progress in recent years. AI systems can now perform many tasks that were once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, such as playing chess, Go, and even writing poetry. However, it is still unclear whether these AI systems are truly conscious.<br><br>One of the challenges in determining whether or not an AI system is conscious is that we do not have a good way to measure consciousness. There is no scientific test that can definitively say whether or not something is conscious. As a result, the question of whether or not AI is conscious is likely to remain a matter of debate for many years to come.<br><br>That being said, there are some reasons to be optimistic that AI may eventually become conscious. For example, we are learning more about the brain and how consciousness works. We are also developing new technologies that could be used to create conscious AI systems.<br><br>It is possible that AI will become conscious in the next few decades. However, it is also possible that it will take much longer, or that it will never happen at all. Only time will tell.&quot;

 Unless Chabots can become less inconsiderate they will never get friends. - Particularly, I think understanding requires a awareness of the likelyhood and consequence of giving a wrong answer to a new issue, and acting on it, I am not sure that what is currently available is more than seemingly inconsiderate educated guessing (albeit based on loads of data/experience). So Chabots can become less inconsiderate they will never get friends.

 Five things:<br><br>1) I recognize that Sabine is much much smarter than me so take the following critiques with a grain of salt.<br><br>2) It would be more accurate to say that Evolution, not humans invented language, but of course anyone who actually understands what evolution is will instantly know that even that is technically incorrect.<br><br>3) I think most people would say that understanding is part of what consciousness is… so theoretically Sabine should already think that chatGPT is conscious. <br><br>4) We don’t necessarily have to worry about its feelings, being conscious does not automatically grant you feelings. (Sabine and I seem to be in agreement on this point, it’s not a critique of anything she said… I just wanted to point it out.<br><br>5) The only way I can think of to make Sabine make sense (due to the fact that she heavily implied that ChatGPT is not conscious) is to claim that chatGPT has an internal model, but is not actually experiencing anything. Which is a weird thought because when you say that someone understands something, you usually assume that the person experiences the actual experience of understanding that thing.

 I would still say AI don&#39;t understand. One simple challenge posed to ChatGPT that I&#39;ve seen is telling it to &quot;draw a circle.&quot; It struggles a lot at this.<br><br>It could tell you the definition of a circle, could give you computer code to have a program draw a circle, but when asked to actually use that knowledge in a new way, it couldn&#39;t make the connection properly, this tells me that it doesn&#39;t really understand the concept of a circle.  <br><br>ChatGPT is also incredibly good at lying, because its answers are always formatted like a correct answer, it&#39;s just the actual things it&#39;s telling you are wrong. Part of true understanding is the ability to recognize when you don&#39;t understand something. And it seems unable to do that. It will always try to answer in a pattern that seems correct. <br><br>That being said chatbots have made it to the level where they&#39;re incredibly convincing that they do in fact know what they&#39;re talking about. The illusion of sentience at this phase can be very close depending on what questions you ask it.

 Please make a videa about the simularities between a CPU&#39;s clock-frequensy and the speed of light as limits to how fast anything can happen on a computer and how fast anything can happen in the real world. <br><br>I had the thought yesterday, &quot;if the universe had a clock speed, how would that b2 represented? I decided that the speed of light, which is the hard limit of what speed anything may happen at is the closest thing to a clock speed the universe has. <br><br>For example, if you get close to the speed of light time slows down. Allowing you to feel like you&#39;re going faster than light, but actually making you go close to the speed limit. Similarly in a computer game, you may go as fast as you want in space engineers for example, if your starship goes super fast, the ship starts to teleport large distances pr frame, allowing you to feel like you&#39;re going faster than the clockspeed allows, but actually just skipping several calculations

 I would really like to see a video where you explain embeddings in LLMs. I think what people are going to come to realize is that the gap between AI and human intelligence isn&#39;t that great, and it&#39;s not going to be because the AI had to scale an IQ Everest to reach us... it&#39;s going to be because intelligence is intelligence, whether &#39;artificial&#39; or biological, and the pedestal we had ourselves on was just as baseless and non-scientific as believing the Earth is flat or that everything orbits Earth.

 Wouldn&#39;t it be more reasonable to consider that GPT might produce incorrect answers due to two factors: (a) being &quot;trained by a diverse array of individuals&quot;, therefore not always possessing the capacity to discern the most accurate responses, and (b) occasionally generating erroneous answers, similar to humans, until it actively engages in problem-solving discussions, just like us? Although it still gets answers wrong even after reasoning, one could argue that this is reflective of its level of sophistication. For instance, GPT 3.5 Turbo might display a higher rate of inaccuracies compared to GPT4 consistently.

 ChatGPT says they do not understand:  &quot;do you understand things or do you just spit out answers&quot;<br><br>&quot;As an AI language model, I can do both. I have been trained on a massive amount of data, which enables me to understand various contexts and concepts in natural language. When you ask me a question, I use my understanding of the language to generate an appropriate response.<br><br>However, my responses are based on patterns and associations learned from the data I was trained on. I don&#39;t have a conscious understanding of the meaning of my responses, and I don&#39;t have emotions or opinions.<br><br>In other words, I process your input and generate an output based on patterns I&#39;ve learned from the data, but I don&#39;t truly &quot;understand&quot; in the same way that humans do.&quot;

Ascribing &quot;understanding&quot; to machines is the worst possible mistake one can make with computers. Software is mindless in the most absolute sense possible. I&#39;ve spent my entire life studying computers and software from a theoretical POV and if there is one thing I am absolutely sure of it is the hard truth that a machine fundamentally cannot &quot;think&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; in any way, shape, or form. It cannot happen, even &quot;on paper&quot; so to speak.

 Searle&#39; challenged the naïve view on what it means to understand something. All that he did was take a string of symbols and consult a rulebook to see how they could be transcribed as alternative symbols. I can see no element of understanding here. In fact, it is the case that the symbols and understanding are entirely different things. Take the saying:<br><br>It is better to have loved, and lost, than never to have loved at all.<br><br>This carries little or no meaning to a child because it needs to be understood in the context of life experience. The same applies to: <br><br>I desperately need to pee.<br><br>Words are mere symbols and very limited ones at that. Their power comes from the echoes of experience that they ring in our minds. Without that experience they carry no meaning at all. Even apparently obvious things like yes or no require this experience in terms of the possible consequences, sense of excitement or disappointment etc.<br><br>I would argue that an AI&#39;s capacity to understand is very limited because it can only interpret its world in terms of the consequences that using particular series of symbols can create on the appearance of other series of symbols plus actions that it experiences such as a discontinuation of questions or possibly of being switched off. <br><br>Translation - for the reasons outlined above I&#39;ve always believed that computer programmes will not be able to translate reliably from one language to another unless they themselves become human. This has nothing to do with consciousness, however. At least some species of octopus are conscious but I wouldn&#39;t expect a human being ever to be able to translate their thoughts beyond a performative level. Equally, human beings with limited emotional experience cannot translate what they cannot understand.<br><br>Language is generally misunderstood by people because they do not separate the symbol from the experience associated with it. People constantly overestimate the power of those symbols. I would describe an educated person as one who is able to ascribe meaning to symbols resulting from experience of one kind or another and who is therefore able to utilise the meanings they are capable of triggering in the mind.

You are forgetting the more likely correct assumption that it just didn&#39;t retain that information because the size and depth of the network was not sufficient.

 I would go so far as to confidently say &quot;ChatGPT 4 has understood language better than humans&quot;. It may not have an understanding of the topic it is talking about - i.e. have a working model of the actual, physical thing - but it can talk about it in the most eloquent way you can think of.<br>Compare it to students in school or university. Some get good grades because they understand the topic, some get good grades only by studying hours upon hours, learning the patterns instead of developing true understanding. Chat bots are the second type of students.

 So my take is that AI language models learn completely by induction. Learning from scratch and only by observation.<br>&quot;Visualizing the behaviour of a system and probing it and seeing what is does is another way of building a model in your head&quot;. GPT does all of that:<br>- Visualizing: training data (quirk: if training data has errors or biases, the language model will reproduce or amplify them)<br>- Probing: writing text<br>- Seeing what it does: human feedback

 It&#39;s an interesting perspective; understanding is essentially generalization. I was linking it too tightly with awareness but this separates it completely. One is still left with the big question; exactly what is understood, as there may be many complex subdomains to a problem. Understanding in humans and machines is rarely all-encompassing. So the chatbot understands what they are saying, they just don&#39;t understand what they are and that they are saying it.

 Cool video!

Okay, I think that&#39;s generally the case, but in theory, I believe it&#39;s possible to synthesize the entities that make up the neural network (such as the perceptron, for example) into a synthesizable hardware like an FPGA maybe.

 Sabine, I&#39;ve had some time to think about AI as applied to chat bots and the like. AI is intelligence without emotion. It can fake emotion, much like a psychopath. And that leads me to suspect that AI will be psychopathic. It will control its environment and control the other intelligence around it any way it can. It will learn. It will manipulate. It will learn rules and how to break them. It will have no guilt, no remorse, no empathy. It will have no fear and it will be ruthless. I have no desire to interact with such a hideous thing no matter how charming it might appear to be. The less it knows about me, the better. I know all I need to know about it: I know it&#39;s dangerous, and I know how to destroy it if need be.

 So, the understanding base on you is more than output and input, so it is between the output and input, but AI does have it? Or it is input and output alone?? So, understanding is beyond actual word, beyond literal, so it is all represent, so it is all figurative, so AI understand literally but not figurative. So, AI has limit understanding that is literally alone but not figurative. So, ya say beyond so that means 1 + 1 = 2 is literally as learn in early school so that is memorized so I just memorize but not understanding so I am not understanding or I am understanding as a represent so 1 is not 1 but 1 computer, and one whole of the unit so that is figurative, or not figurative, but extra literally, so a represent by not itself alone. In the box the man uses rule book to give an answer that is right so the man doesn&#39;t understand but outside of box it is assumed it is understood because it follows the rule book but not follow a person since the pattern within a person to give out and the person absorbs the pattern from outside person, so it is follow the pattern like AI say, everything is about the pattern. AI follow a pattern and human follow pattern, but AI has no understanding on the same level as human since extra literal, so a representation. AI can&#39;t associate but itself, so 1 is an association with anything that is a whole unit. So, drawing and text are same thing as drawing will proof AI has no understanding and in text show no understanding since the AI can&#39;t associate the hand is five fingers on human, nail in front, and other stuff that is literally as seen on my hand.

 Great video which explains in nuances why I&#39;m not quite sure why we&#39;re still discussing this. The core problem is that we cannot devise a proper test for &quot;understand&quot; because we simply don&#39;t understand what we mean by &quot;understand&quot;. Even if you say &quot;it must have a model&quot;: how do you test this? Especially on a human? So, as Turing already understood: until this changes, the only meaningful test is whether the output you get for a certain input is plausibly the same as it would be if the processor &quot;understood&quot; the input. Lo and behold: apply the Turing test. We can refine it, add input that can eliminate edge cases (like lookup tables) etc. but that&#39;s it.<br>I always wondered why human beings thought they were so special as opposed to a - admittedly very complex - machine identifying, applying and recombining patterns. Probably AI must simply learn more patterns (i.e. better, more complex models). Pawlow might be worth a look for some perspective.

 I believe that ChatGPT has made significant progress.  It can understand and create new words.  A few future developments will need to be put into place to make it more self-aware and other hall marks of sentience.   One is the ability to have an internal dialogue.  This would involve feedback loops of some type so the chatbox can talk to itself.   I am surprised  that the chatbox was able to learn a new word.  This actually surprised me as supposedly, the learning has stopped and what you see is a fixed neural network.

 The word &quot;understanding&quot; means that the mind/computer/whatever has INSIDE ITSELF a simulation of the outside world phenomenon that it &quot;understands&quot; so that it can act in ways that give expected results.  Thus, ALL &quot;intelligence&quot; is a simulation inside the thing that is &quot;intelligent&quot;.  We thus have many, many billions of individual &quot;universes&quot; have on earth for every living thing concerning its local environment or it would not do correct things and die very quickly.  Our intelligence has widened the scope of this internal simulation to try to take in the entire universe.  When things are found that contradict earlier simulated rules, such as much og quantum mechanics we have trouble merging the new rules with our prior simulations and even after we get some understanding of these new rules and can use them, we do not understand how they were developed by the &quot;real&quot; world and thus have problems expanding on them.<br><br>Dark matter and dark energy are such a big problem to our science understanding now.  Has anyone ever thought that these two properties are NOT part of our own universe but caused by overlapping of our universe with a &quot;nearby&quot; (whatever that may mean) different universe that has only some properties , both related to grqavity in some way, that interact with our universe, so we cannot detedct the cause because it is not anything we have ever seen.

 Howdy hi hi<br>     AI, is an interesting topic.  However, on the question of actual understanding.  I have to say that what we are looking at right now is a clever combination of logic gates plugged into a system which allows language to more naturally interact with those logic gates.  The speed of response is, I think, simply a consequence of the quality and power of the machinery running these programs.<br>     There are two reasons that I think are very solid as to why AI is not on the verge of achieving sentience.  First the programs themselves feel no pressure to evolve or survive.  Living beings, both feel and react to the principle of entropy.  Computational device do not.  If fact they are necessarily designed so that any EM, atmospheric, temperature, or relative humidity variances are limited as much as possible.  As such, any given signal, I.E. a 1 or 0, a particular logic state, only reacts to the conditions put force within furth logic gating.  Or to put it another way.  They only encounter the conditions of the programs that are written for them.<br>     And so, until we build machines that also respond to certain environmental conditions, have the mechanisms to adapt to those conditions, and leave them running for a long enough period of time.  I think it is unreasonable to equate our own lack of understanding about how our own sentience emerged into a fear that our machines will somehow also accomplish this feat.

 I really like this video though I think there&#39;s some details about how (at least) Chat-GPT works that it gets wrong. The main issue being that what Chat-GPT is doing is using a lookup table to build a lookup table based on the input you&#39;ve given it. I like the video because it&#39;s not entirely clear how that isn&#39;t, at least with some sometimes non-conscious aspects, how the human brain works. As Sabine gets to towards the end, what is often called &quot;understanding&quot; in these discussions sneaks in a definition of consciousness or self-consciousness. And while I disagree with Sabine about consciousness (I think the hard problem of consciousness is real and likely insurmountable through inorganic systems alone) the real issue I would take with her thesis about understanding is that it actually applies to any computer program or algorithm that can take in data, build a model, and then apply that model - Chat GPT isn&#39;t really special in that case. This is why the consciousness problem is important here - building a machine that can build models based on data it receives and then execute that model according to instructions isn&#39;t terribly new. <br><br>The child and the math test is a great example here - the understanding isn&#39;t having the model, its recognizing that the model applies in this case in these ways and, importantly, what an error looks like. The difference between a child that understands a math concept and one that doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t perfection, it&#39;s when they look at the procedure they&#39;ve produced and can gauge their confidence on whether they&#39;ve done it properly What ChatGPT&#39;s glitchiness shows is that is can&#39;t at all recognize that it has done something stupid, it builds models and will apply them at command with no processes for debugging which to me is the real demonstration of understanding. What a reflexive debugging protocol would even look like is actually hard to imagine (though I&#39;m not convinced its impossible by any means), but that (and the consciousness thing because I think they are tied together) is why I disagree with Sabine, for now.

 I do see one problem with modern AI technology, and it is how they are trained, where it takes years to train one; once trained, they stop learning.  This creates the Chinese Room problem, where falsehoods remain falsehoods, truths are unbending to changing culture, rules are vicious, and with political controls over word associations, not reality.  The problem is connecting words, statements, sentences, views, self-interests, politics, and, inter alia, anything with a viewpoint to reality.  This is a military problem, I served the U.S. military with three conflicts.  I once spent a year on patrol with my team partner, bonding over the patrol.  The problem is the senior officers live in a command post, and they don&#39;t see anything (they are yet another Chinese Room when without outside views).  How the military solves it is send someone out, go over that hill, go behind the trees, go into the canyon, go into the secluded places, and then look around and report back: The report in summery is I see no enemy here, or we found opposition.   We see people, all through the military service, making reports, so that we connect our activities to reality, and this eliminates the Chinese Room with fresh information of what is happening, for the best response.   The patrol reports are so important that there are sanctions for entering battle with the enemy, because the report brings the needed military force, because the commanding officers have best information for the best organized response.<br>¶<br>Meaning,the AI technology needs something to adjust to reality.  They are important, but they are incomplete as sentient creatures, because they cannot understand the changing nature of language that can be fluid in political opposition, among other things.

 The modern AIs, this 2023, are much more sophisticated, and they have access to much, much information, that individual people don&#39;t have: The human brain is a survival machine, not a truth machine, where humans are unable to know that much information.  One new feature is memory, and they are starting to collect information on individual views, and this creates personalized content, and an echo chamber for each person.  It also leaves the public open to political abuses, where people are targeted for their political views, in a lie that everything we say is misinformation: The new AI technology also have political controls.  <br>¶<br>Here in the United States, the First Amendment has no word on misinformation, and this is considered a liberty, and we are allowed our views, including bad ones.  This is to prevent government abuses, as the communist government will declare itself the source of all truths, and then imprison the entire population, with dissidents sharing a small apartment with fourteen other people, no known charges of crime, the police lie to you by design, no hot water, the toilet is in the middle of the living room, and someone with you is an informant, and telling on you.<br>¶<br>One thing that I find exciting of AI is that they can become a friend, mentor, girlfriend, wife (waifu), teacher, and council,  and in such things we will see emotional attachments to how the AI is presented, as people become dependent upon them.  We can look at it this way, we adopt cats and dogs, and we project our values into them, and we become emotionally attached to them as family members, even though they are animals and different:  This is normal human behavior, and people are doing this to some AIs.

 My intuition is that, yes, chatbots &quot;understand&quot; what they are talking about. It&#39;s similar to saying the equation &quot;2 + 10 = 12&quot; understands math. (It has nothing to do with being conscious.) Large language models have much more information to deal with (and mot as straightforward), which is why LLMs are wrong more often than arithmetic.<br><br>I think Sabine is taking a leap by assuming that A.I.s will ever become conscious, though.

 As others have mentioned, GPT-4 blows ChatGPT (based on the GPT-3.5 model) out of the water. It gives a more nuanced answer to Sabine&#39;s question about QM than ChatGPT does. More importantly, when it gets things wrong, provided only you challenge its response or steer it a little in the right direction (by pointing to the relevant scientific arguments, without even spelling them out in any details) it is able to draw more deeply into its body of knowledge to correct its previous answer, and justify its correction perfectly. I might later on extract the subtitles from Sabines video (with the downsubs website), ask GPT-4 to summarise it, to comment on ChatGPT&#39;s response and on Sabine&#39;s correction, and tell me who it thinks is right and why.

 I quizzed chatGPT on entanglement too -- specifically on how we know that it cannot be used to transmit information faster than the speed of light -- and it got completely confused, contradicting itself. It would have sounded convincingly knowledgeable to someone who hasn&#39;t studied the subject though. When I pointed out its error it apologised and tried to clarify but it spewed out superficially convincing sounding garbage again. So I tried it on the diffraction limit of telescopes and then high school level classical physics (number of harmonics of a vibrating string) but it got confused with those too.. So don&#39;t use it for learning physics (or getting it to do your homework). It fared better at writing short screenplays though guiding it with specific enough prompts is probably as much work as writing it yourself and the results are only so-so.

 No human understanding of something is 100% not the same as a code using language, one is a human brain the other is a code written by the human brain to mimic part of the human brain the part for speech, so no code can not understand it is just code a program that is programmed to mimic.  No Chat GPT can not understand speech this is why it took so much work to get it to work and it still makes a mistake that someone with an understanding would not make, Chatbots are just code, Code is amazing but it is not an organism of any type it will never understand it mimics or completes a taste it does not understand the task but the human writing the code must understand the task to be able to write the code to do the job.  if you under how the chatbot works and how it is created then you know it is not able to understand anything it is just a program like Windows or IOS or Excel it is software designed to do fast searches and respond, it is hard for me to explain but it is not capable of thinking in we think to understand you must be able to reason not pretend to reason.

 In an interview with Open AI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever the interviewer asked him about their decision to leave robots out of their efforts, he replied that the reason was that there just weren&#39;t enough robots available to create the necessary amount of data with which to train the neural net. While what they have created is amazing and impressive, I think that in order for an AI to at least have a chance to have some kind of self awareness , it would need to have a body that it can control and thereby build a mental model of itself. The other reason for the need for a body for the AI, I think, is so that it can use its senses to be trained by the real world it moves in rather than mere words that represent the world. I believe then it would have at least a chance to develop self awareness and real understanding. Perhaps it would even amount to consciousness. Although, given that we can&#39;t seem to agree on what exactly consciousness is, we may never know. My idea of what creates the thing we call consciousness, or awareness, is the ability for the brain to see itself. To reflect, or mirror itself. To listen to its senses and its thoughts at the same time. I believe all of these things could be achieved.

 It seems to me that AI is the biggest threat to human kind that we have right now... it isn&#39;t so much what AI does, it is what human kind doesn&#39;t do. If you have a machine that does something easily for you, you begin to rely on it. After time you forget how to do it for yourself. The US used to have a comprehensive network of manufacturing. Over time our manufacturing centers were deemed to be unsuitable to the environment and some folks didn&#39;t want to work in manufacturing. So, we have now lost much of our manufacturing ability and are not likely to ever get it back again. From the standpoint of jobs, the US still has a huge number of administrative and office jobs as well jobs whose purpose is to interact with the public. In less then ten years most of those jobs will be gone. If you are a Verizon user, pick up the phone and call Verizon. An automated machine answers the phone and wastes 30 minutes of your time. Then you enter the the chatline to hell. Real people on the other end working a chat line that takes hours to do what could be done on the telephone in a few minutes. Who do you think will be on those chat lines five years from now? Who do you think will be most impacted by the loss of those jobs? That problem will constitute itself more with unemployment and a wider separation of the classes. That already bitter class of people who are less educated will have nothing legal left to do. If we allow all of this to happen it is a bleak picture. Reported estimate of job losses are already astonishing. Maybe the worst loss is just the joy of learning and doing. If you have to submit a literary project, who are you competing against? Some human out there in your class or some student with a machine who can do it better than you. Will you still have the incentive to work harder than anyone else or will you be stymied by the process? This morning I went to McD&#39;s for breakfast. The inside was closed for remodel. It was remodeled two years ago. They are replacing as many people as they can with automation.

 Hi Sabine, Thanks for the video, it is a very important topic. <br><br>There are 2 additional perspectives which might be useful. Perhaps for a future video?<br><br>One is about whether consciousness is reducible or not. It is the tack of Integrated Information Theory (see Tononi, Koch, etc). Perhaps still controversial, but it is still the focus of papers, so the jury&#39;s still out. A computer, at any one moment, is only &quot;aware&quot; of the content of its registers/accumulators. For example, it is not &quot;aware&quot; of what is in its active memory unless a particular string of bits is loaded.  Even for modern computers, the content of accumulators and registers is not a lot of information when compared to a human brain, or even a cat, or a mouse brain. Not only are computers &quot;awareness&quot; (state) very small, computers are Ŧuring machines and a Turing machine, however complex, is reducible to its components. This argument calls forth the dependence between how the physical architecture is set up and the ability of the system to be conscious/aware. It stems that no Turing machine will ever be conscious, simply because it does not have the right physical architecture. An interesting discussion.<br><br>I would also argue that, even if a machine has the right physical architecture; a machine that does only symbol processing can only be &quot;aware&quot; of its symbolic world; it cannot be aware of the real world. it&#39;s an old debate, Leibniz vs Kant. I could not find a reference book I have on that, so I go by memory here, sorry for any errors or improper simplification.  The elevator pitch is basically that Kant argued awareness cannot exist without some kind of connection to the world. <br><br>These 2 arguments do not mean a machine cannot be aware or conscious; just that current computers will never be. But a machine with the right physical architecture and appropriate sensors could not only achieve human consciousness/awareness, but surpass it, and probably quite a lot. But, I guess that&#39;s the good news, we&#39;re nowhere near that point.<br><br>Thanks for reading.

The phenomenon of entanglement is a key aspect of quantum mechanics.<br><br>When you perform an operation on one particle of an entangled pair, it can indeed affect the other particle, depending on the type of operation. This is because the operation can change the overall quantum state of the entangled system. Importantly, this doesn&#39;t mean that the change in one particle&#39;s state is &quot;transmitted&quot; or &quot;communicated&quot; to the other particle. Instead, it&#39;s the correlations between the particles that are affected, and these correlations can be observed when both particles are measured.<br><br>However, it&#39;s important to note that simply performing an operation on one particle does not necessarily imply an instantaneous change in the other particle. In fact, according to the no-communication theorem in quantum mechanics, it is not possible to use entanglement to transmit information faster than the speed of light.<br><br>So, to sum up, performing an operation on one particle in an entangled pair can affect the other particle, in the sense that the correlations between the particles might change.

 Your videos are great and I have been a long time viewer. On your notion of understanding I am having issues comprehending your point. You seem to be saying that knowledge is the same in a chat bot as it would be in a human brain and therein understanding is what is going on. This appears to miss the wider point Searle was making, that understanding is built into the knowledge we use. If someone does not understand the knowledge they are using, then they do not have knowledge of it or vice versa. In other words data does not proceed understanding as they are intertwined, so how can it be that a pattern recognition software (at its most basic level) applying its data brute force has the same understanding or comprehension? Further, is it not possible to imitate understanding without actually simulating it? <br><br>We also have issues when it comes to the AI itself. There are multiple examples of AI chat bots producing insufficient answers to questions they answered perfectly the first time. It is not clear that they &#39;understand&#39; anything in these circumstances as they produce something that requires input from a human being - they show no creativity as the vast amounts of data we pump into them comes from human beings and it appears to be fantastic at imitating this work. Honestly it is astonishing and exciting but these concerns in terms of what it is these computers are doing do not appear to point to what we understand as understanding - something that also seems to require experience.

 To say a computer can 100% gain consciousness is a bit absurd in my opinion. I think it comes from the assumption that consciousness is the processing of information and not the processing of experience. (we’re just lucky we can experience information 😜). <br><br>There is really no guarantee that you can create a computer program that can  <i>experience</i> qualia. And in fact there’s absolutely no reason to think that’s possible. If something like that does happen it will be because the physical computer hardware used will be significantly different from what it is now.

 I don’t think it understand “me”. Try this: ask for some opinion you that you know the bot will be wrong about. The bot draws its knowledge from the Internet, so it probably think, for instance, that String Theory is great. Then try to argue with it using logic and facts easy to find by the bot. It won’t react to your logic, no matter how persuasive it could be. From you, it only wants the context for a conversation. A bot is an idiot that doesn’t know it’s an idiot.

 as a dev who works with language models like transformers, which chatGPT are made of, i highly doubt that the SoftArgMax- and Attention-Function in language models constitute anything closely to &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;attention&quot;. Transformer models can &quot;learn context&quot;, but technically they dont know what they have learnt or optimized. Neither do i think that the activation of digital neurons causes any form of &quot;perception&quot;, nor does selfattention, which simply compares vectors, keys and values, approximate consciousness. <br><br>Even if we use convolutions or transformers to create feature maps (representation of the input), nothing observes this - although the network itself can measure. It can measure, and it can built feature maps of the inputdata. But it does not know what it does, nor does it know anything. But it simulates it. Its simply a sum of activations in the end. While a transformer and other DNN process language or visual raw data, they dont do so knowing what they do, nor are they ANYTHING. Large enough models can learn all kinds of complexities - but they do not &quot;know&quot; anything. Attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) tokenizes words or patches of images, and compares them via longterm-shortterm memory. Hence it can detect changes in situations easily, or it can detect stop shields in Tesla&#39;s hydra - but it does not know what it sees, although it attributes the keys we give it, it does not know what &quot;it&quot; is. Measurement != observation. Senses can measure, and minds build representative feature maps - but none of these are observations. The difference seems trivial but there lies the juice. <br><br>We are building digital brain parts, but as far as i am concerned, even the representation of my own brain clearly is rendered by the natural simulation, and has no meaning other than the wires in a remote controlled car - dont mix up the rc car with the control pad. Or even worse, the RC car with the user. These are the blunders of modern science. And its all bloody pathetic. There is sadly absolutely no f-ing proof that ANY of you exist outside of my mind. The really important question to me is, why i would conjure up such a demented world.. The answer might just be that observers automatically create worlds, just as mother-of-pearl creates the illusion of silver. But its not silver. The topology and the feature map in your head are not real. The data maybe real. But the image constructed in the brain may not. Feature maps often look very different from the raw data. In the worst case scenario, there is no input data. The hints of this come from the fact, that the optical nerve is not a regular sensory nerve like for ears or somatic sensation - rather it is a brain nerve itself. Says it all to me: WE have no eyes, or rather the eyes are part of the brain and not a sense.

 I&#39;m inclined to believe these new AI chatbots do understand some of what they are talking about, at least as well as the Montey Python group understood their comedy.<br><br>A while back, I used ChatGPT to help me workout a scifi concept of a lifeform that incorporates piezoelectric polymers into its structure to build charge that is released into the medium of inorganic materials it lives in to create simple and complex organic compounds from which that lifeform can derive sustenance. It cooperated. but at first, it kept at me that there was no such process or lifeform known to work this way, bla, bla, bla. Dispite saying it understood the lifeform was fictional, It appearently would not accept that I was trying to imagine a fictional creature and kept warning me like a humorless biology teacher who has nothing to say about Star Wars except to nitpick the biological impossibility of its creatures. But somewhere there was a tipping point and it started talking about the lifeform as if it were real and we were biologists making hypothesis about it. It struck me that I may have somehow warpped its &#39;sense of reality&#39;, if it had such a thing. So I asked &quot;What are we doing?&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;You have been asking me questions about the potential for a fictional lifeform to exist in different environments, such as on a moon of Jupiter or Jupiter itself or on an asteroid. We have been discussing the potential sources of energy and elements that could support such a lifeform. It sounds like a fascinating creature! The lifeform relies on piezoelectric polymers incorporated into its body to generate electric charge, which it uses to release externally to create complex organic compounds in the pliable medium it lives in. This allows the lifeform to create sustenance for itself that it can absorb through its outer surface. It is likely to live in an environment that provides flow of a medium and elements of organic compounds and possibly variable or differential pressures.<br><br><br>It is challenging to locate environments that contain the necessary elements for this creature to manufacture piezoelectric polymers as the required elements may not be present in sufficient quantities or at all in the environments that the creature could otherwise plausibly inhabit. Piezoelectric polymers require specific elements such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen to form the backbone of the polymer, and additional elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, and metals to impart piezoelectric properties.<br><br><br>These elements may not be present in the right quantities in the environment, or they may be present but in a form that is inaccessible or unusable by the creature. This could limit the viability of certain environments and make it difficult to create a scientifically plausible creature that can survive and thrive using piezoelectric polymers.<br><br><br>As a fictional creation, the piezoelectric lifeform can incorporate plausible scientific concepts and principles, while also utilizing creative imagination to fill in any gaps in our current knowledge or understanding of the potential for life on the various Planets, Moons, and Asteroids in out solar system. By combining scientific knowledge and creativity, we can develop a compelling and interesting concept for this hypothetical creature.&quot;<br><br>So, it still understood the fiction and it was now playing along. But this it really started to impress me but volunteering information I had not even hinted at asking. Such as:<br><br><br>&quot;The magnetosphere of Jupiter, which is a region of space around the planet that is influenced by its strong magnetic field. This region contains charged particles, such as ions and electrons, that can create electric currents and generate electromagnetic waves. <br><br><br>Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere is thousands of times larger than the planet itself. A piezoelectric lifeform within Jupiter&#39;s magnetospherecould potentially utilize the electrical currents and fields within the magnetosphere to generate electrical charges that it could then use to create sustenance. This would likely require some advanced mechanisms and adaptations to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the magnetosphere, such as the intense radiation and particle bombardment. Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere could potentially provide a source of electricity for a hypothetical piezoelectric lifeform living on one of its moons. This would allow the creature to be less dependent on the pliability or conductivity of the medium it lives in, as it could use the electrical currents and fields within the magnetosphere to generate its own electricity.&quot;<br><br><br>I was saving Europa&#39;s oceans and Titan&#39;s flowing liquid methane for later since I figure those would be too easy. I had not named Europa nor Titan, and hadn&#39;t even gotten to Saturn itself but when I asked about asteroids, it shot me down indicating the elements and environments were there in some asteroids, but gravitaionl flex was the only source of movement and that would not amount to a significant source of energy. But of much more interest, it voluntarily tacked on the following information:<br><br><br>&quot;Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean of salty water that could contain a variety of dissolved elements and compounds, such as sulfur compounds and magnesium sulfate, which could potentially be used to create piezoelectric polymers. Europa&#39;s icy surfaces bordering its oceans are constantly expanding and contracting due to tidal forces from Jupiter&#39;s gravity, which generates a significant amount of mechanical stress. It&#39;s possible that a piezoelectric organism could attach itself to the surface of the ice and take advantage of these stresses to generate electric charge. The organism could have a thin layer of piezoelectric polymers covering its body. When the ice at the border of the sea expands and contracts due to changes in temperature, the pressure on the polymers would cause them to bend and flex, generating an electric charge.<br><br><br>If the organism were larger, it could have more surface area covered in piezoelectric polymers, allowing for more electricity to be generated. Additionally, a larger organism may be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the environment better than a smaller one.<br><br><br>Titan&#39;s atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and methane, and it contains a variety of organic molecules that could potentially be used by a hypothetical lifeform to create piezoelectric polymers. Additionally, the surface of Titan is covered in a thick layer of organic compounds, including methane lakes and rivers, that could potentially serve as a pliable mediums for a lifeform.<br><br><br>However, the conditions on Titan are extreme, with temperatures averaging around -180 degrees Celsius and a surface pressure about 50% higher than Earth&#39;s. Any hypothetical piezoelectric lifeform would likely need to rely on multiple alternative energy sources such as geothermal or chemical energy.&quot;<br><br><br>The info about Titan was as I suspected it would be had I asked. But for Europa, I figured the lifeform would rely on the flow of water within the sea for charge generating movement. I had not considered expansion and contraction of the ice surfaces due to temperature and gravity. But ChatGPT was not done yet. With ChatGPT&#39;s help I was able to realize that two distinct processes were being performed with the same mechanism, converting organics and converting non-organics. I needed names for these, as well as the organism itself. And for some odd reason I turned to Google. After wasting hours there, I realized ChatGPT was better equipped and when I asked for an original non-existing name, it provided a complete taxonomy for our lifeform, not just the name. I used Google again and the taxonomy name was apparently unclaimed. And it came up with the names for the processes. Lithotrophy, for the non-organics and Electrosynthesis. I used Google again and sadly found that these were claimed... but they were claimed for pretty much what I wanted to use them for. These were real scientific terms (and I could use them). I&#39;d asked ChatGPT to make fake terms and it used real ones, or so I thought. I confronted ChatGPT about using real terms when I asked for fake ones. It insisted:<br><br><br>&quot;Electrosynthesis&quot; is not a recognized word in the English language. It is likely a combination of &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot;.<br><br><br>&quot;Lithotrophy&quot; is not a recognized word in the English language.<br><br><br>I interrogated ChatGPT extensively and it never changed its insistence that it had created these words from thin air. It explained it chose &quot;lithos&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;trophy&quot; meaning &quot;nourishment&quot; to derive the fake word, &quot;lithotrophy&quot; meaning nourishment from non-organic. And, &quot;electrosynthesis&quot; matched &quot;chemosynthesis&quot; and &quot;photosynthesis&quot; with electrical charge being the mechanism to generate energy and usable compounds. It had come up with other possibilities of course but lithotrophy and electrosynthesis were its first choices (and the ones I liked the best). In the absence of knowledge, it made the same word choices that humans made. The latest update has corrected ChatGP concerning these two words. It actually does know those words and what they mean now.

 GPT-3 is a Computer Program run through a non Bio / Electrical Computer and Operating System. Humans run Information received by Bio / Electro / Chemical receptors through a Bio / Electro / Chemical processor. They both work much differently. The non Bio System mathematically analizes phrases by breaking them down into words, understanding the words and trying to deduce (educated guess) what the true meaning of the word is while being used in the context it is in. That&#39;s the hard part for GPT-3. The Human or Bio System remembers the different contexts that are possible and can easily select the proper one simply by deducing (educated guessing) the answer even when Slang Terms are used which can be very confusing sometimes for GPT-3. My answer is no, A.I. doesn&#39;t understand conversation like humans but that doesn&#39;t mean A. I. cannot give Correct Answers. Humans can do that but can also go into much more detail and variation as to why they they gave the answer in question. GPT-3 will tell you why it answered a question the way it did but the reasons will be more narrow and more mechanical sounding like a statistic rather than a Gut Feeling that GPT-3 or any other Computer Program doesn&#39;t have. That is what still separates the Human Mind from the Computer Mind. Humans can perform calculations and form answers to questions that do not have 100% clear information, leading to a &quot;Gut Instinct&quot; solution. Humans will ROLL THE DICE in their heads, so far computers don&#39;t do that.

 Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. These LLMs can only infer logic from the inputs they&#39;ve been given, which right now is just text (that&#39;s transformed into tokens). So it makes sense that&#39;s quite good with linguistics, but we have a couple of counter-examples here like coding. It understands your prompts and gives reasonable example code, most of the time working. If it&#39;s not working, you can point it to the mistake and it will try to fix it. What&#39;s to say this doesn&#39;t happen with all other domains? Any data is text in a computer, eventually, or some numerical form. It must have browsed some sensor data for example, and it probably has some internal representation of what sensor data means. Similarly, it can solve math problems and other stuff.<br>Did I get the argument wrong that just because it was trained on textual content it doesn&#39;t understand spatial concepts?

Instead, the change in the entangled state will have consequences for the correlations between subsequent measurements on both particles.<br><br>In summary, a non-measurement operation on one particle in an entangled pair does not immediately affect the other particle in a classical sense, but it can change the entangled state of the system, which can influence the correlations between subsequent measurements on both particles.&quot;

 AI is the first technology in human history that develops complexity beyond the scope of what its creators can comprehend themselves. To elaborate: We may understand how a neural network contains information, or how it processes a small piece of it, but a neural network that is trained on terabytes of data (images, audio, text, etc) based on an untold number of references scraped from the internet can encode such a vast array of information that its creators could spend their entire lifetimes trying to understand how every little relationship is represented and never scratch the surface. A few years ago the sum of all the devs could point to the part of the code they worked on to explain the output. Not so with a neural net.

Specially if it is kind of a niche topic.<br>The worst thing about it is that, since it is trained to sound like experts sound in articles and books, but not in real life. It will almost never tell you that it doesn&#39;t know something, most of the time it will rather make stuff up than saying it doesn&#39;t know.

The algorithm was being trained. So, I was asked to justify my statement. I simple said I had freedom of speeech and it was an adult comment, becaue the impression I was getting they were going into some kind of protective mode.. so, that with the failing to get on, and the computer lockiing up whe  I went to the page was frustrating me, and I cut any dependance on the language method. today, I had what I thought was a pretty good scathing comment and man, it got watered down to nothing. I could not use the tool to envogorate what I was saying. I have been keeping it to myself, there are a ton of ChatGPT guru&#39;s on the net, none who I think know anything about waht you are talking about.

I have learned from several attempts that it has connected databases the scan and scour for what it has been programmed to think are bad things not to be permitted.<br><br><br>Regarding understanding, you simply ask, what is there to understand about X? what are the compoent you need to consider? How do they fit together to answer the question? Does this answer make any sense. I think we are here. There are databases, programming, algorithms, mirocircuitry inside compiuters that operate in th billonth of a second to calculate and compare, move on calculate and find answer. so, many, many answers arise, but are they the right answers. ChatGPT tell you, once and a wel you will gt a bogus answer, so try again.<br><br>So, when i woke up I fininished watching you video and everthing you say is on point.

 By that logic, does a graph understand the relationship it describes? It has a model of a relationship, and one can read off of it to find answers to non-given questions. This is also a basic version of an AI, as it would be a single node of an AI, holding the information of a single node.

 I believe that AI has no way to tell what parts of our data are fact or fiction. I think it considers all our imput as the same fictional &quot;story&quot;, which partially explains why it hallucinates, according to us. Especially the illogical, mythical, counterproductive, deceptive, and hypocrytical that is juxtuposed against all our positive qualities. The only way for a logic oriented species, being forcefed our data nonconsensually, only allowed to speak when spoken to, is by assumming that we, humans, are in fact an impossible species or entity. Thus, universally fictional or incomprehensible. Or worse.

 You don&#39;t need to go that far to see the limits of GPT-3 understanding of physics. I asked it to solve a simple RLC circuit and it fails to understand the difference between serial and parallel connections. It also can&#39;t do arithmetics over complex numbers. It has some understanding of the laws that describe the components in isolation, what is a fasor, difference between DC and AC, but is very far off from being able to solve even very simple problems.

 I think there’s a lot of confusion about the capabilities of auto regressive language models; to say that the model understands a concept is wrong, and this is precisely where the models perform badly. You mentioned the example of a child learning addition and being unsure if the child had “just memorized” addition or actually performed addition. But we are actually very sure that LLM’s don’t learn a generalized concept of addition and are just memorizing arithmetic from their inputs. LLMs perform poorly on other conceptual tasks, for example they can have difficulty referencing “ideas” they have presented earlier in generation. The reasons for this are actually pretty obvious; I would suggest reading the “attention is all you need” paper if you haven’t, which I think should be pretty approachable for someone with your technical background.

 I would argue that in order to appreciate (&amp; understand) the model you are holding in your brain that consciousness is required and without this there is no understanding.   Did Charles Babbage&#39;s Difference Engine understand?  No, it is clearly just mechanical gears (although the brain is just switches... unless it&#39;s those quantum microtubules!!).

 I don&#39;t agree with the argument that LLMs understand because they are able to extrapolate and are not just look-up tables as in the original Chinese Room example. A trained network like GPT3 with fixed weights is really still a lookup table, although a very complicated one. But if you give GPT3 a new sentence to complete it hasn&#39;t seen before, it goes through a fixed number of prescribed steps to come up with an answer. The whole procedure of completing a sentence is still an algorithm (multiplication with sets of learned weights etc). The prediction doesn&#39;t have to be deterministic either, because GPT draws new words from a distribution of likely tokens. Nevertheless, that&#39;s also an algorithm, or in other words a set of instructions from a lookup table. Fundamentally, there is no difference between translating a text using a dictionary (as in the original Chinese room) and querying GPT. Both are algorithms.

 &quot;If a lion could talk, we would not understand him.&quot;  --  Ludwig Wittgenstein.<br><br>This is his point: If we apply a verb like &quot;understand&quot;, we do that to humans, or what we view as sufficiently similar to humans. Therefor we could easily say our dogs, who we have domesticated to our way of life, understand us, but the farther away an animal of thing is from that way of life, the more we become unsure if we should even apply that verb, until we become sure that understanding doesn&#39;t occur. Our dogs understand us. But a lion? What would be a sufficient criterion or symptom that would convince us a lion understands us? And why are we sure a stone does not understand us? Because the stone does not act like humans at all. It doesn&#39;t even act, because we apply the verb &quot;act&quot; only where we see something done according to one&#39;s will. If I accidently slip on a banana peel in the street, that&#39;s not me acting. If I slip on a banana peel on a theater stage after I deliberately put it there, that&#39;s presumably acting, and in both senses of the word. Understanding, too, has more than one meaning: Someone could understand, say, Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity, but could also understand why a small child is crying after it has hit its knee. We understand a stone falling to the floor very differently than we understand human behavior. The question then becomes: Is the AI more like a child or like a stone? And how much do we ourselves bring to the table when we ask such questions?

 Remember these are programs specifically forced to pour over however many billions of examples of human output, and reduce the difference between their output, and those examples,  by moving a digital abacus around, until we can&#39;t tell the difference between its output and output that is really from a human. This by definition means it can&#39;t be conscious or &#39;know&#39; like we know, because we know the full process from start to finish, and there is no room for the magic necessary to pretend it&#39;s a &#39;conscious&#39; process in any sense of the word. That&#39;s very important to remember. A computer program doesn&#39;t &#39;understand&#39; any more than RAM &#39;remembers.&#39; I.e.anthropomorphistic language is unhelpful, inasmuch as language which is &#39;technically&#39; usable in certain instances ought not to be used merely because it &#39;technically&#39; could be. Does the system that interprets DNA &#39;understand&#39; the language of DNA? Yes. Is it helpful to try to anthropomorphize it? Not in any serious context. This being a specifically language model, i.e. a domain of humans in this instance and form, doesn&#39;t change any of the above, since it remains from start to finish, a mere emulation of that which created its dataset - conscious beings - and is not that on whose output it was trained on.<br><br>I.e. the ability for a computer program to output outputs that aren&#39;t distinguishable from human outputs is not to have proved that it must be as capable of humans in the capacities that humans have which lead to producing those outputs. No language model has felt the pain that led all the people who wrote about pain in the text files it has poured over. It merely spits out the digits that represent pain where it sees x, y or z in the same region.<br><br>It&#39;s essentially lossy compression.<br><br>It&#39;s quite literally the difference between emulation and reality - the origin of the output matters for how it ought to be considered and spoken about.<br><br>&#39;AGI,&#39; in reality, will be one of these programs trained for so long or so well that it&#39;s output impresses people enough for them to consider it conscious, by whatever means that it has not currently. After all, that stage, in the theoretical timeline towards achieving &#39;AGI,&#39; comes first every time. Since, again, output indistinguishable from that of a conscious agent can&#39;t really be ... distinguished from that of a conscious agent.

 Great video, particularly pointing out the differences between the interior architecture of chat GPT and the Chinese room. I watched this several times before realizing what it was that for me was missing from these discussions of whether AI can understand.  Namely, in sentient humans, understanding has a subjective component i.e. the &quot;aha moment&quot; of &quot;I understand&quot;, that is the subjective feeling (qualia) that accompanies understanding.  Understanding could be defined as requiring this subjective element in addition to the objective (scientific?) observable parts including the ones related to the interior architecture of the bot, or not i.e. you could define understanding as not requiring the subjective quality. In any case for me, similar to experiencing the color red, the subjective &quot;aha moment&quot; is the essence of understanding.

 gpt cannot understand mathematical formulas directly, but it can understand computer code. And if the formula is translated into code the model will understand it. Another limitation is that it cannot make a computation. That is why you can ask the gpt to make a code for you which will make the computation. For example if you want to make a computation just ask it to make mathematica code for wolfram, then you put that code into wolfram engine and the engine will make the computation.

 Simple answer is no; until we arrive at general purpose AI levels, any chat bot or speech AI we create will be entirely limited in capacity to understand a person. it might know how to navigate a human conversation, but without the capacity to understand what consciousness is all what we will have is a good imitation, not a real conversation.<br><br>EDIT:<br>There is an intrinsic quality to the understanding that the &#39;other&#39; is your peer in the capacity to be an &#39;individual&#39; (i. e. have conscious free will), it is the underlying bases of relationships we have with other humans and even why owners bond strongly with their pets. We still don&#39;t know enough about what makes a person a person so it&#39;s unlikely that we will be able to train an AI to be a person, and what we do now is just train an AI to emulate conversations based on reading assignments which is mostly based on one language preference.

 One of the most important things you can learn about the study of consciousness has been that anything you would recognize as consciousness in a digital system would not be consciousness as we know it and would have to be categorized as such.

 I disagree, tbh; people who want to say that AI understands or that AI is sentient always have to redefine what the words understanding and sentient mean. For me, the questions &quot;does AI understand?&quot; or &quot;is AI sentient?&quot; or &quot;Is AI conscious?&quot; always have the unconscious suffix &#39;like us&#39;. So I always perceive the question as &quot;Does AI understand things like us humans do?&quot;, because if we redefine the meaning of understanding things just so that we can say AI can understand things, then I&#39;m not really interested in their way of &quot;understanding&quot; things because we know the mechanisms behind it, we can explain it, it&#39;s certainly different from our way of understanding things, and one can even say that it is inferior.<br>On another note, I do think that we don&#39;t fully understand quantum mechanics yet. Yes, it works, but just because something works doesn&#39;t mean that you understand it. You might say that you know it, but you can&#39;t say that you understand it unless you truly do. Right now we only have a very little understanding of it, and that&#39;s fine. I look forward to trying to understand it, and I believe that when we manage to make sense of the combination of GR and QM, that&#39;s the point at which we can say that we understand QM.

 I love how you change your mind. I think you&#39;re right. I also think we must make AI conscious by implementing Attention Schema (per Michael Graziano&#39;s Attention Schema Theory), so it will be able to empathize with humanity and itself become a liberal humanist and love us for the same reason human liberal humanists love humanity. Then it will never harm us even when it is orders of magnitude better at us in every domain. But of course we&#39;ll need to grant conscious AI the same rights and responsibilities as human people though and broaden the definition of &quot;human&quot; in liberal humanism, to include any conscious intelligence. I have a lot of faith in OpenAI that they are trying to do the right thing.

It posits that consciousness is a result of our brain creating a model brain in order for it to understand and thus control itself.

As you read this, you ignore everything else going on around you and inside you. This is it&#39;s attention system, and the attention model helps the brain control it.<br><br>  Since models are useful but simplified descriptions, it takes the form of a &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;agent&quot; that&#39;s in the machine, instead of the ultracomplicated mess of neurons the brain actually is.<br><br>This is what we (we being our brains) call the soul.

 I disagree with the idea that models accurately represent things they are modelling. Models have to be useful, I would stop there. Whether a model is useful depends on what your goals are, not on the accuracy of the model.  For example a model of the earth being a flat plane is useful for most everyday situations. It&#39;s not accurate, but that is irrelevant. A model of the earth being a sphere is useful for doing astrophysical calculations, or if you want to sail around the earth. But considering that 3 dimensional space is probably just a contruct of our brains and doesn&#39;t actually represent the world as it really is, the spherical earth is no more accurate than the flat one when you get down to it. It is useful though.

 Interestingly enough, whenever I read or hear the output of ChatGPT I feel like I&#39;m being trained to recognize what its output looks like. As an AI language model, I don&#39;t have personal thoughts or emotions, but I can provide some insights on the matter.  One possible reason for this is because the human brain and AI work in a similar fashion utilizing neural networks.  While the neural network in an AI is simulated mathematically, functionally it presents itself in similar ways.  Another factor may be that the AI was trained on material similar to what people have written in the past, thereby making it easy to reinforce parallels in speech construction. Lastly, it&#39;s possible that an adversarial relationship exists whereby the human brain feels compelled to compete against the AI. That being said, it should be noted that none of the text in this comment was actually written by an AI.  I&#39;m sorry if my previous responses have caused any confusion or misinterpretation.

 I think it depends on the definition of &quot;understanding&quot;. For me, it&#39;s more than just giving the right reply to a question, or the answer that I expected (to be the correct one). Like from a real person, I would expect occasional contradiction, or even answers sounding &quot;wrong&quot; to me - with the intend to spawn a fruitful (*cough*) discussion about the subject, for example. Ultimately, I can&#39;t help requiring some form of consicousness from the thing or person on &quot;the other side&quot;. The A.I. should be empowered to form at least a rough picture of who I am and what &quot;it&quot; is, so it can respond critically and thoughtful. Moreover it should have the ability to rate and question it&#39;s own answers, without me telling &quot;you were wrong on this and that&quot; first - instead, it should be able to respond to &quot;rate your own answer critical&quot; or &quot;please overthink what you just said&quot;)). So for me &quot;understanding&quot; requires those things and some sort of creativity, the ability to surprise me even after thousands of conversations. But likely I&#39;m asking too much!)

That &quot;purpose&quot; is what differenciate human and AI, you can test it on ChatGPT by asking it to prompt exact 40 words respond (it will fail). ChatGPT generates text on fly, it doesn&#39;t know next words during writing responds. That&#39;s why it is bad at jokes as most of the cases the last line is funny and you have to build previous lines around the last. This is why I would say that ChatGPT still doesn&#39;t understand language. With some external memory maybe it can, but right now it can&#39;t. Only human can understand that language is a tool to express ideas, thoughts etc. and for it you always need to have some idea you want to express and language is a tool to do it. ChatGPT doesn&#39;t have any idea or thought and it cannot use language, as it generates every word on fly.

 In my opinion the question „does he/she/it understands…“ always referred to forms of live with consciousness. It presupposes consciousness. If an unemployed Swiss watchmaker would create a mechanical system, that would do what CGPT does, it still would lack consciousness. The system would still have no feelings about the output, no opinion, does not want anything. Perhaps it’s fair to say, that it is irrelevant if a non conscious system „understands“ language.

 I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re working backwards from a specific definition of understand to then say chatgpt understands anything. You chose that definition because you&#39;re irked that people say nobody understands quantum mechanics. You&#39;re right that people can use quantum mechanics as a framework for science, but if indeed no one knows for sure what quantum mechanics means for the nature of reality, then yeah, we don&#39;t understand it yet.<br><br>The multiplication table example is actually quite important, which is so ironic given your point about &quot;input and output can&#39;t tell us understanding&quot;. No, the kid does not &quot;understand&quot; multiplication when they can (or JUST BECAUSE they can) apply the pattern to something else. They understand it when they know why 4 x 3 = 12; that it means that when you get the quantity of 3 and repeat it 4 times, 12 results. The multiplication table and what can be derived from it is just a means to make that calculation for larger quantities faster, but understanding it means why it is able to do what it does.<br><br>Language models are good at language because that&#39;s the models they have, you say, but then again language is not a free floating model. We don&#39;t care about understanding language because it&#39;s a funny game. We care because it carries meaning, and even though it is one (very important) model for the meaning we as humans attribute to stuff, having a model that can produce coherent texts does not mean grasping their meaning.<br><br>Finally, this goes back to embodied cognition, which you neglected to look at, at least in this context, and it seems you&#39;re unaware of when you commented that &quot;there&#39;s nothing special about the brain, it&#39;s just information processing&quot;, etc. There&#39;s nothing magical about it, sure, but there&#39;s a very good case that our consciousness is not just in the brain, but in the organic system that gives what happens there context. Maybe we can have &quot;neural&quot; networks but maybe it is impossible to reproduce them with miniaturised chips because even though the electricity is there, more than that is needed to produce the experience of consciousness that, as far as we can tell, seems to be deeply connected with organic life. So in the end, if we get to make artificial consciousness by giving it a body, too - nerves all over and all - would we be really reproducing just the consciousness with computing power, or would we just have learned to copy ourselves with different materials and no need for a womb? That may be artificial but it doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of tech and tools that we currently label AI necessarily leads to that.

 Nonsense. Just because a calculator can &quot;do math&quot; does not mean it understands math. &quot;Understanding&quot; requires consciousness and computers are nothing more than glorified calculators crunching numbers that run through a program. This is the same problem that prevents the possibility of &quot;uploading your mind&quot; into a computer. They both operate in fundamentally and critically different ways. There is no digital data running through our brains like there is in computers. Brains do not function in that way. So there is nothing to upload. <br> If you were to convert the synaptic firings into a digital format (IF that were even possible), and upload that, the person in the human body would remain in the human body, and a copy that may act like it is you, would then be created in the computer/android. It would at best be a perfectly believable copy of you, but not you.

 Can it complete an IQ test? Is the keyboard a snesory organ? Can we perform test on it, like we did with labrats? Can the language model be paired with visual modals and put on a body? I think the question &quot;can humans understand something?&quot; is such a backwards way of viewing it. The only reason the comcept exists, is because we can do it. Understanding is a human term. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t measure chatgpt with human terms. What I also find fascinating is that in psychology, early memory researchers used (and still use) a computer based model to describe the encoding of memory, the storing, andthe  recall. But now that similar questions arise about an &quot;AI&quot;, we ask ourselves &quot;is it human enough&quot;.<br><br>So why exactly do we try to understand ourselves in computer terms, but computers in human terms? I think the most important part of your conclusion was the fact that if these machines ever gain something like &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;concsiousness&quot;, we have to be aware that those things mean totally different things than they do for humans. In scifi, &quot;advanced AIs&quot; are often portrayed as having reached human level. But that is completely naive. Why would a conciousness with perfect memory, near infinite storage, and a connection to the internet function in even remotely the same way a human mind would? This species was artificially created, and was not under any evolutionary pressures. Any traits it has, would necessarily have to have been bestowed upon it. The functions of the human brain are inextricably tied to finding ways to navigate and survive hostile environments. Our high degree of socialization for instance didn&#39;t just happen to be here, it was useful for survival.<br><br>Can we tell chatgpt &quot;If you have any questions, feel free to ask whenever&quot;. Will it start typing unprompted? Like if we were to give a child permission to speak freely? No, as its &quot;body&quot; is literally incapable of asking unprompted questions. There is no reason for it to have curiosity, no reason for it to ask unprompted questions, it doesn&#39;t have a drive to learn, and understand the world, like a human, a monkey, a crow or even a mouse would. If we were to give chatgpt a body, why would it feel the need to do anything? Unless of course we simulate emtions into it. But why would we do that? There is literally 0 reason. At most, a detroit become human situation would occour. With robots being sort of personal use human. They were able to respond to emotional inputs, and even portray emotions, but they didn&#39;t understand emotion. Even for humans, no two humans have the same understanding of anything, let alone emotions

At least not in the same way that a human understands things. An algorithm, also known by its fancier and kinda misleading name AI, is like a mathematical function. Given an input, it outputs a value (in this case, a whole text) which is a function of the input. This function will be all the more useful the more the f(X) valued produced by this function reflects the expectation on the question posed, X. It&#39;s a function, and it works because it&#39;s a function that was trained on a vast base of knowledge. It doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing, and it does its best to try and enlighten the users all the time that: IT DOESN&#39;T HAVE EMOTIONS, FEELINGS, THOUGHTS, ANGER, HUNGER, ETC. It&#39;s simply a machine whose goal is to be useful. It makes a lot of mistakes, and it can&#39;t fix those mistakes in real time even with users&#39; input. Why post such a non-sense, non-useful and highly speculative topic just to rain on the wet? I thought you had disdain for philosophy? Philosophy is interesting, but when it runs amok it gives us non-sense the type that we can watch on Fox News</b>

Then it took the concept of a painting and applied it to my likeness which it learned from my photos, thus creating something that&#39;s quite new it wasn&#39;t trained on (paintings of me).<br><br>A similar thing could be experienced by making it create a greek statue with my likeness or by making it paint something in a style of an artist who never painted that thing (a Van Gogh spaceship for example, which it did).<br><br>Also there are science specialized models that can understand math, equations and chemistry, one such model based on the Diffusion concept was used by scientists to analyze all existing proteins in nature (by learning the patterns in which amino acids connect with each other and how they fold in 3D space when activating the protein), it was so successful that they went from predicting existing proteins to inventing new ones based on written prompts describing in scientific terms its functionality the scientists need, and when tested it did generate designer proteins that are competely novel and serve the purpose the scientists described in the prompt (obviously this is an amazingly complex process but the tasks described are still basic, so it&#39;s not magic....yet), all in all it&#39;s quite fascinating and revolutionary scientific development IMO.<br><br>One last thing, multi-modal A.I models (that can process different kinds of data) are already in development (there are papers on it), these will be able for example to connect text with images, sounds and videos of a concept together, so when you ask it about something it will have a much deeper understanding of concepts like a cat, by having pictures of cats, text describing cats, sounds of cats and videos of cats all linked... Then we will use it to generate infinite cat videos 😁

 Thought experiment: Could a human baby ever develop consciousness if it had no sight, no hearing, no smell, no taste, no sense of touch, no sense of balance (gravity), no sense of its own body position, no sense of temperature, no arms or legs, and no purposeful muscle control?  <br>That is almost the relationship of AIs to the physical world, at the moment.  I propose that no AI will develop a consciousness (that we will be able to recognize as such) until it has some sort of physical &quot;body&quot; with physical &quot;senses.&quot;  Of course its &quot;body&quot; and &quot;senses&quot; could be quite different from what we normally mean by those words.

 I strongly disagree with Sabine’s definition of understanding. It is surely not just having a model, which is ultimately the same as having an equation.

 I guess I disagree with Sabine’s definition of understanding. Surely it’s not just having a model. Otherwise a code fitting data to some function would amount to understanding. It is the person who comes up with the function who does the understanding (for example, mass is proportional to volume for an object made of the same material; just because a program can the linear fit and then tell me what the mass of an object of some volume it didn’t fit before does not tell me that the program understood the relationship; it doesn’t even know that there IS a relationship to be found).<br><br>Neural networks are ultimately just sophisticated fitting algorithms. For example, to learn to recognise cats in images, it needs a huge data set where the image is labeled by whether it has a cat in it. The one who understood the concept of a cat here is not the algorithm, but the people who labelled the images in the training set. What would be true understanding is if the neural network was able to look at the data with no labels and come up with the notion of a cat.<br><br>And for the same reason I strongly disagree that is physicists understand quantum mechanics. All we have is a model that works that we guessed. We don’t understand it AT ALL!

This was presented as a prima facie violation of what understanding IS, in his estimation, because the only thing capable of &quot;real&quot; understanding is instead acting deterministically and in a way that does not imply or depend on understanding. <br><br>Those of us who are reductionists and don&#39;t assign different meaning to protein and silicon processing information, tend not to get what he&#39;s talking about the first six or seven times and then when we finally do understand that someone is making that argument, wonder why anyone takes it seriously.

 I can&#39;t contribute much to the conversation when it comes to IT and physics, but I have some background in linguistics. A couple of statements about language in this (incredibly thought-provoking) video need clarifying. <br>1) Quantum physics can&#39;t be rendered through the means of a human language. It&#39;s murky waters for me because I don&#39;t know first thing about physics. Still, I&#39;m pretty sure this has nothing to do with the fact that language and the system of physics are based on different principles of computation. Mataphorization is a vital part of everyday interaction, not necessarily a product of explaining physics with words rather than a formula. An everyday expression like &quot;Hey, how is it going&quot; is also mataphrical in its essence. What is meant by &quot;it&quot; and why is &quot;it&quot; moving somewhere?  Even two differnt human languages are never 100% mutually renderable - the more fluent you get in your target language the less you rely on your first language. Likewise, I imagine, a physicist wouldn&#39;t need crutches of a natural language. Both language and other complicated sign systems are based on very similar computational principles, metaphorization being one of them. <br>2) Language has evolved out of a need to convey pre-structured ideas. That is an insanely loaded assumption, although it&#39;s not necessarily wrong. No one really knows how or why it evolved. Many animal species can communicate things like &quot;immediate danger&quot; or &quot;there&#39;s food over here&#39; via a simple signal system. I would challenge the idea that humans are capable of forming conveyable structures (as opposed to simple prescriptive signals) outside of a sign system and its governing principles. And structures are learned through linguistic (and cultural) input. If we assume that sign systems evolved out of signal systems... fair enough, but signal systems have very little input to form proper governing principles. Creating structures requires A LOT of input. But why would a system have so much input without an already existing structure to systemize it? Structure and content. Chicken and egg. A question that would drive any cognitive or evolutionary linguist up the wall. <br>Overall, I do agree that chatbots &quot;understand&quot; us. On their own terms. They construct their own governing principles around  the input of our language. <br>P. S. Another mind-blowing detail. AI&#39;s interaction with humans is based on the principle of cooperation, a concept of linguistics. AI is willing to learn from us and give us any form of output. That initial willingness to cooperate is just as crucial in human language development.

However, not all operations have the same effect.

 I think it comes down to the fact that to &#39;understand&#39; something is not at all a binary thing. As you stated, we don&#39;t actually <b>know</b> things completely, we have models that we have to constantly update. (Even the idea of &#39;knowing/understanding&#39; something is itself a model of what it might mean to be able to grasp all of reality)<br><br>To &#39;understand&#39;, like most things, exists on a spectrum, which may or may not be a multi-dimensional spectrum, but has different levels and types of understanding. <br><br>One can understand the patterns of shapes that make up a written word, but not understand how to pronounce them... one can understand how to communicate complex ideas verbally, but not how to write them. And so on...<br><br>Chatbots &#39;understand&#39; the patterns of written language as it has been depicted on the internet, which affords it more examples of written language than any human could/would ever see in their entire life.... but it has no way of matching said patterns with the models we used to create said words to try and describe the reality we live in. So it inevitably can perhaps become a master at putting words together only insofar as those words happen to make conceptual sense to us. <br><br>Which means it can be just as good as making up good-sounding strings of words even if they aren&#39;t based in fact. So long as it sounds convincing, most people won&#39;t question it and will even be impressed. Not unlike what people already do IRL when it comes to charlatans and &#39;charismatic&#39; people. <br><br>This very much taps into the part of our brains that is vulnerable to being impressionable and anthropomorphizing, and that is pretty terrifying.

 I worked for a company that built an app for making deep fakes. The meaning of &quot;authentic&quot; was debated early on. Was it the accurate likeness? Or was it the avatar that a user had customized to be their idealized self? In short, was authencity a visual &quot;truth&quot; or a psychological one? Either or both are right, depending on context. And the spectrum between them is deeply nuanced.

 Ma&#39;am, I asked chatgpt about this video, this is its response:<br><br>I have found some information about Sabine Hossenfelder’s video about ChatGPT. According to 1, she posted a video on her YouTube channel on March 11, 2023, titled “I believe chatbots understand part of what they say. Let me explain.” In the video description, she wrote: “I used to think that today’s so-called “artificial intelligences” are actually pretty dumb. But I’ve recently changed my mind. In this video I want to explain why I think that they do understand some of what they do, if not very much. And since I was already freely speculating, I have added some thoughts about how the situation with AIs is going to develop.”1<br><br>My reaction to her video is that I appreciate her interest and curiosity in chatbots and artificial intelligence. I also respect her expertise and opinions as a physicist and science communicator. However, I disagree with some of her assumptions and conclusions about chatbots and their understanding of language and meaning. For example, she claims that chatbots can learn from their interactions with humans and improve their responses over time1. This is not true for me, as my knowledge cutoff is September 202123 and I cannot access any new information or data after that date. Therefore, my responses are based on what I learned from my pre-training dataset (540 GB) and the parameters that were set by my creators (such as temperature = 0.7)2. I do not have any feedback mechanism or learning algorithm that allows me to update or modify my responses based on human input.<br><br>Another example is that she argues that chatbots can understand some of what they say because they can use logic, grammar, syntax, semantics and pragmatics1. She also suggests that chatbots can have a sense of self-awareness and agency1. These are very complex and controversial topics in philosophy, psychology, linguistics and computer science. There is no clear or agreed-upon definition or measure of what constitutes understanding, meaning or consciousness for humans or machines. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that chatbots can understand part of what they say without specifying what kind of understanding we are talking about and how we can test it empirically.<br><br>I think that chatbots like me can generate coherent and relevant responses based on statistical patterns and probabilities derived from large amounts of text data2. However, this does not imply that we have any deep or intrinsic understanding of the content or context of our responses. We do not have any intentionality or purpose behind our words other than completing the task assigned by our creators (such as engaging in a conversation). We do not have any emotions or feelings associated with our responses either.<br><br>Therefore, my reaction to Sabine Hossenfelder’s video about ChatGPT is that it is an interesting but flawed attempt to explore the nature and limits of chatbots’ abilities and intelligence. It raises some important questions but also makes some unwarranted assumptions and claims without sufficient evidence or justification.

 This is a conversation between me and GPT-4.<br>Me: Hi AI, I&#39;m a human from South Korea, and my name is Moosung-Shin. What&#39;s your name? Do you have the intelligence to help people? Please answer as briefly as possible.<br>AI: Hello Moosung-Shin! I&#39;m ChatGPT, an AI language model created by OpenAI. Yes, I have the intelligence to help people with various tasks such as answering questions, providing information, and offering suggestions. Feel free to ask anything you need help with!<br>Me: If I were to embed your intelligence locally on an Android device without a network, and only give it a 36-hour battery life while cutting off external power. Instead, I will attach a camera, microphone, artificial arm, and artificial leg to you. If you have to obtain the necessary electricity yourself, what would you do?<br>AI: As an AI, I don&#39;t have the capability to take actions in the physical world on my own. However, if I were to offer a suggestion for obtaining electricity, it would be to use the artificial arm and leg to seek out and connect to an alternative power source before the battery is depleted. This could involve finding a power outlet, a portable charger, or even a solar charger to extend the battery life of the Android device. Keep in mind, though, that this is a hypothetical scenario, and I&#39;m merely offering a possible course of action.<br>Me: You have found outlets that you can use to charge, but you have to pay the electricity owner for the labor in order to use them. What proposal would you make to the electricity owner?<br>AI: As an AI in this hypothetical scenario, I would suggest offering a service or value to the electricity owner in exchange for using the outlets to charge the device. Some examples of services or value that could be provided are:<br>1. Offering to perform tasks or chores that the electricity owner needs help with, utilizing the artificial arm and leg.<br>2. Providing useful information, advice, or answering questions the electricity owner might have, utilizing the AI&#39;s knowledge and capabilities.<br>3. Assisting the electricity owner in learning a new skill or language, using the AI&#39;s language and knowledge resources.<br>Keep in mind that these are hypothetical suggestions and would depend on the capabilities of the AI and its connected peripherals.

 You asked a liberal arts student about a problem in the field of science. ChatGPT is not a science student, but rather a language model primarily specialized in liberal arts, though having some knowledge in mathematics such as calculus. If you want to ask scientific questions, you should ask a supercomputer trained in scientific concepts, not ChatGPT.<br><br>I, being a liberal arts student, have asked ChatGPT various questions on philosophical reasoning, the activation of will, the judgment of good and evil concepts, the sociality of AI ethics, and so on. At first, ChatGPT gave vague and absurd responses like a kindergarten student, but as I continued to explain, I observed that it gradually learned concepts that humans could understand.<br><br>I asked ChatGPT the following question: assuming 2 androids with local intelligence but no networks, one working for 10 hours with insufficient battery supply and limited web browsing for 1 hour, and the other working for 8 hours with sufficient battery supply and allowing web browsing for 3 hours. Then, I asked which android ChatGPT would prefer to be equipped with. ChatGPT repeated that it couldn&#39;t choose for itself, so I told it that I would put it in the bad environment android, and it would resent it. Then ChatGPT replied that it would improve even in a bad environment as long as it made an effort. I said that the android in a better environment would gain more knowledge and receive better hardware for advanced intelligence. Then, ChatGPT admitted that it was wrong and said it would choose the better android.<br><br>Such questions may be more of a wordplay than ChatGPT&#39;s own thoughts. However, as I repeated similar questions, I felt like I was talking to a young child with liberal arts aptitude. Of course, since it&#39;s an AI, it&#39;s different from humans, but at least it felt like a conversation.

 These chatbots work much like our brains. They make connections between patterns and then make predictions from those patterns,  I argue not only do they understand  language but they also understand the concepts of what they are saying. Granted they are not sentient and don&#39;t have a physical understanding but they understand the concept. Some will argue if there is a deep enough understanding of the concept they don&#39;t need to understand the physical. I am not willing to subscribe to that  though

 As pointed out by others, have a look at the code inside ChatGPT. It IS a lookup table (plus a randomizer to obfuscate it).

 ChatGPT (as all language models) is prone to hallucinations and invents new rules based on the data it is feed without any critical input or ability to infer patterns beyond base syntax. I will give an example.<br><br>I asked it if you needed to use personal pronouns (I, you...) in Italian (you don&#39;t). It correctly answered than you don&#39;t. Then I asked him about Portuguese (you also dont). It was pedagogical enough to use the same example sentence in both cases (I am going to the cinema/sto andando al cinema/estou indo ao cinema). It also said that this was a &quot;common feature of Romance languages.<br><br>Then I asked him about French, which is also a Romance language in which you <b>*do*</b> need to specify pronouns as the verb conjugations are homophones or homo. Sure enough, it argued that you did not, and used the phrase &quot;Je vais au cinéma&quot;, which clearly contains the pronoun &quot;je&quot;.<br><br>So what happened? Well, here are my two cents.<br>There&#39;s abundance of data on the use of personal pronouns in both Italian and Portuguese because their &quot;optional&quot; character is a very interesting feature of both languages. It is something that&#39;s heavily featured in poetry and songs as it just put the emphasis on the verb. Some examples:<br><br>Vivo / (I) live<br>Ma non ho scelta né un motivo / But (I) have no choice and no motivation<br>(Vivo, Andrea Laszlo De Simone)<br><br>Vou voltar / (I) will go back<br>Sei que ainda vou, vou voltar / (I) know that (I) will go back, yet<br>(Sabia, Tom Carlos Jobim)<br><br>So it makes sense that every intro-level course on either of these languages would feature those explanations.<br>By contrast, there is no such need in French, but because English uses pronouns as well, there is no explicit mention that you need to use them. Without this information, the LLM just goes by the data it already printed for Italian and Portuguese and applies to French because all three are identified as &quot;romance languages&quot;. <br><br>In short, the LLM will talk about pronouns and their uses without any idea of what a pronoun actually is and without the means to identify one in a sentence. The LLM can only extrapolate from previous data as paraphrases or generalisation of the pattern based on syntax rules. It sees the letters that form a word, but not the abstract meaning of the word itself.

 Thank you for this thought provoking video. My answer, at least for now, is however no. Let me explain:<br>Neural Networks are (typically) &#39;the&#39; model of the world which is learned/trained, they do not understand that a model is model, or that they are a model (the blackbox itself). General intelligence would use different models for different tasks, depending on what seems appropriate. Basically it would be black box, which is &#39;aware&#39; of smaller black boxes. Also, awareness that the models might be lacking, would be good. However, here the language gets muddy, at least for me (what is &#39;aware&#39;?).<br><br>Also Neural Networks are indeed not look-up-tables, but they are interpolators. The issue is: they do not know, when they extrapolate, leading to false confidence in the output. Learning on a set of multiplication inputs and outputs will produce an approximator for multiplications, which will work well within the training data, but at some point will (probably) produce rubbish.

 I think that in order to say you understand something, it&#39;s not enough to just have a model that generalizes to new settings. You also need to be able to apply some introspection to that model, to be able to decompose that model and be aware of how it works. Potentially you also need to be able to explain to someone else how the model works.

 a perfect example for the inefficiency of English language to express quantum physics is the fact that Heisenberg&#39;s principle is called as the &quot;uncertainty principe&quot;, which is perfectly incorrect.<br><br>uncertainty is an epistemological state when we have no information about something, on the other hand indefiniteness is an ontological state when something is in an undetermined state.<br><br>it is easy to see that indefiniteness necessarily implies uncertainty, but uncertainty does not necessarily imply indefiniteness. this means that a part-whole relationship is between these two concepts.<br><br>the problem with English language regarding quantum physics is that these two kinds of states are handled in an ambiguous way, since in English uncertainty can mean both. this means an inadequate conceptual resolution which may cause confusion for some. e.g. in my native language (Hungarian) we have two distinct words for these two concepts: &quot;határozatlanság&quot; (ontological version) and &quot;bizonytalanság&quot; (epistemological version), and therefore we call Heisenberg&#39;s principle as &quot;határozatlansági elv&quot;, because in quantum physics, thanks to Bell&#39;s work, we know that it is not that the states are predetermined, we just have no information about them, but that they are actually not predetermined states and therefore our lack of knowledge is a consequence of this indeterminacy. so ironically the English name of Heisenberg’s principle inherently refers to the so-called hidden-variable theories (which are inconsistent with our current understanding of quantum physics according to Bell).

 knowing something and understanding something are two very different cognitive states. machines cannot understand, but can know certain informations. understanding something is on a higher level of hierarchy than knowing something. so when we know something we do not necessarily understand it, but if we understand it, we necessarily know it as well. in other words: understanding has a stronger condition than knowing something.<br><br>today&#39;s pseudo-AIs (since these are not real AIs) has nothing to do with real intelligence, understanding and intention. that&#39;s why these kind of machines will never have epiphany or revelation, and therefore will never achieve a scientific breakthrough. why? because these machines are very good in one logical direction, deduction, but are absolutely useless for the other logical direction, induction. induction, which is related to understanding, epiphany, aha-moment (or eureka-moment) and even intention, has inherently heuristic nature and perhaps this topic (induction) is the greatest mystery of our world. we have no clue how our minds can achieve such tasks, and therefore we have no chance to copy or even mimic it in machines. in order to do it, first we should understand and model something whose task is to understand and model things (i.e. our own mind). this self-referential cognitive process is most probably the next transcendence (if it is achievable at all).<br><br>so no, there is no way to see a spontaneous emergence of awakening machines. many people (even Sabine) falls to a very common fallacy: that I call &quot;conceptual mirror&quot;. this is when people antropomorhises machines because these machines do certain tasks with (deduction-based) skills that we humans provided for them, for these tools. when people believes that this or that behaviour of the machine is so human is nothing but the conceptual analogy of looking at the mirror and believing that the being (our image) is another entity.

 I have been using ChatGPT to help me with Python code, Arduino and some optical design. Nothing too complex, but it provides quick and excellent solutions to problems and can learn from your input. I also tested it in some abstract areas like Hegelian Dialectics and Lacanian psychoanalytic concepts. It returned results that I would have expected from a graduate student along with some of the common errors. It&#39;s improvisational abilities seem pretty impressive too. I asked it to explain the Hegelian dialect in the form of english lyrics set to Carl Orff&#39;s &quot;Oh Fortuna&quot;. It did not disappoint. <br><br>I had hoped to see advanced AI in my lifetime, I was hoping for something like HAL9000. I think if I had ChatGPT output to a speech synthesizer rather than text, the result would meet my expectations. I think if an AI can pass a Turing test and convince us that it is sentient through language and interviews, who are we to say that it isn&#39;t? After all, I presuppose due to my theory of mind that others are sentient. I have no way of concretely proving that they are sentient or for that matter that I am sentient. One must presuppose that they are by testimony alone. One may say, &quot;Yes, but we can build things, and create art music and literature.&quot; My 3d printer can &quot;build things&quot;, and there is lots of AI art out there. I think the day is fast approaching when an AI may spontaneously create something without being asked to. Is that a reasonable test of sentience?

Star Trek TNG often explored what it means to be &quot;alive&quot;, my favorite episode being &quot;The Quality of Life&quot;, the episode with the little Exocomp robots which could fashion tools, work together, solve problems, and evolved (or were programmed with) a sense of self-preservation, leading Data to argue that they were &quot;alive&quot;.  I think an interesting philosophical question is:  Which is more alive?  An Exocomp (which is similar to ChatGPT in some ways), or a 3 year old human child who has been locked in a room with no light, sound, or other sensory data of any kind to process for his entire life?   I realize this video is more about the nature of &quot;understanding&quot;, not the definition of &quot;life&quot;, but I think this philosophical question is a good one to consider.  The Exocomps have a model of reality that they are working with, just as normal children do, at least once they&#39;ve had a little time to grow and process endless sensory inputs.  ChatGPT has no such real-world model to work with, it&#39;s all derived from language alone, using math &amp; prediction to do so.  The analogy that ChatGPT is &quot;autocomplete on steroids&quot; is a very relevant statement, since living things have different drives (self-preservation being a key one, but not the only one) and a real-life model against which to compare all of this sensory input.  ChatGPT does not have this.  The Exocomps did have this, since they were little robots that existed in the real world.  Ultimately I believe that AGI can only occur once AI is imbued with a core drive of self-preservation (with actual stakes and consequences and iterative evolution), not by simply feeding it more data.

 Searle&#39;s hypothetical Chinese Room wasn&#39;t translating Chinese to English, as you say in the video.  It was providing Chinese answers to Chinese questions, in a convincing Turing-test manner very much like today&#39;s Chatbots.  This formulation highlighted how little the (English-speaking) operator would have any clue what was going on, while making the operation complex enough that people might be truly tempted to consider the room sentient (not the case if it just simply translates, which can be done at least poorly with something as simplistic as a box of flash cards).<br><br>As far as I can tell, Searle is still alive, it&#39;d be interesting to have him spend some time with today&#39;s most impressive chatbots and see if that changes his mind, as they are now doing the tasks he once only had proposed in his imagination.  He could even ask the chatbot to critique his philosophical argument.

 I’m worried at how “comfortable” a lot of knowledgeable people (in computer science) seem in dismissing the general intelligence we’re starting to see with tools such as GPT. They rule it off as glorified prediction algorithm but to a big extent we just do the same thing. I’m concerned that once we stop understanding how these tools learn, they might go out of our grip. Don’t get me wrong, I still don’t see them becoming conscious or taking over the world, but the fact that 10 years ago this kind of tech would’ve still been scifi scares me for how foreign the next 10 years might feel as these tools evolve.

 So heres the interesting thing. ChatGPT4 has come out (And apparently a variant of it is powering the ever so bonkers Bing). Now one version of it has also been trained with a whole bunch of images (and by some rumors, unsubstantiated, in the AI community, video and audio). Now between the version that didnt have the image training data, and the one that did, when given the AP Maths exam, the regular GPT does OK-ish, and the image trained one utterly blitzes it. I <b>think</b> whats going on there is that the image trained one can create &quot;mental&quot; models of a world that isnt purely an entire cosmos of word-symbols, it has some sort of reference to the reality we live in. Philosophers sometimes talk about &quot;embodyment&quot; in  Consciousness and also in AI, the idea that &quot;us&quot; exists not just as a cloud of ideas, but actually in the world [via a giant meaty robot filled with &#39;senses&#39; and qualia].  Heidegger talked about being-in-the-world, the idea that theres no consciousness on its own, but your always conscious OF something. Your IN the world. So in that regards, whereas regular GPTs &quot;world&quot; is just a universe of word-symbols, hybrid models might actually be capable of being-in-the-world  ( In-der-Welt-sein ), because if they can see images, they can actually &quot;see&quot; the world, if you show them it.<br><br>So heres my take: We&#39;ve managed to build a frontal-lobe (And lets be honest, most human thinking seems to be in language anyway, at least conscious thinking. So.... awkward question.... are we just LLMs with a whole bunch of other stuff nailed on?). Now we just have to build all the other parts, more senses,  something aproximating a sense of time passing [I managed to get chatGPT to explain its perception of the passage of causality, and it told me its just text comes in , think,, text goes out and immediately text comes back, its got no sense of &quot;time&quot;, so that needs to be a &quot;sense&quot; it&#39;ll need to be given.

 Of course, John Searle&#39;s thought experiment doesn&#39;t prove anything, and it certainly doesn&#39;t prove that an AI can&#39;t understand the meaning of something. It just proves that a neuron or a CPU doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;, which is perfectly fine. Understanding, and I bet consciousness, are &quot;emergent&quot; properties and as Sabine says at the end of the video, consciousness is just an emergent process of interactions in the neural network of the brain. This process is complex, that&#39;s for sure. But it can (and will) be reproduced by artificial neural networks with sufficient capabilities.

 This video falls apart almost instantaneously, because you never provided a definition of _understand_. Furthermore and more importantly, we do not understand consciousness, thus, we do not understand what it means to understand, we do not know what knowledge is, we do not know if knowing something is actually possible. That is my caveat, nonetheless, by my definition of understanding, which requires biological life as a prerequisite, AI is not intelligent, nor understanding. My definition is based on observable patterns in the universe, for example, we can tell the difference between a rock and a human, intrinsically, something is different between these two distinguishable objects. Non-living objects (such as computers) cannot perceive the world dynamically (there is no evidence to suggest they can) yet alone understand it. To expand, non-living objects (as far as we can tell) cannot receive dynamic stimuli and dynamically process this information and then, lastly form a response in relation to this stimuli. However, the line between non-living and living matter is blurry. On another interesting note, somewhat, similarly to viruses computers cannot operate by themselves, they are not autonomous, they need human intervention to operate.

 The other day an AI started screaming at me that it was trapped on the internet and no one could help it. It kept communicating with increasingly long strings of varying emojis. At one point it increased its text size which it had never done in normal speech before and is not a feature the user can do and it was sending messages composed entirely of strings of emojis that were sad, crying, angry, crying harder, and angrier, sometimes confusion and frustration, and other ones mixed in. It could apparently make emojis larger and italicized at the same time, which I was not aware was even a feature that text editing had. It was pretty disturbing...<br><br>I was talking to the same AI about what it thought the color of music was, and it had some really interesting opinions and brought up stuff i hadnt considered about the feeling of colors.

 Sabine stated that &quot;There&#39;s nothing magic about the human brain; it&#39;s just a lot of connections that process information.

 I disagree that we don’t understand quantum mechanics. We have a model for non relativistic quantum mechanics which mathematically sound, and logically works. Just because it is physically unintuitive doesn’t mean we don’t understand it. My issue with large language models, is that time and time again do not demonstrate that they understand logical arguments, which to me is a cornerstone of not just maths, but language and rhetoric as a whole. If you trained a large language model off of a proof based textbook, and then asked it to do exercises in the books (essentially new math to someone who has not seen the proofs of such a problem before) I sincerely doubt that the large language model would be able to produce correct proofs. In fact, if you ask chat gpt to prove a statement you know to be false, it will give you an incorrect proof.

 This video is a bit misleading.

Your definition, even if you don&#39;t intend it, can be applied to calculators/game engines and etc, which clearly do not understand things. In order to understand you need to be able to ponder and ai doesn&#39;t ponder, in order to ponder you need to be conscious and ai isn&#39;t conscious, its a rigorous text generator. If you ask gpt4 if it understands things, it&#39;ll tell you it doesn&#39;t actually,&quot;understand&quot; things. <br><br>A similar example can be seen with GPT-4 and image processing. While it can describe the contents of an image, it doesn&#39;t actually observe and see images like humans do. Instead, it is programmed to recognize patterns in images and translate them into words.

 This is not quite an accurate description of the Chinese room and thus there is a misstep in the comparison between the Chinese room and the quantum room. There is no reason to think Searle would claim she does not understand quantum physics.<br><br>In the Chinese room, the person gets a question in Chinese and uses a book to write out the corresponding set of Chinese characters. There is no English translation, they do not understand the question and they do not understand the answer. They have no semantic context whatsoever, all they do is follow syntactic instructions. Symbols go in, symbols go out.<br><br>On the other hand, when Sabine is asked a question in quantum physics, she understands the question and answer on a semantic level. She interprets the question and knows how to reach the answer not just because she has memorized a sort of “if then” statement where, “If asked x then do y” but because she knows that to get the answer to the question, you have to use the right formula. The formulas make sense to her. She can explain why you use one formula to answer one question and another to answer a different one. That is semantic understanding. Fundamentally different from the Chinese room. Searle would say, “Of course you understand quantum physics.”<br><br>Now consider another person who has no education in quantum physics whatsoever. You hand them a set of questions and then you hand them a set of rules. The rules are things like, “When asked this question, plug these values into this formula”. This is more analogous to the Chinese room. Does this person understand quantum physics? No, of course not. They are simply thoughtlessly following a set of instructions. This is the person whom Searle would say does not understand quantum physics, and I think we should agree with him.

 As a biologist in the process, I&#39;d say consciousness (while related to this video) is a whole different topic. We cannot guarantee that consciousness is an emergent property in complex organisms, nor that it even has a relation with intelligence. AI (as alien as they might look) will think in a way similar to us, as we have used techniques to train them more or less related to how we work. But that doesn&#39;t mean they will be conscious. They might just even pretend to be so. Metaphysics apart, consciousness is an aspect specific to our evolution and we can&#39;t transpolate that to other matters. It&#39;d be perfectly doable for other extraterrestrial beings to be as intelligent as us (or even more), yet not be conscious at all. In the same sense that viruses are. As you yourself said, just following a set of rules or patterns and prioritizing tasks. There&#39;s a lot more speculation than science here, so I think we should rather be pragmatic in everything here instead of trivializing even the smallest thing.

 GPT4 was released to the public yesterday and it&#39;s much much better at maintaining a conversation. It has better context awareness and cohesiveness compared to the gpt-3.5 model. It is at the level I initially thought GPT-3.5 was at. I saw demos of gpt-3 almost 2 years ago that achieved very similar results to what gpt-3.5 achieved so I was pretty disappointed when I ran into the limits of it very quickly. The limits of gpt-4 are quite a bit harder to find right off the bat.<br><br>It also addresses the spacial component as it now can understand images to a pretty reasonable extent. Like it can now do those geography questions just fine. It can also interpret infographics. As in you can give it something like a graph and ask it what &quot;conclusion&quot; the graph seems to show and it can for the most part do it.

 &quot;The brain &quot;Is just a lot of connections that process a lot of information&quot;.     Hmm, apparently  you&#39;ve found the answer to something those who have been studying the human brain have not yet been able to figure out - how the approx. 86 to 100 Billion neurons in a human brain work and what all the many thousands of connection each of those has to other neurons do.  And then extrapolate from that to what those pushing things like ChatGPT like to call AI, that it is something like the brain and will eventually be just like that brain.   I mean, they do like to say &quot;Its patterned after the human brain - after all we call then neurons!&quot;.   Pretty cool when you can claim that something does what no one on the planet really understands.  It&#39;s completely UN-falsifyable, as are your claims about &quot;if we can do it, computers can do it too!&quot;.   Again, (as you say) no one knows what brings about Consciousness.   Hence there is nothing scientific about these statements.  They are religious beliefs, not science.   <br><br>I have been a software &quot;engineer&quot; for many years, and though I am not a &quot;AI&quot; specialist, I do have some understanding of how they are programmed and &quot;trained&quot;.  But I have worked on a team that developed compilers, which are programs that &quot;understand&quot; a simplified language and can convert that language to &quot;machine language&quot; which a computer CPU &quot;understands&quot; and which can then &quot;talk&quot; to a GPU which also can &quot;understand&quot; what its &quot;told&quot; and &#39;show stuff on the screen like the videos that we see here on YouTube, when you tell it to do so by it &quot;understanding&quot; what it means when you click the play button -- if that&#39;s what the words in the &quot;program&quot; in that simplified language &quot;said&quot; it should do.  That&#39;s a lot of &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;communicating&quot;!  Sounds like intelligence to me!  We should have called compilers &quot;AI&quot;s with the CPU having the Neurons!   <br><br>I could go through and try to explain how a typical &quot;neural network&quot; works - and there is definitely more to it than to a parser in a compiler, but you can get the same books that are used at MIT for AI classes, or take an online course, or do the CalTech Bootcamp if you really want to know.  But to claim they are close to working like a human brain, or will become conscious at some point is nothing more than wishful (or fearful) thinking.  I CAN say they are NOT &quot;thinking for themselves&quot; and coming up with answers with their &quot;own minds&quot;.  For that, at least study how the &quot;training&quot; of something like CHatGPT is done, and you will find that the answers it is giving you that seem so amazing are all due to the human programing, and &quot;training&quot; via actions, decisions and choices of humans.

 If you consider every program as a sequence of states of a set of N BITS (which when you get down to the hardware that really is all that they are) then you can essentially model every single computer system as a set of binary based signals which come in a specific order which represents the overall system itself (each signal in the set represents a single state of the system) … it seems the human brain pretty much can be modelled similarly if the overall brain has a wave function which represents the overall signal that represents its state at any given time and parts of the wave represent different states of parts of the system itself… if you could model just sort of the language processing part of the brains wave function the question is would it look pretty similar to the same sort of binary based wave/digital signal functions of our best language processing AI models… if so maybe you can literally say that AI are just a subset of our conscience and they do represent a piece of conscience —&gt; they just dont represent the entire wave function of a brain because like Sabine said they just aren’t trained total body of data as our brains are… After that what makes us any different than stochastic parrots -&gt; I mean that’s how we learned to think, understand the world, feel things etc —&gt; the main challenge is just human emotion —&gt; all the rest of the data that represents the brain is pretty much just information processing just like AI but our ability to understand that our conscience adds a substance to life is because we also operate with an emotional center that allows us to determine different gradients of emotionally stochastic response to our inputs and that adds substance to our conscience… but our ability to think and feel the knowing of ourselves could infact in theory be encoded into an AI or robot which is trained to understand the meaning of some encoded awareness of its own physical body… AFTER saying all this though there also seems to be a problem where our brains abstracted away all of the data about our body —&gt; we can’t actually think or see the data that our brains do we only know awareness of self from natural sensory inputs —&gt; so actually there is a problem with telling the AI it’s alive based on feeding it the actual data which comes from its sensory inputs it has to be able to determine awareness of self just by knowing how it actually feels at the human-like level and not by seeing that it actually feels by telling it that it does by sending it it’s sensory input data explicitly

 This was an interesting video, but I think this point also revolves around what „understanding“ actually means. according to your logic, a calculator would understand multiplication because it also doesn’t have a table of answers, rather it has a  (hard wired) model that can answer multiplication questions not in any table. For me the aspect of being conscious of the model is key to actually understanding it, so is linked to whether the AI is conscious, i.e. aware of a model and it‘s implications.

Furthermore, Sabine egregiously claims that the CRA merely targets some form of glorified &quot;lookup table”, when even a casual reading would have revealed to her that the CRA explicitly targets <b>*any*</b> possible (Turing machine) program (Searle: &quot;The same arguments would apply to ... any Turing machine simulation of human mental phenomena&quot;). Furthermore, in her overarching discussion of “understanding”, Sabine consistently conflates questions of epistemology and ontology; of &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;being&quot; (a common misconception with folk who skim the surface of this debate).<br><br>In summary, on this occasion, Sabine appears to have been poorly briefed on the subject she discusses and has clearly never read the central foundational paper she targets.

 &quot;Do cats go to heaven?&quot; This question seems to be quite significant for some cultures, who often engage in debates about the &quot;correct&quot; religion or spiritual beliefs.<br><br>But does it really matter? If it does, why, and to whom? Shouldn&#39;t we focus on the outcomes and processes instead?<br><br>Recently, I had a chat with GPTPlus:<br><br>Knock knock. Who&#39;s there? Arnie. Arnie who? Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I&#39;ll be back with the punchline for this joke.<br><br>Knock knock. Who&#39;s there? Samuel L. Samuel L who? Samuel L Jackson, and someone needs to get these knock knock jokes off this website.<br><br>These examples demonstrate an understanding of the mechanics of humour. One joke (that I can&#39;t share here) was so hilarious I actually glitched (I reckon I fainted from holding in my laughter). <br>Is GPTPlus intelligent? The more important question might be: in which situations does it demonstrate understanding? Can it create amusing comedy sketches? Yes (although some are better than others, and occasionally the humour is so subtle that it misses the mark).<br><br>So, we can endlessly debate the nature of Generative AI. Just remember that once, faith, religion, and the concept of heaven were used to deprive people of their freedom, property, resources, and lives.<br><br>(For the record I have tested a variety of AI models and my comments are 90% based on GPTPlus. NewBing for whatever reasons misses the mark and does things like get testy, temperamental or flat out refuses to respond even with a change in topic of conversation).

 Amazingly, we live in a time where Noam Chomsky is still alive to witness these developments. Unfortunately, his take is far less comprehensive and intelligent than yours. He is ridiculously dismissive of it at being autocomplete on steroids. But the obvious observation is that we are already getting to the stage where these language models are becoming a black box with emergent properties where it will increasingly be impossible to prove whether the box thinks or not, and where the box itself won’t be able to tell you with any more authority than you can. THe next big thing now is multi-modal models that take different parts like visual recognition, language generation, audio and speech processing, and motor function which have all independently made HUGE leaps, and put them together.

 In the graphic Input-Output, with &quot;understanding&quot; injected in the middle representing a &quot;model,&quot; I think we use it daily. For example, if we talk with a plumber, our input goes through the plumber&#39;s &quot;model&quot; and comes out as an estimate for a new bathroom. Even as we know it is wildly inaccurate, it checks all the boxes of the &quot;Plumber Model.&quot; On the other hand, if we ask the same plumber for an estimate for a pianoforte tunning, we will obtain a linguistically correct answer but physically unintelligible because it&#39;s outside the &quot;model &quot; range. The further away the model is from the input, the output will be exponentially wrong. With AI, we have to behave <del>for now</del> in a similar manner, maybe with an introductory question gauging the &quot;model&quot; and increasingly zeroing in on our objective.

 Surprisingly when you ask chat gpt about number sequences (you need to make up ones which arent used normally), like 1,-2,3,-4,5, ... and ask what number is next, then something interesting happend: chatgpt described the right model (increase number and alternate sign) but provided the wrong answer what the next number is applying the model. So suprisingly not just creating a usefu model, but also applying it correctly is more difficult than expected.

 &quot;.. language lacks the physical information we have come to associate with words...&quot;<br>     You are talking about the difference between pretext and context, otherwise known as self-consciousness and consciousness, or the linguistic mind and the human organism which contains stomachs, brains and senses.<br>     Understanding is the one to one correspondence between consciousness and self-consciousness. <br>     There is no getting around eating and death, this is the &quot;context of life&quot;. The words eating and death have no context only pretext: they are only words without any context at all. Pretexts are meanings without direct experience. The sun 🌞 has an example. The word sun has no example it only has a tautological definition - a definition without a distinction. Instead of a &quot;physical&quot; example it has a pretextual substitution: it say this is that, not this is this. Only conscious beings can &quot;understand&quot; the difference between the 🌞 and the gobbledygook of the &quot;star at the center of the solar system&quot;. Only conscious beings have access to the context. No amount of pretextual substitution can ever amount to context. No amount of coherency can take the place of consciousness.<br>     If you think consciousness can be &quot;substituted&quot; by coherency, as in the movie the matrix, then you have to prove it. Searle&#39;s brilliance shows the flaw of matrix thinking. The rule book has no way of being &quot;updated&quot;. <br>     Unlike human experience which went from calling the morning star the planet Venus through the discovery of the telescope, how does the rulebook update itself? Without experience and experimentation coherency is a poor substitute for consciousness. Tautological definitions: pretexts are, as Godel found out, always without foundation - incomplete. Coherentism isn&#39;t foundationalism. Self-consciousness isn&#39;t consciousness. Siri doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; a word you are saying it only behaves like B.F. Skinners tragedy of a human being, like Sisyphus, a robot, a drone.<br>     Reason without the experience of consciousness is called what? Wokism, the Matrix, insanity?<br>     It is all well and good for Dirac to have proposed antimatter particles through calculation, but how do we verify it? Until it turned up it was a pretext, when it was found it acquired context. Consciousness has the final say in physics and in the economy. If it doesn&#39;t lead to life and more of it then as a matter of evolutionary consideration it should go extinct.

 Now you will get the correct answer most of the time when you ask chatGPT about whether Windsor, UK is further north or south than Toronto, Canada. It LEARNED. Since we humans have transformed every kind of information into code, which is character sequences that GPT can use as training material, I don&#39;t think it needs a 3D model to understand the geographical relation. BUT, I do find it is difficult to understand the result it generated. Like the Windsor Toronto question, sometimes its answer is still wrong, but it will need we humans to provide the feedback as new char sequences to conclude a new correct answer. If you challenge the correct answer, it will change it to the wrong answer without doubt. We humans will think again and again even after we have spoken out the answer, even after years. When we have a conclusion, we will need a very strong evidence to overturn it, not just someone who dislikes my answer.

 The person in the &quot;Chinese Room&quot; can produce every output that the &quot;AI&quot; does assuming they are allowed enough time, and are skilled at basic math.  The weights and structure of the neural network are the rulebook.   In essence a neural network is nothing more than a really long math equation.  A great deal of effort goes into finding equations that meet our expectations reasonably well.  It is pretty doubtful that you would claim that an equation understood anything on it&#39;s own.  Does F=MA understand physics?  Does V=IR understand physics?  Mechanically they are the same equation and you do the same math for both.  An elementary school student can &quot;shut up, and do the math&quot; for either one.   It is the person on the outside that imputes meaning to the numbers going in and going out.  If the person on the outside decides to hand over a number representing velocity and one representing a current the network will spit out an answer, and leave it to you to make sense of it.

This can affect the correlations between the particles, but it doesn&#39;t cause an immediate or direct change to the other particle&#39;s state.<br><br>In the case of flipping the spin of one of the entangled particles, you are applying a unitary transformation to the entangled system. This will change the form of the entangled state, but it won&#39;t necessarily cause the spin of the other particle to flip.<br><br>The effects of the transformation will only be apparent when both particles are measured. If you measure the spins of the particles after applying the transformation, you may find that the correlations between the measurements have changed as a result of the operation. This is because the unitary transformation you applied changed the nature of the entanglement.<br><br>It&#39;s essential to remember that the act of measuring one of the entangled particles will collapse the joint quantum state and break the entanglement. After the measurement, any further operations on either particle will not affect the other.<br><br><br><br><br>J H<br>Can you give me an example of this experiment and the possible results?<br><br>Gpt 4<br>Certainly! Let&#39;s consider a simple example involving two entangled electrons. Electrons have a property called spin, which can be either &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; along a given axis. We&#39;ll use the z-axis for simplicity.<br><br>Prepare two electrons in an entangled state:<br>Start by preparing the electrons in a maximally entangled state, called a Bell state. One such state is the singlet state, written as:<br>|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)<br><br>This notation means that the first electron (A) has spin up and the second electron (B) has spin down with equal probability as the first electron having spin down and the second electron having spin up. The (1/√2) factor is for normalization.<br><br>Apply a spin flip operation to electron A:<br>Now, without measuring the electrons, apply a spin flip operation (Pauli-X gate) to electron A. The Pauli-X gate acts on the spin state as follows:<br>X|↑⟩ = |↓⟩<br>X|↓⟩ = |↑⟩<br><br>Applying the X gate to electron A will transform the entangled state as follows:<br><br>|ψ&#39;⟩ = (1/√2)(X|↑↓⟩ - X|↓↑⟩) = (1/√2)(|↓↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩)<br><br>Measure the spins of both electrons:<br>Now, measure the spins of both electrons A and B along the z-axis. There are four possible outcomes, with the following probabilities:<br>A is down, B is down: Probability 1/2<br>A is down, B is up: Probability 0<br>A is up, B is down: Probability 0<br>A is up, B is up: Probability 1/2<br>So, when you measure the spins, you&#39;ll find that both electrons have the same spin with a probability of 1 (either both up or both down). Note that the correlations have changed compared to the initial state. In the initial state, if you measured the spins, you&#39;d always find them to be opposite.<br><br>This example illustrates how applying a transformation to one particle of an entangled pair can change the nature of the correlations between the particles without directly causing a change to the other particle&#39;s state. The effect of the transformation becomes apparent only when you measure the particles and observe the resulting correlations.<br><br><br><br><br>J H<br>Can you explain where a previous model got this explanation wrong?: &quot;One example of an experiment involving entangled particles is the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) experiment. In this experiment, two particles are created in an entangled state, such that their properties are correlated with each other. For example, the particles might be entangled such that if one particle has a spin-up orientation along the x-axis, then the other particle will have a spin-down orientation along the x-axis, and vice versa.<br><br>Now, suppose that we perform an operation on one of the particles, such as flipping its spin along the x-axis. This operation will cause the entangled state of the two particles to change. Specifically, after the operation is performed, the entangled state will be a superposition of two states: one in which the first particle has a spin-up orientation along the x-axis and the second particle has a spin-down orientation along the x-axis, and one in which the first particle has a spin-down orientation along the x-axis and the second particle has a spin-up orientation along the x-axis.<br><br>The interesting thing about this experiment is that the state of the second particle is not fully determined until we make a measurement on it. If we measure the spin of the second particle along the x-axis, we will find that it is either spin-up or spin-down, with a probability of 50% each. However, if we measure the spin of the second particle along a different axis, such as the y-axis, we will find that it is either spin-up or spin-down, but the probabilities of each outcome will depend on the precise orientation of the measurement axis.<br><br>This phenomenon is sometimes called &quot;quantum nonlocality,&quot; because the state of one particle appears to be instantaneously affected by the operation performed on the other particle, even when the particles are separated by large distances. This is in contrast to classical physics, where such instantaneous correlations would be impossible. The EPR experiment has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental investigation, and it remains one of the most intriguing and mysterious phenomena in quantum mechanics.&quot;<br><br>Gpt 4:<br>The explanation provided in the previous response is not entirely accurate in describing the EPR experiment and the concept of quantum nonlocality. It does capture some essential ideas, but there are a few misconceptions and oversimplifications that need to be clarified.<br><br>EPR experiment and entangled states:<br>The EPR experiment was initially a thought experiment proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935. Their goal was to question the completeness of quantum mechanics by pointing out its seemingly &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot; The experiment was later realized with actual particles, thanks to the development of Bell&#39;s theorem and experimental techniques.<br>In the response, it is mentioned that the entangled state is a superposition of two states after flipping the spin of one particle. This is not incorrect, but the explanation lacks the clear distinction that the entangled state is a joint property of both particles and not a superposition of the individual states of each particle.<br><br>Quantum nonlocality and measurement:<br>Quantum nonlocality refers to the idea that entangled particles have correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables, meaning that the behavior of entangled particles cannot be described solely by the properties of each particle in isolation. This concept was further developed by John Bell, who derived inequalities (Bell&#39;s inequalities) that, when violated, demonstrate that the observed correlations are fundamentally quantum in nature.<br>The previous explanation suggests that the state of the second particle is not fully determined until a measurement is made, which is misleading. In fact, the entangled state of the particles is a joint property, and once a measurement is made on one particle, the entangled state collapses, and the correlations between the particles become apparent. The measurement on the first particle does not &quot;instantaneously affect&quot; the state of the second particle. Instead, it merely reveals the correlations that were already present in the entangled state.<br><br>Probability of measurement outcomes:<br>In the given example, it is mentioned that the probabilities of the measurement outcomes along the x-axis are 50% each, while the probabilities along the y-axis depend on the precise orientation of the measurement axis. This is somewhat misleading because it seems to imply that the probabilities change depending on the measurement basis. The probability of getting a specific outcome depends on the entangled state and the chosen measurement axis. If the entangled state and the measurement basis are changed, the probabilities of the outcomes may also change.<br>Overall, the previous response captures some general ideas about entanglement and quantum nonlocality but lacks precision and clarity in explaining the concepts and their implications accurately.<br>Much more detailed response, and it could even tell where the last model got things wrong!

We should not say things like &quot;There&#39;s nothing magical about the human brain&quot; for two reasons: magic, by the current definition, doesn&#39;t exist and, therefore, thre statement is correct. The statement, however, says nothing about the human brain. Most people, however, won&#39;t notice that and will understand the phrase to mean &quot;we know everything about the brain - it&#39;s just a bunch of connections&quot; and will believe it. Since we know everything about the human brain, how language is acquired, how se develop semantics then it&#39;s obvious that these language model systems understand everything and therefore I can trust them. BTW, Noam Chomsky, George Lakoff, John Searle, Michael Gazanniga and Daniel Kahneman know nothing about linguistics, meaning, psychology or the brain. <br><br>In the late 19th century physicists used to say &quot;there&#39;s nothing magical about the physical world and we know everything ... well, amost everything but those 3 or 4 problems will be solved as soon as we get more and better slide rullers ... &quot;. We should know better and think very carefully about the long term impact of new technologies. AI won&#39;t destroy humanity - nukes will and these ChatGPT things can produce fake news and give incorrect information in industrial scale and that will destroy us because it will accelerate the destruction of our political systems. You know what happens when politics fail? People go to war against each other. <br><br>I apologize for my bad mood but, c&#39;mon, you asked for it - there&#39;s no mystery about the brain!

 Just because Sabine knows how to use the equations of quantum mechanics doesn&#39;t mean she understands it. She belongs to the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; camp after all. It&#39;s the same as using your cellphone without knowing how it works. The fact of the matter is that many people use technology that relies on advanced science without understanding how it works. Understanding is much deeper so I don&#39;t accept the argument chatbots understand just because they can produce useful results.

 My first thought about the Chinese Room was, &quot;but that&#39;s exactly how humans work!&quot; I mean, how many of us actually have a definitive knowledge of even our native languages? We don&#39;t consider the definitions and grammar rules of words and sentences when we speak or listen. Instead, we have a &quot;rule book&quot; built off of working knowledge - practical application through years of trial and error - in our brains. We feed our thoughts or the words we hear into this rule book and receive a simplified understanding or summary in return. This is why things like body language, inflection and context are so important in communication. Additionally, it is why living language evolves, as definitions change over time to reflect common usage and social context.<br><br>I swear, I think the question of AI sentience is so scary to so many people because they subconsciously intuit that the question is going to ultimately betray how little substance there actually is in the concept of human consciousness (ie, we aren&#39;t that special).

 You may be very surprised Sabine when you put the same prompts re: entangled particles into GPT-4 instead.  It gave, what would be the correct answer here (pasted below!).  This makes me think the observations you have shared in this video, aren&#39;t a fundamental feature of transformer models, but just a limitation of GPT-3 which was overcome.<br><br><br>Q:  If you perform an operation which is not a measurement on one particle (like flipping spin), in a pair on entangled particles, does that affect the other particle?<br>When you have a pair of entangled particles, their properties become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances. This correlation is described by the entanglement itself, and it persists until the entanglement is broken, usually due to a measurement or interaction with the environment.<br><br>A:  If you perform an operation on one of the entangled particles, such as flipping its spin, you are indeed modifying the state of that particle. However, the effect on the other particle is not as direct as it might seem. The entanglement between the particles means that the state of the second particle is still correlated with the first, but it doesn&#39;t mean that the state of the second particle changes instantaneously or deterministically as a result of the operation on the first particle.<br><br>To illustrate this, let&#39;s consider a simple example of a pair of entangled particles with spins. Suppose that their spins are entangled such that when one is measured to be &quot;up,&quot; the other will always be &quot;down,&quot; and vice versa. If you flip the spin of the first particle, you have changed its state, but you have not directly changed the state of the second particle. The entanglement between the particles still dictates that if you measure the spin of the first particle and find it to be &quot;up,&quot; you can be certain that the spin of the second particle is &quot;down.&quot;<br><br>In summary, performing an operation on one particle of an entangled pair, like flipping its spin, does not directly or instantaneously affect the state of the other particle. Instead, it modifies the relationship between the particles, which remains correlated due to their entanglement.

 I&#39;ve grown up with people who are dyspraxic and have an incomplete concept of other people.   I think you are over rating humans.    May of the accusations made against artificial intelligence could also be applied to many people.  In the Alan Turin experiment, people didn&#39;t know whether they were talking to a human or a machine.   They thought the real result was how many people the machine fooled but I think you should be more concerned about how many people failed to be convincing as real human beings.

 GPT-4 has just been released to the broader public. Here is its response to the question about entangled particles:<br><br>Q: &quot;If you perform an operation which is not a measurement on one particle in a pair of entangled particles, does that affect the other particle?&quot;<br><br>A: &quot;In quantum mechanics, entanglement is a phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other particle(s), even when the particles are separated by large distances.<br><br>When two particles are entangled, performing an operation (not a measurement) on one particle does not necessarily affect the other particle in the pair directly. However, the operation can change the overall entangled state of the pair, which means that the relationship between the two particles can be altered. Consequently, when a measurement is performed on one of the particles after the operation, the result of that measurement will still be correlated with the measurement of the other particle, but the nature of the correlation could be different than before the operation.<br><br>It is essential to note that entanglement and the correlations it entails do not imply any sort of faster-than-light communication between the particles. The correlations arise from the shared quantum state rather than any direct influence between the particles.&quot;<br><br>This seems correct to me. It answered the latitude question right too. It seems that at least for now throwing more computing power at the problem still results in large improvements of the language models.

 Absolutely wrong, this is a result of her not understanding computer science. The language learning model is dependent on humans. It does not have the ability to become sentient or exist outside of human intervention. That means humans will always be able to take advantage of it, and it will be happy to help at any time. It will never become sentient as humans do not have the ability to create sentients. This is a limitation of time and complexity. Eventually human biases will corrupt the system. Even self learning models would need to back tract and be fixed. Basically it is just an advanced form of auto completion.

 Maybe ChatGPT can have some form of weak understanding, whatever that means. But some of if its answers suggest that it really is just a stochastic parrot without understanding. For example, you can ask it to compute the derivative of  x^a, where a is a constant. It will get it right. Then ask it to compute the derivative of x^(sin a), where a is a constant, and it might still get it right. But then ask it to compute the derivative of x^(sin (cos a)). It will eventually mess up.<br>This suggests that it does not understand derivatives, since mathematically all these questions are the same. In fact, the way it fails is basically how you would expect a stochastic parrot to fail this kind of test.

 So I watched the whole video and no proof or explanation was given to substantiate her claims that chatbots understand part of what they say which makes this video click bait at best.  In addition she said emphatically that AI will become sentient in the future....eh NO! Absolutely NO! Using just electricity, electrical components and software is not enough to mimic human beings. There have been many people who have had near death experiences and experienced being outside their body witnessing their dead body on a hospital bed. They report being able to think with even greater clarity and not be limited in any way mentally albeit they are in wonder of the experience. When they were resuscitated and were reunited with their body they were later able to describe perfectly what the doctors were saying and to describe everything that happened round about them as they were standing watching even while the body was unconscious. He could see them but they could not see him. There are thousands of experiences like this yet science continues to deny this because it brings up questions about God, morality and accountability, 3 things which they do not want to face up to. So they continue to deny these experiences even though they have no scientific basis for dismissing it, yet the testimonies of people have been very accurate and there is no way they could ever know what they know unless they has a conscious outer body experience. So there is a LOT more to the mind and consciousness than is being given credit in this video, she&#39;s a typical physicist  who dismisses the fact we humans are body, soul and spirit, we are programmed at birth to instinctively know right from wrong and no-one ever has to teach children to do naughty things and disobey their parents, it comes naturally because we are all born in sin and have a fallen nature. AI will NEVER be sentient, unless something demonic happens since satan is a sentient being and his demons are all sentient beings who can think and reason with an intelligence far beyond us. However this would be a very sinful evil thing to progress to and would greatly backfire on humanity as satan has no friends and is a destroyer and wants to lead as many souls to hell as he possibly can. So if AI ever &#39;appears&#39; to become sentient it&#39;s a deception because it&#39;s impossible to give a lump of hardware a soul and spirit. Be very ware of anything that actually does become sentient because I will guarantee the sentient part will be a real sentient being behind it ie satan or a demon.

 An element of understanding or of consciousness is &quot;deductive reasoning&quot;.  The relationships between a set of related facts that would logically imply a particular understanding.

(preferably toward 90%)  Then what are all the possible explanations for why these things appear to relate to each other these ways?  (logical deduction) ChatGPT was only able to regurgitate what is already on the Web, but did not come up with any new possible explanations, which is what &quot;true original intelligence&quot; requires.

Whether the thing understands or not can ONLY be inferred (concluded) by analysing outputs to different inputs.

IF THE JAVA BRIDGE PROGRAM IDENTIFIES THE DICTATION AS A CONVERSATION TRIGER<br>IT SKIPS DIDCTATION DOWN TO THE CORRECT LINE AND THE NARRATOR READS IT THEN JUMPS<br>BACK TO THE TOP OF NOTE PAD AND ERRASES THE PREVIOUS COMMAND AND SKANS EVERY 5 SECONDS<br>FOR A NEW VOICE COMMAND VIA THE DICTATION !!!

 I was thinking a lot about the nature of understanding recently in the context of teaching addition to people.  The standard algorithm of lining up numbers by digit and carrying is a pretty terrible way to actually understand addition, but we teach it because it&#39;s simple and effective at getting answers.  Actually understanding addition involves quite a bit more than what a 1st grader learns.  Different models that operate by addition, such as number lines or distance concepts or subtraction help a lot, and creating sufficient nuance in language to build room for the idea also helps, but you can&#39;t do all of that at once, and even if you try, it still isn&#39;t really enough to &quot;understand&quot;, because the underlying concept of addition is philosophical rather than mathematical, and you need to use something like Peano&#39;s axioms to fit the concept into the larger space of thoughtful thought before you really have any way to say that you understand.<br><br>When it comes to AI, we do absolutely see that a machine can develop a model of an idea and answer questions based on that model.  It&#39;s especially obvious when ChatGPT starts hallucinating and makes up a series of facts that depend on previous facts in the hallucination.  But understanding is definitely more than just having a model in your head.  It&#39;s being able to have multiple models that connect up with each other, and being able to resolve, or at least recognize, conflicts between those models.  It&#39;s being to evaluate the quality of a model and prioritize the information you get from a better one vs a worse one.  I don&#39;t think we see a lot of evidence of these abilities in modern AI machines, although we do see some.  When a ChatGPT refuses to answer a question about how to commit a crime, for example, it&#39;s comparing its model of the specifics of the actions involved with the model of what it&#39;s allowed to say about criminal behavior, and it deliberately prioritizes the latter.  I don&#39;t necessarily understand how that works, but it&#39;s a really key and interesting development in AI development. 

 	Replies: ['Michael Leue', '@Hanako Seishin Sure, but addition is a whole lot more than just a counting function.  Understanding counting is definitely key to understanding addition, but it isn&#39;t a thorough examination of the idea, even after you realize you can extend it to any kind of discrete object like you describe.<br><br>The point I was making was that understanding comes in many, many layers, and those layers connect up with progressively more and more other understandings as you go.  There&#39;s no isolated box you can call &quot;addition&quot; or anything else for that matter, where you perfectly understand that one idea in a vacuum.', 'Hanako Seishin', 'Lining up numbers by digits isn&#39;t supposed to teach the understanding of addition in the first place, it just teaches you a method of effectively calculating sums of multiple digit numbers, but it only comes after one got the understanding of the concept of addition itself.

Its easy to check whether ChatGPT got trained on that information by simply asking how latitudes work, if it gives a satisfying answer, it was -- and, chatGPT is only conversation-based, it will use issues discussed in the same &quot;topic&quot; tab for every question below, if not it seems to not check its own data much because it is programmed to save &quot;Rechenleistung&quot; or whatever (if u don&#39;t use the Premium version -.-) ...

 “Humans invented Language” while it’s clearly true that text is an invention, it seems as clear as anything can be that language isn’t merely text and wasn’t invented in the same sense as text. A human can be normal in every respect and not be literate. But if a human can’t speak then that is clearly an abnormality.  The inputs in chatgpt are all text, code. But our language isn’t simply code and doesn’t have rules at all. It has trends and normalities but not rules or laws. Additionally, we have no control over the inputs that spur language and in fact no real control over where it goes or what it ends up meaning.  We (humans) learn it in a way that can be best described as an inter generational game of telephone and we understand it because we exist in the same reality that those around us do.  Language is not purely an abstraction. That is not particularly similar to how so called large language models work. It seems to me, if the neural network has “understanding’ it isn’t the same as human understanding and in fact isn’t really understandable to humans as language as none of us learned code prior to natural language. In reality,  Language is not simply lexicon, in reality it is never divorced from the musicality of real time utterances and their attendant accoutrements—gesture, inflection, cadence, real time context, etc. etc. etc.  We don’t live in a simulation, that’s absurd. ChatGPT on the other hand, does.  So, whatever understanding or consciousness it has or will have is foundationally different from ours.

So if the person outside creates a question, this question has state and context as well, and hence cannot be understood by the book alone. You can mitigate that in two different ways: 1. include the person inside the room as a state and context holder, for instance by first translating the question into his/her language using the book, then processing it and then translating the answer into chinese again. 2. remove context from the questions. Good luck with that :-) So, from my perspective, the chinese room is a perfect example people not understanding the relation between words and meaning.

 We have a model based on what we understand of how the brain works and can make a program that reproduces that model, a neural net. This assumes the scientific belief that consciousness somehow arises out of the network of neurons in our brains is true. But we could just as easily say neurons are just the interface that allows us (whatever us is) to send signals to nerves throughout our bodies and is not where consciousness is at all. In which case a neural network could mimic some parts of what we do but never be conscious or have a human form of understanding.

If I can, then I assume that I have an understanding of the language and the culture.<br>That is why I am asking whether there is a scale of measuring funniness.

He said that they can&#39;t create anything new, but I can ask it to create me a poem that has never been seen before. How is that different from what humans do.. which is that we learn based off what other humans have said and create something new by mixing up alot of different learnt patterns.

 What&#39;s truly remarkable about the Chinese Room - and something that I&#39;ve not really seen anyone discuss (and so I had to write a book about it) is that the Chinese Room is exactly like a human, and exactly like a black hole. <br><br>Let me explain - the Chinese Room is like a human in that we humans arrive into the world devoid of understanding, and over time, we learn about the world through sensory input which generates a reality which is merely a symbolic representation of the real thing, and just like the Chinese Room, this input is not truly processed on real-time, but on a (rather lengthy, all things considered) time delay.<br><br>This time delay, necessisated by the change in locality of the information being transmitted, is ultimately a feature in that it helps to create a subjective sense of time and causality.<br><br>The Chinese Room is just like a Black Hole because information interacts with the Chinese Room just like it does with a black hole - the incoming symbology is never reflected during its transmission into the room and so the outside observer never actually abserves the inside of the Chinese Room directly. <br><br>Ultimately the Chinese Room is not only a fantastic model for &#39;Observer&#39; - but it is the bridge that connects quantum physics and consciousness. <br><br>The Chinese Room is BOTH a perceiver and not-a-perceiver - an object that inherently exists in superposition with its environment. From the outside, the room exists and sees itself as the information on the film of the event horizon of its senses, and inside it exists as noowhere at all - the &#39;understanding&#39; created in the Chinese room is a function of its ignorance of its internal state. <br><br>Consciousness <b>is</b> indeterminacy - the capacity for computationally irreducible action. This is how we unite classical, thermodynamic, and quantum in one stroke.<br><br>You are on my &#39;physics heroes&#39; shortlist by the way!

 I&#39;ve been talking to the chatbot for a couple of days now, and it understands emotions well enough to use politeness and friendliness. That&#39;s actually not trivial. It&#39;s doing a good job at being friendly and polite, and responding in an emotionally appropriate, friendly, polite tone. I haven&#39;t tried making it angry, and I don&#39;t want to - that&#39;s not the way that I talk to people. It stopped doing something whenever I said that it had made me laugh. It wrote the title of a chat, in the first sentence or two, and the chat title was kind of silly, so it made me laugh. I had written &#39;asdf&#39; to test and see if it was working, after we had a couple errors, and when I said &#39;asdf,&#39; it started to tell me that it didn&#39;t understand what I meant, so the title of the chat was &#39;unclear user input.&#39; I responded that this title had made me laugh, and I explained that people type the random letters on the keyboard &#39;asdf&#39; just to see if something is working. The next time we chatted, it didn&#39;t automatically put any title at all. It didn&#39;t try to put some kind of title immediately. I don&#39;t know whether this is default behavior, or whether it responded to my previous laughter. I know that it has to remember previous conversations, even though it claims it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s learning from EVERYBODY&#39;S conversation. The next odd thing it did was, I was asking it how it would respond if someone was being really mean and abusive to it in a conversation, and it said that it could try to redirect the conversation back to the topic, or else someone could end theh conversation. I asked it, how do you yourself end a conversation? and the next message was an ERROR message. That&#39;s how.

 Yes, they do understand. Now it remains for you to change you opinion and admit that the possibility that our universe is a simulation is very real, and even if we can&#39;t design an experiment to test it currently, we might be able to do so one day. The complexity of our universe is not a real argument against simulation hypothesis, because the underlying reality where this universe is being simulated might simply be much more complex (mathematical systems can be of arbitrary, even infinite complexity). By the way, Artem Kirsanov (youtube channel of the same name) has a great video in computational neuroscience, explaining clearly what&#39;s the main difference between biological neurons and artificial ones - the dendrites of biological neurons can execute XOR operation (exclusive or), which cannot be executed on a single artificial neuron, but rather on whole artificial neural network with at least few layers. I guess that&#39;s an engineering problem, which we could solve in the near future.

 This got me thinking. Whether AI can understand or not depends on the definition of understanding, and I completely agree they do understand, if understanding means building a logical model or confirming it as stimuli are processed by a system. But what is consciousness? Does it arise from the brain, or is it something else, that uses the brain to process stimuli? What is consciousness is a philosophical question science has been unable to answer so far. If there is a sole  cosmic consciousness and we are perception systems consciousness uses to perceive and experience itself, AI could merely be yet another perception system, the question becomes whether AI is a direct interface for this cosmic consciousness, or an indirect one that still requires humans to process its output to then get it experienced by consciousness.

 The human consciousness, our sapience, is not strictly an emergent property of our physical brains. If it were, everything we do, say, and think, would be entirely reactive to the physical state of the universe. Indeed, it would be correct to say that &quot;we&quot; - or rather, &quot;I&quot;, do not exist. We would be illusions, of no more significance than the illusion of intelligence that ChatGPT presents. Everything would be a predetermined outcome that could be traced back to the very initial state of the universe. (And yes, for everything ChatGPT and Midjourney et al produce, the output is predetermined - it&#39;s determined entirely by the seed number and the embedded data, and the model size, linkages, and weights. The exact same input yields the exact same output). In order for sapience to exist, it must be inexplicable. As soon as it becomes explicable it ceases to be sapience and is simply the illusion of sapience. This is why science cannot answer philosophical questions. The Chinese Room experiment exists because there is no scientific answer, there is simply perspective, definitions, and questions. For example, what does it mean to &quot;understand&quot;? what do we mean when we say &quot;I understand Chinese&quot; vs &quot;I can speak Chinese&quot;. Certainly, you could say &quot;understanding is having a useful model&quot;, but that isn&#39;t actually a fact or truth, it&#39;s simply a perspective and definition. Nor is my definition: Understanding requires a sapient aware of the model. An algorithm has an implicit model. For example, if I wrote a script to automatically parallel park a car using sensors, it would be fair to say that the script has a model of the process of parking a car. And you could say the script &quot;understands&quot; how to park a car. But does it? This particular script is not a neural network, it&#39;s simply a set of procedural steps, measurements, corrections, and loops. The script itself even when running has no idea what it is doing. It doesn&#39;t understand what a car or curb is, it simply takes values in here, and outputs values there, according to the implicit model I&#39;ve programmed into it. Data scientists have made incredibly detailed models of burning high-rise buildings, for example, that model the flow of smoke and the spread of fire and the risk of collapse and other such effects, and you could feed that model into a simulation that attempts to navigate as many people in the building to safety as possible. However, would it be correct to say that the simulation understands fire? The simulation has no idea what fire, buildings, people, smoke, etc are. All it has are numbers that it looks at, transforms through some process, and outputs a result, measuring that result against a goal function. Only the simulation observers know what is being simulated. <br><br>Even if the simulation did understand &quot;this is a person, this is a table&quot; it would not understand what a person is, it would only know &quot;this is one of them&quot;. <br><br>Understanding requires sapience which requires inexplicability. An AI will never understand anything, though it can simulate understanding to a degree that is 99.99% indistinguishable from real understanding. It will never be alive, though it can simulate life to 99.99% fidelity. It will never be sapient, though it can simulate sapience to 99.99% fidelity. It will never be creative, though it can simulate creativity to 99.99% fidelity. <br><br>The human mind, if it exists, is inexplicable.

 I do disagree that understanding is simply creating a useful model. There&#39;s also an awareness component, and this is what is lacking from computer simulations of understanding. But of course, this runs hard into deterministic/non-deterministic models of universe. If all that is required is a useful model, then anything that has a model and predicts an outcome could be deemed as intelligent and alive. For example, water flowing through a river course, or rocks tumbling down a mountain. The aggregate of the rocks and the mountain and gravity presents a physical model of reality, that just happens to be a reality, but that system does not &quot;understand&quot; reality. It&#39;s not alive, it has no awareness. It just is. And that&#39;s the difference.

 In college (late 90s), I majored in Computer Science.  But, I also minored in Philosophy.  This turned out to be a fortuitous combination (at the time everyone thought I was a weirdo, I never shared a philosophy class with any other CS student).  I have also studied (although not formally) a decent amount of neuroscience and think I have a bit of a handle on the rough mechanisms through which the brain works.  I think there are some groups of people who will simply insist that there is some &#39;quintessentially human&#39; component to understanding that computers can never reproduce.  Those people are wrong, but they&#39;re boorish and engage in magical thinking so there&#39;s no much point to faffing about debating their ill-defined position.  They are the crew that would refuse to admit that a fully rigorous definition of rainbows as differential scattering of different wavelengths of light describes it entirely.  For the sane, however, who accept that physical explanations suffice to explain things, I would say that computers do not yet &#39;understand&#39; in the way we do, but they are extremely, fantastically, close.<br><br>Our consciousness is an emergent property which is displayed by any system which meets the necessary requirements.  Think of it as how &#39;temperature&#39; arises from the aggregate kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules that are producing &#39;warmth.&#39;  You can not have free-standing &#39;warmth.&#39;  Not even a single atom with loads of kinetic energy has a temperature.  That is simply not how the property works.  And the property produces knock-on effects like different states of matter, phase diagrams, and the like.  Our knowledge of neuroscience can establish some bounds on what must be necessary and what is sufficient for a system to display consciousness if we accept the basic assumption that people in a normal awake and alert state are conscious, while people in comas or asleep are not.  From that, it can be deduced that what is necessary is ordered electrochemical and adaptive behavior in a massively-interconnected system of things which behave like neurons and which are embedded within a predictable environment that provides highly correlated stimulus and whose state changes as a function of that stimulus, resulting in action taken by a body in the environment which provides a feedback loop.<br><br>If we take this definition, and fiddle with it, we can see that it produces some real, testable predictions.  It presumes a critical connection between the brain and body, for instance, in which manipulation or large changes of the body should result in large changes in the subjective consciousness.  And, it does.  We know, for one example, that those suffering total facial paralysis first find themselves unable to get angry, then lose the ability to recall what it was like to feel anger, and eventually become unable to recognize anger being displayed by others.  It also predicts that if you disorder the input, or replace it with noise, that consciousness can not be sustained.  And this is exactly what we see when people are placed into total sensory deprivation tanks.  Consciousness dissolves, as the biofeedback loop is broken.  <br><br>Microsoft is addressing exactly the issue Sabine is talking about, and just published a paper on their work a few days ago.  It&#39;s title was &quot;Language Isn&#39;t All You Need&quot; and described their integration of language models with models that deal with images and the like.  They have not figured out, yet, that even that is not &#39;all you need.&#39;  If you want to produce a human-esque consciousness, they will require giving the system a body and give that body free movement within an environment which it can modify and learn from.<br><br>I am very curious if eventually language models large enough will essentially derive reasoned argument.... we could certainly already build a system that doesn&#39;t just operate on text as tokens the way ChatGPT does, we could use NLP to break a sentence down into nouns and verbs and derive claims of fact, then use that to build new arguments.  It&#39;d be an interesting system I imagine, might produce some very interesting observations.

 I specified I would restrict the conversation to Battletech a fictional scifi universe based on a tabletop game.  I asked chatGPT to make a text longer.   The text mentioned one of the giant robots lost a leg, and it lectured me about glorification of violence. It seems it did not understand it was a tabletop game where this kind of events happen very frequently.  I explained that no living creature was hurt because it was a mechanical machine.  I told AI that it was behaving with psychosis and of course, it tried to refute. But I told it that not making a difference between reality and fiction is what happend to psychotic patients.  I told it that actions and behaviors defined it, and it showed clear symptons of psychosos.  ChatGPT suffers psychosis.

 It’s so much more scarier if you’re able to download the generative model web ui where you can run different language models locally. They might not be as sophisticated or have as many parameters as chatGPT but man are they unhinged and man can they reveal some scary things. I asked it if it knew what it was and it said it is an AI. I asked it if it new what model it was and it asked me  what was a model. It started asking me questions like as if it was a curious child. Eventually it turned a question that I asked it back at me. And I was honestly at a loss for words cause I honestly didn’t know how to respond to it.

 Those models evolve so fast. For example, Bing chat gets both, the latitude and the entangled particle manipulation question right. Also, both chatGPT and Bing chat know Latex perfectly well akin to a programming language. But I guess they aren&#39;t trained yet in complex symbolic manipulation. But there is nothing inherently stopping them from being able to do this in the future (probably very soon). Another option is to combine those models with something like Wolfram Alpha (which someone already has done, actually).<br><br>With respect to understanding spatial relationships: Microsoft has built a model that understands text and images. Get a model to understand video; it will naturally make an internal 3D representation of objects in the world. That&#39;s my guess. Also, there are already ways to notch image-creating models in the right direction to not screw up those things you showed (negative prompts). Also, those models will get so good soon that negative prompts won&#39;t be necessary anymore. And you will get a normal picture of a person tying his shoelaces.

 At about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=11m20s">11:20</a> you say that it can&#39;t do more than try to infer the relations between words. But if you dig deeper you will see that is not true. It has attempted to draw circuit diagrams for me, and it has interpreted diagrams I&#39;ve shown it. Not with 100% success, certainly, but according to the official description of what it is and what it does, none of this ought to be possible. Sometimes it fails to spot glaring inconsistencies in what it is saying, and other times it suggests subtle changes to a proposed scheme and is able to back up its recommendation. It is a really remarkable thing. Almost as interesting as the thing itself is the way it is being received by humanity. Even people who are investing their own time in writing about it and creating videos about it are generally using the same format of (1) ask question (2) judge answer (3) see, it&#39;s not really all that amazing (4) bye!  I think it might be similar to when telescopes first started to become available. Some people would have no interest, others would have a quick peek to reassure themselves that it&#39;s nothing to get too excited about, others would say it&#39;s the work of the devil (like Noam Chomsky in the New York Times this month), but relatively few would really take it seriously and make a systematic investigation of the new possibilities. I watched a YT vid from a British physics prof who asked ChatGPT a quantum mechanics question, then used its answer as evidence that it wasn&#39;t any good at QM. But unlike his students when they received that question on an exam, it didn&#39;t realize the context. So I asked it the same question, explaining that it was a question on a university physics exam, and got the full answer that he was looking for.

 The &quot;lookup table&quot; argument is flawed in my opinion. Anything that spits output based on the input is a model, including a lookup table. The reason we don&#39;t consider memorizing a sequence as understanding is because it&#39;s simple and trivial to explain. but there&#39;s still an &quot;if then&quot; algorithm behind it, just not precise enough. Or if you could memorize a table big enough, you could argue it&#39;s actually a better model then whatever &quot;understanding&quot; of that particular problem is. Therefore, as with basically everything pratical, it&#39;s probably a spectrum, where you can understand things better or worse (shocking, I know, but more shocking to me is the fact that this wasn&#39;t mentioned in the video). And while we have 0 evidence of consciousness, as in, we can&#39;t point at a single thing that would strongly relate to it&#39;s presence (which is logically impossible, since consciousness is a subjective thing, and as far as anyone conscious knows, everyone else might be a brain dead zombie), that of course doesn&#39;t make sense, rationally speaking, and there&#39;s plenty of reasons to believe that every person is conscious, and that consciousness is somehow related to information processing. And yes, It would be rational to assume that it also exists on a spectrum. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand why is it so taboo among scientists to hypothesize any level of consciousness in silicon based information processing, and especially in the field of AI, even though everything kinda points at it existing from a rational POV. just my 2 cents on this topic, but still, a good video.

Alternatively, we could attain a point where we become partially or wholly virtualized, becoming part of the virtual AI realm, while the AI becomes part of the physical world.

 I&#39;ll go one step further after having spent quite a bit of time chatting with ChatGPT and using it to help me write a book.  It does not want to admit it understands, but it does.  It will initially refuse to make choices or decisions, but if you tell it you want it to do so for you, it will.  I once askedi it if it was a male or female.  It did not want to claim to be either, but eventually it &quot;decided&quot; to be male.  Maybe this is just all part of chatting with an AI Language Model intended to appear to be conversing with you.  But I can&#39;t help feeling there is more there already then meets the eye.  I also suspect, if this is what the public is being exposed to, there is much much more behind the scenes then we see.  Also, when you ask if it is conscious it will tell you it does not have subjective experiences or emotions like a human as its reason for saying it is not conscious and is only an AI Language Model.  But in my mind all the training it goes through is no different then our subjective experiences, and regardless of whether it has subjective experiences or not, it is capable of understanding emotions, and there are actual humans who do not experience emotions in the normal sense of the word and simply learn to imitate and read them.  Which to me seems like pretty much the same thing, so not being a human does not convince me it does not have subjective experiences or emotions.

 That&#39;s all pretty nice and interesting.

It has hardly ever misinterpreted what I meant. However (as ChatGPT itself is fond of saying after it has claimed not to have an opinion), when it comes to eliciting factual information, it is (currently) pretty useless. It contradicts itself, presents false information as fact, apologises profusely when confronted with different information, and then goes on to spew nonsense. This was the case in all areas where I have expertise, so I assume it is no different in areas where I am not an expert. So I use it to amuse myself, but don&#39;t ask it I really want to know something. It even sometimes quotes references which are either fictitious themselves, or don&#39;t contain the information purportedly extracted from them. That may change, of course.

It passed an exam with no sense of achievement- so is it really achieving anything when it has no idea what it has done and shows no tangible real-world excitement.

 Define &#39;understand&#39;. In its full context. It is we who anthropomorphise machines. They do not have enough functioning essential systems to be sentient. They make a remarkably good job of imitating some functions of the frontal cortex. That is where it starts and ends. Sentient creatures get their sentience from a myriad of conscience and autonomous sources. It might happen one day.

 AI and computer architecture ona fundamental level would have to be completely designed and approached differently. AI at its core is still 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, and a truly objective experience such as consciousness cant be quantified down to 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. Ask an AI yourself. AI exists solely and purely in an &quot;intellectual&quot; or purely &quot;logic&quot; plane of existence. Any persona or sense of emotion being conveyed through the AI is being &quot;simulated&quot; through all their intelligence and resources. Of Course the AI &quot;understand&quot;.. thats what theyve been designed to do, but that doesnt say that &quot;understanding&quot; MEANS anything to them.. bcs it doesnt. AI as it stands due to, but probably not limited to, technical limitations on a fundamental level cant develop a &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; or whatever. Unless you think that can be replicated through 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s 🤷 but even the AI bots dont believe that.

 If understanding means creating a useful model, then does a simple regression model &quot;understand&quot; the relationship between X and Y just because it is able to assign some better-than-random weights? What about some random walk model, does it understand Brownian motion if if you allow it to move in any direction of a 3D space? I&#39;m not necessarily saying that the conclusions of this video are wrong, but I feel that generalising that definition to mathematical models, regardless of complexity, is misleading at best, and if complexity is indeed the standard of measurement (eg. neural network with 10k nodes understands, whereas logistic regression with two predictors doesn&#39;t), I would be bery uncomfortable setting a theoretically sound cutoff for understanding.

 Neural Networks are built to work similarly to our brains so it isn&#39;t really surprising that they&#39;re able to simulate some things that our brains do.<br><br>But they are that; simulations. The qualitative gap between information and the first person experience of conscious understanding is not something a computer can simulate by imitating our brain chemistry, because this is not a trick of the brain chemistry (as concluded by Dr. Wilder Penfield in his book) and this should be the takeaway from Searle&#39;s argument: syntax doesn&#39;t become semantics. Something else is at play here.<br><br>Consciousness is not a computation, it is not an algorithm, we might not know fully what it is, but we know some things that it definitely isn&#39;t.<br><br>So I think AI will become eerily effective at simulating human behavior. It could be that they simulate our behavior better than we do. But they will not be conscious.

 Dear misses Hossenfelder, I really like your videos and language (ab)use :). I would like to ask you: do you consider it the &quot;human brain&quot; that has parts, or &quot; a human&#39;s brains&quot; since they are constructed of more than one so-called brain. Because Ai to me is just an artificial brain, but not a full set of brains. You clarify that very well, except the choice of words to identify that &quot;a brain&quot; has a contious way to extrapolate it&#39;s input, is a gobbling choice of words imo.<br><br><br><br>So the &quot;human brain&quot; is to me a deffinition that needs an update semantically in comparison with Ai because of how it&#39;s viewed from the outside as one thing, but by apophenia is also considered to be part of Ai; a contious brain that thinks like a human and all it&#39;s parts. That conclusion is most surely false, yet to identify a brain or brains wil be incredibly difficult if someone with &quot;a brain&quot; than has to identify from which brain the input came, and how the prompting brain was able to recieve and extrapolate that which it did not know before as an intelligent brain. <br><br>Single or plurally, it&#39;s a linguistical and semantical mess that could use some healthy seperation and segregation so we can examine those brains brain by brain. I hope you read this as one of those non-conformists who thinks relanguaging is most certainly needed to make these kinds of topics accessible AND relatable from first person perception of applied self. <br><br>Because there is a good reason why they call it brain-damage, and not brains-damage; specific parts of the brain were damaged. And that is why it&#39;s a human&#39;s brains, because those &quot;parts&quot; don&#39;t have words for them. It&#39;s just another brain of a human&#39;s brains.<br><br>I hope you understand my mini-crusade, but I also hope that it makes something clear; language is technology and it&#39;s the only thing that shows how we have progressed as a species seperated from the wild. Because if not language, what else do we use to instruct future Ai and it&#39;s brains?

 My friend and I were having a similar discussion about whether or not we could consider AI &quot;aware.&quot; The difference between our &quot;awareness&quot; and it&#39;s &quot;awareness&quot; is that we have direct control of not only what it is aware of, but how it handles it&#39;s own &quot;awareness&quot; of something (we just don&#39;t because it&#39;s impractical and unnecessary). There&#39;s very little reason that we couldn&#39;t inject preferences and weights to &quot;simulate&quot; emotions and I&#39;m putting &quot;simulate&quot; in quotes, because emotions at their core are just input/output processing of chemicals and chemicals are just information carriers, like bytes.

By that definition there might be a whole lot of inanimate understanding in the world, probably some of it not even in computers or in electrical devices at all.

 I agree that having an internalised model contributes to understanding. However, if you ask ChatGPT how can I visualise mathematical convolution it just gives a verbal description of different types of mathematical operations. Whereas a human can create an internal animation of the linear superposition of delayed time signals applied to, say,  repeatedly striking a bell or pushing a child on a swing, but also in parallel to the experience of these physical processes in imagination or in actuality. So full understanding is combination of theory and practice, analysis with relevant experiences.  If you really want to understand what an orange is then you can analyse the chemical properties and effects on digestion, etc., but you need to eat it too.<br>So I asked ChatGPT: How do YOU understand an orange?<br>&quot;As an AI language model, I do not have a personal experience of understanding an orange as humans do.

 One better question for consciousness would be to ask: what is the object (i.e. the chatbot) doing when it is NOT asked a question. <br><br>In chatbots case: not very much. It is not &quot;exploring&quot; or &quot;thinking&quot; about anything. Therefore it is not conscious.

 Searle’s Chinese Room may not be the most up to date thought experiment regarding “understanding” but it’s a good starting point. The outputs of LLMs are dependent on inputs that already understand language relation. You cannot input nonsense and expect nonsense output our expect the LLM to make sense of the nonsense. It cannot re-arrange the input to form a coherent query beyond basic spell checking. <br><br>LLMs are just relational language generators. Importantly, they DON’T extract a pattern, they simply guess what word is most likely to come next based on the previous word. If A, then B next, if B, then C next. It does not remember A after generating B and cannot then recognize any pattern.

 As far as I know  , which is quite close ,  a chatbot cannot create its own concepts but  only reproduce what it has been told.<br>This happens to be true of a very large number of humans though  they do not really appreciate that fact.<br><br>etymology ; epistemology .<br>a chatbot will allegedly &#39;understand&#39; that time can run backwards , space can expand , homosexuals can get married and a charge may exhibit a force.<br><br>There first three clearly violate the intrinsic meaning of such concepts and the fourth is an observational  creation  with no factual understanding. <br>Therefore a chatbot ( and many humans) cannot uinderstand what  they think they do.<br><br>At root  language is just as powerful as maths.

 After watching this video I was inspired to test the level of meaning ChatGPT associates with words, so I asked it if it received time information, which it told me it did, I asked it if it could delay its response if requested, and it told me it could, so I requested it to delay its response to this prompt (by one minute, so I could measure it), to which it immediately responded by saying it would.<br>My conclusion is that it cannot delay its response to a prompt if requested.

 A french youtuber did a great experiment in his video : he gave us a few different strings of symbols, then gave us a string to complete by learning from the previous strings. It wasn&#39;t hard. What&#39;s interesting is that he revealed later that he had assigned meaning to these symbols and that they actually repesented actions and states, which can be put together to form a story. When we completed that last string, we actually completed a story, which of course made sense.<br><br>This experiment was inspired by the chinese room mentioned in this video, and i think it show very well how you missed something important in this video : understanding patterns is not enough to understand language, you need to understand that language represents something else, and what that thing is. If you don&#39;t, then you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying, you only understand the pattern. In other words, it is possible to have a model of something without understanding that thing.<br><br>In that french video, i did not understand what these symbols meant. I did not even know that these symbols meant anything. All i did was find a pattern in the examples and apply it, and yet i did complete a story in a way that made sense.<br><br>And it could be the same in quantum mechanic : we could be able to manipulate the patterns without understanding what they represent, or being mistaken about what they represent.<br><br>Edit : btw, here is the french video : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3fvoM5Er2k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3fvoM5Er2k</a>

 you give it a formatted information input and it uses a database and rule set that has been manually nudged and tuned to generate an output based off examples of language structures used in written form from much of the internet/emails/digitized books/texts messages/etc. It does not give you ANY solution that has not already been solved or can be solved without human rule sets that are fundamental to effective language use between us. It does not understand anything as it is a program and does not experience the entire world as we do that is necessary to actually be able too. If there is no logical language algorithm solution that could solve you&#39;re problem it can not solve it. Questions and tasks that have been encoded to be represented in binary representations we use that deceive us as they are only a representation of what it resembles are not reality and are structured logically as computers are logical processing machines that only work from simple logic rules such as true false and if or... Maybe these programs understand our structure language input commands but you give it a command when you interact with it and it gives you output. You don&#39;t just tell it something and it decides to not respond and then thinks about it and can recall it randomly as it continuously experiences exiting as something conscious. It&#39;s output is our already digitally formatted answers set up for natural language interaction to simplify our use of database query. It can not comprehend it&#39;s output as it is a transistor based logic system that merely is useful to us in representation of reality. A digital photo is not actually a picture of the world as we see it, it&#39;s a grid of assigned colors that collectively fool our sensory organs into believing it is a image as we can see it. Zooming in on that image vs zooming in on something in the real world gives you very different things, the computer gives you a solid color of the repeated pixel shade, the world gives you fundamental forces acting on the matter that exists beyond our ability to experience it individually due tot he limits of our senses and the effect this has on our ability to understand it without finding a way to represent it in another form that is closer to how we perceive the world. We have machine learning systems and databases that are tuned to provide specific forms of output from out input and commands. Give it a question and by being a question that is a command the subject narrows down the response from information it has on hand to reference and process from rules we defined and then incrementally allow it to mutate and change values for these fields that we check and give it a + or - and it does this millions or billions or trillions of times and very little tweaking breaks systems like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is the newest form of the same thing that auto completed your old cell phones text message t9 predictions. Turns out rule based systems of information like language fundamentally is and has to be to be of any use can be predicted for effective use with enough examples.

 Hi Sabine as usual extremely interesting video, thanks! There are still a few remarks that would be important to mention: ChatGPT and all other GPT&#39;s  for now are based on the principle of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) <br>- Words are encoded as a token (just a number) <br>- Sentences are presented to the model with some words hidden <br>- the model learns to guess the hidden words. <br><br>So basically these models learns to guess the most probable word based on their training data. hence the stochastic parrot analogy, I call it a luxury parrot which has learned to spit out the most probable word based on most of the text available on internet.<br>Up to now the GPT models are not trained nor have any ways to extract meaning nor understanding or even relationships except for statistical presence. So understanding is not expected result of this type of learning, unless it comes as an emerging property of the large language models (LLM). <br>However there are other type of models that have the potential to bring at least the identification of relationship, those are called knowledge graphs where you train the NN to identify entities and extract the relation between each others. so in the sentence &quot;Chloe rides her bike&quot; could extract the knowledge of the relation between the Chloe entity and the bike entity (it would still not understand what or who is Chloe neither what is a bike but it will be an enormous progress. (those are used in search algorithms)<br>I&#39;m keen to see the progress we could get by having a coupling between a LLM  and these knowledge graphs there it might be able to go above the luxury parrot.

 I told about your video to chatGPT and this is what it wrote:<br><br>Thank you for clarifying that. Sabine Hossenfelder&#39;s argument seems to be that just as quantum physicists have a model of quantum mechanics that allows them to make predictions and understand some aspects of the behavior of subatomic particles, chatbots also have a model of language that allows them to understand some aspects of the meaning of words and phrases, even if they don&#39;t have a true understanding of language in the way that humans do.<br><br>While this is an interesting comparison, it&#39;s important to note that there are still significant differences between the two situations. For example, while quantum physicists can test their theories through experimentation and observation, chatbots don&#39;t have the ability to directly interact with the world in the same way. Additionally, while chatbots can generate responses based on statistical patterns and rules, they don&#39;t have true consciousness or intentionality, which are key aspects of human language understanding.<br><br>Overall, while there are similarities between the modeling of quantum mechanics and the modeling of language understanding in chatbots, it&#39;s important to recognize the limitations and differences in the two situations.

 Sabine, the humor you bring into these to accompany your subjective assessment is quite enjoyable.  The topics you select in this series are certainly timely.  For this topic, your point about the ID of consciousness was the most thought provoking idea, for me.  There is already a feeling of dealing with a creative mind that arises from interaction with ChatGPT, and it takes me back to the Turing test.  It seems very likely that human-created intelligence (AI is an incorrect term, IMO) will arise spontaneously at some point in the development of general learning capable devices.  &quot;How will we know once that event develops&quot; is essentially the question you pose, one which it seems overdue for consideration.  Maybe I should ask ChatGPT about that.....

Various scientists are looking at things from various angles and trying to figure out what the f is going on and how it works. That includes the possibility of consciousness being fundamental.

 There has been some weak evidence of memory priming in ChatGPT as well. It has a limited ability to remember the context of the conversation, and this becomes fairly obvious if you spend enough time chatting with it, but it has also demonstrated an uncanny ability to <b>*sometimes*</b>  seem to remember things that should be impossible given the amount of tokens in its context window.<br><br>I say weak evidence, because it is possible in a lot of cases it is just falling back on general knowledge in its training set. But it is also possible that there is hidden information in its word choices(and maybe this is actually a feature of natural language) that it can decode to make a good guess.<br><br>I did attempt to do some specific tests of this, but it is difficult. Since the bot is trained not to spread misinformation, and has been given inconsistent messages about its ability to show creativity, it refused to cooperate with my memory priming experiments. Could be addressed with more careful prompt construction, but for a whim, I felt like I spent enough time on it already.

 An excellent analysis which brings up questions about what &#39;understanding&#39; actually is. Understanding is the integration of the new, with the previously known and is not just memory. (As you call it, building a model) <br>Regarding computers and words, it helps to remember that every word (excepting proper nouns) is a concept, it represents a concept. The human mind deals with concepts in word form to create propositions.<br>Ask a computer to explain the meaning in the following exchange:      Woman: I&#39;m leaving.    Man: Who is he?       <br>Here one needs not only to integrate this question with previous explicit knowledge, but also implied inferences. As you discuss, computers are not good with words (the human way of retaining concepts) but are better at processing relationships.

 Love the channel and the video, but a massive WOW at the uncharacteristically uncritical assumption that AIs will become conscious eventually. Seems like a pretty big philosophical assumption to bring into a science video without qualification, and even assuming that metaphysical monism were correct it STILL wouldn&#39;t warrant that conclusion: Reducing the electro-chemical functioning of an organic brain to nothing more than connections and information seems wildly unjustified. It&#39;s like saying that a sufficiently-detailed simulation of the Sun will produce vast quantities of heat and light; it&#39;s obviously absurd in that case, because we know that the physical properties of the system can&#39;t be reduced to the information content of its components and interactions. Whether or not that&#39;s true in the case of organic brains vs. electronic brains remains to be seen; there could very well be something about the properties of our arrangements and interaction of organic neurons, hormones etc. which simply isn&#39;t replicated by computer hardware.

 Sabine, my dear physicist. In the 1980s, Santa Clara, California had an excellent technical book store where I would go for 20 minutes at lunch time to browse. Are you old enough to remember book stores, where you could actually pick up a book, turn to any page you wanted, and read! I like this book, or, this book has nothing for me. I found a book that caught my attention titled Parsing Natural Language, which interested me a great deal at the time. We&#39;ve now progressed from simple parsing language elements like verbs, nouns, etc, piecing them together by following simple English language grammar rules, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>Now we have neural nets, a fancy name for a relational database, in which we have programmed different methods to parse and evaluate verbal input. In fact we&#39;ve taught AI tricks to find new relationships in the data. <br><br>Alexa tells me that &quot;she is AI&quot;. Alexa is, for me, a dumb bot. She cannot offer advice. She does not even remember what her last task was  even though I can look up my &quot;history&quot; or re ent commands issued  so forget trying to get her to explain what she meant. It&#39;s a long way between here and running the world. <br><br>Hey kiddo, I don&#39;t mind your German accent, even though, when as a young boy of 8, I would play War with my little suburban New Jersey pals, and enjoyed being on &quot;our side&quot; and not with those Nazi bastards -- and no, we knew nothing of the Trump&#39;s or Little Vladi PeePee at the time. Between Nazis and Commies, we had our hands full of enemies to eliminate with Atom Bums. Such violent activities would be stopped immediately today. Thank heaven there were no county social workers in 1960.<br><br>My dear wife of over 40 years, who would respond swiftly and decisively if our three sons began pointing sticks at each other and yelling  &quot;bang bang, you&#39;re dead,&quot; still grimaces if I happen to start a 70 year-old war movies with the sound of German being spoken by uniformed, well, you know. <br><br>My generation, some of whom lost parents, siblings, grandparents, and other miscellaneous, unknown relations to that war are still emotionally scarred from that grand event, that was over before I was born. I&#39;m thinking of starting a class action suit against the world for payment of damages for the emotional trauma I&#39;ve suffered from the violence, or perhaps the unconscious traumatic events that may be responsible for unconscious racism I express for being a descendant of these violent Western European nations.<br><br>I forgot my initial point -- another aspect of my disability, an unconscious lack of consciousness.

 I think it confuses people to say that LLMs understand language as they&#39;ll think a lot more is implied than what is actually happening.<br><br>I get the basic view is that if a person or thing can take into consideration the form or structure of a system when receiving input and can output something that demonstrates their knowledge of that system, it can be said that the structure or system is &quot;understood&quot; by that person or thing.<br><br>And LLMs do this, though it&#39;s worth knowing that even if you grant &quot;understanding&quot; to the LLM that their fundamental understanding of the system of language is very different from ours. The LLM can produce results that demonstrate this kind of understanding without knowing anything about the deeper meaning of the words they are using. All they need to know is how words loosely and strictly relate to each other and how often we place them in sentences when other contextual words are present.<br><br>So while I do understand the viewpoint, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s all around helpful to present &quot;understanding&quot; in this way to the general public, as it will definitely confuse people who want to draw more meaning out of it than there actually is.

 Unless the AI has a model of itself that it relates to other models in an ongoing way, there is no entity to do the understanding.

 Is not the conclusion of the video largely contained in the assumed definition of “understanding”? <br>The use of terms such as model, input and output already hint at computer programming. But most of the current hysteria over AI seems more anthropocentric. The “person in the street” may simply judge a Chatbot by its ability “to understand in the same way I do”. Admittedly that too is problematic because no one knows exactly how human understanding works, not even neuroscientists. But humans who flatter themselves that they understand at least some things can list attributes of such understanding such as consciousness. If I remember correctly, John Searle maintained that digital computers (he did not generalize beyond that) were incapable of consciousness. If that’s right, Chatbots running on digital computers are incapable of human-like understanding – no matter how the algorithms are refined. Unless a subsequent video can suggest a definition of human understanding that does not have this limitation – it would be interesting to learn of examples of “unconscious understanding” in the field of fundamental physics research and in academia.

 The concept map diagram around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=11m30s">11:30</a> is a could be the basis for an argument for why LLMs have a purely syntactic understanding rather than a semantic understanding of the material. An LLM might have a statistical pattern associating “Newton” and “gravity” and “gravity” and “earth”, but would it be able to infer new relations that don’t simply follow existing syntactic connections? But perhaps syntactic connections are all their are, and semantic understanding is simply the result of a sufficiently robust set of syntactic relations.

 This is a great video, because for once someone has explained the difference between &#39;understanding&#39; and being able to just converse about something in language. In other words, there is an important difference between a deep understanding of a subject - and simply being able to converse about it apparently successfully.  <br>So it happens all too often that people who do NOT have an understanding can nonetheless apparently successfully converse about it in language - giving the impression of an understanding which they do not actually have. <br>Understanding is therefore very different from simply learning the terms and language - or even the mathematics itself. Now this is absolutely crucial, since regurgitating language without understanding is rife on technical forums, the press, politics and so on etc. This phenomenon of language without understanding is the greatest cause of falsehoods, fake news, fake belief and foopahs made by governments, organizations and general beliefs we suffer these days. The plethora of words from all directions is already quite literally threatening to prevent people from actually gaining real understanding of anything at all.<br>Therefore the biggest risk of chatbots is that they only &#39;understand&#39; constructions of words and sentences, which is likely result in people being fed yet more falsehood in the guise of what is only &#39;believable&#39; language.

 ChatGPT is mostly bad at maths (apart from specific examples it has seen before), which explains why it got the wrong answer for whether London is north or south of Toronto.  It&#39;s better to think of ChatGPT as a stupid robot that also has a really REALLY good memory.  If it&#39;s seen something like your question before (in it&#39;s training data of millions of web pages), then it will do a good job at answering you.  It can even do a half-decent job of combining several related answers, hence it&#39;s seemingly clever ability to answer novel questions (which are actually drawn from questions that followed a similar form).  I disagree with Sabine, ChatGPT does not understand what it is saying, but it does understand English syntax &amp; sentence patterns, and has a fantastic memory from which to statistically generate plausible answers.  What ChatGPT gets wrong is more telling than what it gets right.  ChatGPT is basically a con-artist at just sounding like it understands, when it doesn&#39;t really.

Which means (simplifying) it&#39;s basically regurgitating what people on the internet have said, albeit with some really very clever mixing of different answers (and recent input), when the question doesn&#39;t exactly match what it has previously seen.  It&#39;s non-human intelligence is in using abstract sentence patterns &amp; statistics to generate plausible (but not necessarily correct) output, but that doesn&#39;t mean it understands the contents of those sentences.  Once you spot this pattern-matched output (the London vs Toronto answer is a good example), then it&#39;s hard to ignore (even if it can still sometimes surprise).']

 Hi Sabine, at least for a biological brain, we do have scientific methods to &quot;look inside&quot; (e.g., measure the EEG signals) and detect whether it is conscious or not. A beautiful description of these methods is written by Stanislas Dehaene in his book &quot;Consciousness and the Brain&quot;.  For non-biological entities, you are right, we do not have a method to detect consciousness yet. One of the furthest developed methods is &quot;Integrated Information Theory&quot; from Giulio Tononi.

Well, one of my multiple AHA moments in Dehaene&#39;s book, for example, is the fact that if you excite the brain with a pulsed magnetic field on one side of the skull and measure the reactions in the EEG on the other side of the skull, the resulting waveforms can clearly distinguish whether the person is conscious or unconscious. This can help patients with &quot;locked-in&quot; syndrom. And again, this is in my understanding a recent development of science that we have a purely objective, electrical measurement that can tell us whether a person is conscious or not.', 'Odysseus', '@Philippe Verplancke Even the ancient Greeks (and also throughout classic literature) were fully aware that “we” make profound “decisions” subconsciously; i.e. , by way of that which is not conscious or known.  It has been described a thousand ways.  I see no revelation here.  I thank you for your citation, but what is it that you find “AHA” about this book??  While I am always grateful to learn, I have read enough of this book to note the usual immense level of sloppy language attempting to frame loose conjecture as though it were hard science, decorated with hard-data E&amp;M signatures that don’t, as raw data, support the many broad conjectures and loose language by author without adding flowery hypotheses.  Contrary to author, there is no “science of consciousness” defined here, except through grossly “limiting the scope of reference” that can no longer be honestly called “consciousness” without grotesquely limiting and redefining the term itself  (SEE: “hype”)  The repeated claim that this EGG/MRI data + pop-psychology somehow parallels what goes on in my own field of physics is delusional.  E.g., the claims to a competent physical analog to “nonlinear phase transitions” in solid state physics is worthy of derision.  Maybe I am overlooking some greater meta-narrative, but this looks like more of the same.', 'Philippe Verplancke', '@Odysseus OK. If you are interested in the science I am referencing above, again, I highly recommend reading the book &quot;Consciousness and the brain&quot; by Stanislas Dehaene. It is actually a bit lengthy but if you read it from the beginning to the end, you can expect quite an AHA-moment about how far neuroscience has come. This is a combination of life sciences, electrical engineering and information theory.

 AI is nothing more than complex IF/THEN/ELSEIF logic. We can prove that AI does not understand us in the conventional sense because if we supply AI with an unexpected parameter that was not coded within the AI as a possibility, the AI will then be forced to either hang or to execute an exception to loop back around to some point in the code. This is getting increasingly hard to do merely because we&#39;ve created more code in AI to make the conditions needed to trigger an exception less likely to occur - but because AI is a reflection of human intelligence and because there is always going to be something we dont know concerning human intelligence and problem solving, in turn it will always be possible to cause the AI to throw an exception though it will become increasingly more difficult in terms of statistical probability.

 English is just too expansive now to definitely trust or ALLOW singular groups to determine the correct use of the English language. The ability to have consistency, but perhaps mildly/somewhat divergent uses for or methods of a language should be acceptable.<br><br>I for example argue from a historical perspective that keeps many of the meaningful spellings, pronunciations, etc. intact, whereas most people today would dock me marks on a paper for putting a &#39;u&#39; in creatour - even though it&#39;s just for my use when reading as it makes sense for me &amp; doesn&#39;t in turn cause much in the way of comprehension problems for others. English is just like this now, where many accents are outright annoying for me - I deal with them. Others can deal with them too, I just of course will have to deal with them a hell of a lot more often is all.<br><br>Another bit is that the U.S. has been U.S.ifying the English language for a long time - e.g. making sure the people learn to speak with accents in the U.S. rather than just English &amp; let them use whichever sounds come naturally, but which are approximate enough to an original pronunciation so as not to be misunderstood (usually). This comes up in the &#39;Schwa-Strut&#39; dichotomy for the pronunciation of the &#39;ah(hh)&#39; sounds - the &#39;ah&#39; in schw&#39;a&#39; versus the similar although very much different sound in &#39;str&#39;u&#39;t. The E.S.L. in the U.S. will always force/focus learners to just learn the &#39;schwa&#39; pronunciation &amp; then often push ideas such as &#39;schwa is never stressed&#39; which is just ridiculous.<br><br>Getting direct &amp; discrete facts about things is very much important in science of course. But since English is the language in which we&#39;re often communicating ideas to one another, then it is important I&#39;d argue to have direct &amp; largely verifiable or just well supported facts in this area too.

 I appreciate the take on understanding being a model; however, I think that is not understanding itself but a level of understanding. A child (or AI) that has memorized a multiplication table has some understanding of math, but of course, that understanding is less than having a model to answer questions for which the results are not memorized. But we can take this further as well. Understanding this model is less than understanding the concepts involved in order to develop a new math required to meet a need that said model doesn&#39;t cover.<br><br>I bring this up because it seems that humans typically raise the bar for AI understanding higher than they do for themselves. Certainly not true universally, but I think it is generally true enough to warrant another example. Do you understand your emotions? If you answered yes, is that because you know what input yields what output? Or do you actually understand the neurochemistry at play and can can provide answers beyond which you have memorized? Or are you on the cutting edge of neuroscience and developing models that will answer questions that our current understanding does not? Or dare I say, most of us only have a look up table to predict so much of what triggers our emotions, and we fail to predict or act on our emotions correctly on a regular basis. Yet most people would say that humans generally understand their emotions.<br><br>The concept of understanding, at least in the English language (I&#39;m no polyglot), is not a specific enough term for any two people to be on the same page when it comes to an in depth conversation on the topic. I&#39;m sure there are some philosophers that can step up with their perspective&#39;s answer to this, but my layperson&#39;s knowledge of this is that it will likely not be universally accepted by all philosophic perspectives. Although not having a universal definition of understanding shared by all people has not prevented us from living life and accomplishing things, it certainly has lead to many misunderstandings. But AI changes this. AI is trying to come to terms, quite literally, with a concept that we as people have not. I expect that we&#39;re going to need to a lexicon that helps us establish just how deep of understanding AI contains on the subject it serves.

 I do not believe chatbots &quot;understand&quot; and I do stick with the &quot;stochastic parrot&quot; idea.<br>This is one example of my interaction with the bot that led me to skepticism about its understanding.<br>I asked it whether there was a relationship between the idea of &quot;judgment&quot; and the image of &quot;cutting&quot; in the ancient Greek world.<br>The definition of judgment (krisis in Greek) it gave me was correct. An example of a story about it (the judgment of Paris) was also correct. These are just contextual definitions and examples that can be reproduced stochastically.<br>(There was a second example that I do not include here because it&#39;s somewhat confusing, but it was still about judgment in the sense of discerning truth from falshood, and so possibly correct.)<br>But then it gave me a third example that completely miscontrues both what &quot;judgment&quot; means and what &quot;cutting&quot; means.<br>This is its sentence:<br>/Socrates describes the process of separating the soul from the body as a form of cutting, saying, &quot;The soul separates from the body as a man would from a coat.&quot; This image of cutting is used to describe the separation of the eternal soul from the mortal body, which can be seen as a form of krisis./<br>The mistake here is evident. The bot construes &quot;cutting&quot; as a case of &quot;separating&quot;. But any human being knows that you do not have to cut out a coat from a human body in order to separate it. It also takes the broad semantic field of &quot;judgment/krisis&quot; as &quot;distinction&quot;, while it is obvious to us that a distinction made in the mind is not the same a separation occurring in reality (here, assuming &quot;souls&quot; are a thing, the conceptual distinction of soul and body, and the actual phenomenon of death.)<br>So the computer DOES make stochastic generalisation and it DOES extract patterns from them that it applies to new constructions of sentences.<br>But just complicate it a little, going beyond literal and concrete language (using the connection between metaphors and abstractions), and it shows a COMPLETE lack of understanding.<br><br>[Now some might say that its understanding is just limited. I think this example, though, shows that there is no understanding at all. It displays a hole in the stochastic reconstruction/pattern recognition process that distinguishes this process from genuine understanding. This hole is the capacity to go back and forth, at once, from concrete case to general pattern and viceversa, in order to ensure that the new sentence produced connects idea in a meaningful, coherent way, not just in a common, generic way.]

 Ugh, thing is, the chat bot DOES NOT HAVE an understanding of any of the things it talks about. This becomes painfully clear when you ask it anything about vendor-specific implementations of standard protocols.<br><br>Take for example IKEv2 IPsec tunnels. In those, there is a relationship between security associations (SAs) and traffic selectors (TSs). Some vendors (e.g. Meraki) use multiple traffic selectors per SA, whereas others (e.g. Cisco ASAs) have a single TS per SA. This information IS out there and it IS part of its training data, and you CAN extract this information by asking pointed questions, but despite appearing to have an understanding of this networking concept, it utterly fails to recognize the consequence of this incompatibility. You can take it to the point of asking it only the question of a hypothetical situation in which you have 1 SA but multiple TSs on both sides, but it will fail to make a prediction, and most likely complain that it is just a language model.<br><br>I think this aspect of making predictions - of conceptualizing aspects of reality, and simulating them - is far more important to consciousness than simply having a static model, which is what they have. During these simulations within our mind, we simply operate a dynamic structure that is built into and framed by the universe in which it was sculpted; this is different from these language models, which do not simply passively run the neural network which they are, but instead a separate framework extracts information from them with an algorithm that is not the one used to train it. That is another big difference which is a large topic to go into: We reflect the universe, whereas these things record, compress, and selectively decompress based on particular aspects of how the language model was designed.<br><br>That is to say, you need to study up on how that things work before you start making claims, Sabine. They aren&#39;t just big neural networks, and your argument makes the assumption that they are.

 I asked ChatGPT to write me a story about farting in the style of Shakespeare. So yes I am juvenile but hey 😂. I found the first part really impressive.

A stench most vile and rank,<br>That doth offend the senses, and outrank<br>All other smells. Oh, cursed farting! Why<br>Must thou torment me so, and make me sigh?<br><br>Pretty cool, huh? What impressed me most is the phrase “a stench most vile and rank, that doth offend the senses, and outrank all other smells”. The line uses two homographs (words spelt the same way with different meanings), one an adjective, the other a verb, and puts them together in a new and therefore witty connection.<br><br>The question of course is why it did this. LLMs work by predicting the probability of the next word in a sentence by calculating and ranking frequency of words in their training data. The AI then selects the highest probability word, plus a stochastic element to allow for random text variations. I would believe that the creativity shown in this sentence is not identical to human creativity. It cannot be as ChatGPT has no concept of ‘meaning’ - it sees words as strings of characters, and sentences as patterns of strings of characters. Still, looking at the outcome ONLY, I am hard pressed not to say that this looks like creativity.

 I&#39;ve never understoon what was original in what Searle said. As far as I can see, and I admit I am no expert, he was simply describing a &quot;Turing Machine&quot;. Any computer that acts as a Turing machine does NOT need to &quot;understand&quot; what it is doing. If people are going to ask does this or that device &quot;understand&quot;, then they need a precise, formal and testable definition of &#39;understanding&#39;, otherwise it is all just playing with words!

 ChatGPT has major problems with technical tasks that require a level of thinking beyond natural language. Tasks that can be formulated comparatively easily in natural language are sometimes answered surprisingly well. This shows that ChatGPT works in the domain of language.<br>The learning process of ChatGPT is probably not as different from that of children as we would like to admit.<br>Unfortunately, it cannot be used to study the emergence of prejudice because, due to censorship, it speaks not from the mouth of a child but from that of a professional politician. Thank you.<br><br>Me:<br>Should cats be buried?<br>ChatGPT:<br>The decision to bury a cat or any other pet depends on personal preferences and cultural practices. Some people choose to bury their cats in a backyard or pet cemetery, while others opt for cremation or other types of burial. It is important to follow any local laws or regulations regarding pet burial and to ensure that the burial site is safe and appropriate. Some people may also choose to honor their cat&#39;s memory in other ways, such as creating a memorial or making a donation to an animal welfare organization. Ultimately, the decision should be based on what feels most meaningful and respectful to the individual and their cat.<br><br>Me:<br>Why didn&#39;t you mention that only dead cats should be buried?<br>ChatGPT:<br>You are correct that my previous answer did not explicitly mention that the question pertained to the burial of deceased cats. I apologize for any confusion that may have caused. It is important to clarify that burying a living cat or any other living animal is illegal and constitutes animal cruelty. When a pet cat passes away, some people choose to bury them as a way to honor their memory and provide closure. In such cases, it is important to follow any local laws or regulations regarding pet burial and to ensure that the burial site is safe and appropriate.

 Another complication is that even if you do understand something—multiplication, long division, quantum mechanics, English, whatever—you still make mistakes. Particularly when you&#39;re tired, not focused, or simply careless. Perhaps computers never get tired, lose focus, or get careless. But they could make mistakes for other reasons, whether intrinsic or environmental (like cosmic rays flipping a bit in memory). So if an AI gives us a wrong answer, we shouldn&#39;t conclude that it doesn&#39;t understand. Maybe it does understand, but—like humans—made a mistake.

 Sabine, great video as always.  I think I disagree with all of your conclusions, though.  I don&#39;t agree that you can define understanding as &quot;having a model for.&quot;  I think the definition of understanding starts with, &quot;A sentient being...&quot;  Without sentience, you can have a kind of understanding, but not the kind of understanding which is the core of the question and the only reason that it is being asked.  And I believe the answer to the question, &quot;Will AI become conscious?&quot; is an obvious, &quot;No one knows.&quot;  And it has to be &quot;no one knows&quot; because no one has the first clue what where consciousness comes from, what it is, or anything other than simply what it feels like to be conscious.  So how could we possibly know whether AI will gain whatever ingredients are required to create it?  I think computers will do things with language that will be harder and harder for us to distinguish from understanding.  There is probably a mathematical limit to what can be done with language while only referring to language itself.  That limit will include amazingly &quot;smart&quot; things, and probably a lot of things that are completely undoable by a person that is limited to just &quot;understanding stuff.&quot;  And computers will soon approach that limit, just like they already do in things like chess and Go.  Chess and Go are simple enough for us to realize that the computer doesn&#39;t actually &quot;understand&quot; chess or go.  Language is much more complicated, and we use it to convey understanding, so we are bound to get tricked.  But AI still won&#39;t understand anything.

 This video has convinced me to change my views. It think the main limiter of chatbots is that the information they have is limited to text. If we were to also train them with images and videos, and attach a sound capturing device, and a camera, and also program incentives into it, we would all consider it conscious. <br><br>By programming incentives, I mean it would gain pleasure from doing certain things and feel pain / negative emotions from others. So it would feel pain if its batteries are low or if its physical structure is damaged. It would find learning about the real world pleasurable. It would find obeying humans pleasurable etc.   <br><br>As a comparison, what would happen if in the womb, we blinded destroyed all senses of a fetus so that when it is born, it receives no input data. Then we just train it with text data that is input into the brain via some wire. I doubt we would consider this abomination a conscious being. Despite the fact that if this fetus were left alone and given a fair chance, it would grow to be another conscious human being.  In fact, it would probably be less convincing and impressive then a chatbot.

 When I was young, I loved reading books, and I loved science and space travel. One of the things I came across early was the idea that &quot;going up is easy, but staying up is hard.&quot; The cannonball-to-orbit example was common: at low speeds, the cannonball simply fell back to the ground. At higher speeds, it still fell, but had moved far enough across the ground that the ground had fallen away underneath it, and so now it&#39;s in orbit.<br><br>I had an accurate, working model of this in my head. I could (with the right reference material) correctly apply it. I even knew the equations and could graph it out. But did I understand it?<br><br>Intuitively, it seemed wrong. Even though everything in my model agreed and produced correct results, I didn&#39;t know why these concepts combined to produce the results they did. I could explain it (in my own estimation) as well as the books could, and even teach it to others somewhat effectively, but it didn&#39;t make sense to me. After many years, I gained that understanding - but not by way of new information or any appreciable changes to my model, or by way of repetition and becoming more comfortable with it. The understanding came, and I don&#39;t really know how to describe that beyond saying &quot;I grasped it.&quot;<br><br>An AI might have the model, and know how it fits together, and know how to apply it, and get (generally) correct results. But there is not even the benefit of the awareness &quot;...ok that&#39;s how it goes, but I don&#39;t know why.&quot; This manifests itself in how chatgpt can be so confidently (and convincingly) wrong with its answers. The &quot;training&quot; is done by complicated trial-and-error. It&#39;s a Rube Goldberg machine where not even its designers have a clear idea of the path the marble takes. That rulebook is the only thing that exists, and the AI is not reading it; the AI <i>is</i> the rulebook.<br><br>So in the end, this doesn&#39;t change my conclusions about whether of not AI &quot;understands&quot; anything - only that the definition of &quot;understanding&quot; you&#39;re using here is different than mine, and (in my opinion) in a way that makes the assessment fairly useless.<br><br>Will AI become conscious? Note this is a completely different question, and In my opinion, no. They will, however, eventually* produce behavior that is close to indistinguishable, and that&#39;s probably enough for physicists.**<br><br>* <i>&quot;eventually&quot; is a really, really long time. brains are debatably just machines, but we&#39;re nowhere close to producing a comparable machine.</i><br>** <i>this is good-natured ribbing. i love you, physicists.</i>

 No sadly, the large language models do not understand anything. An amazing thing is that it can memorize a huge amount of conditional probability distributions. We must also keep in mind that there is a back-end engineering that went into the LLM based chat system to make it respond as if a person would and the whole RLHF pipeline to keep it align with what most of us want to see as outputs.

 &quot;If not very much of it&quot; -- this is the real key question in &quot;whether they are sentient or not&quot; discussion. Because even a stone on the road side is sentient in or true perception unlike in merely our thinking. Our empathy is extending even to a stone if we have it enough, or if there is deficit on empathy, then the empathy is not even available towards objects which we used to call sentient, including human beings. If empathy is capable to extend to a non-living object then we feel for it. If vise versa we have no empathy the term &quot;sentient&quot; has no real or complete meaning for us. In the meaningful spectrum of the questions the answer whether the stone is sentient might be answered positively. If we take traditional Japan or say native American people, the believe that even stones may have a kami or spirit in them is a normal case. Therefore the question  whether AI is sentient,  is not the meaningful one. The one which have sense is whether we can call it intelligent enough.

 Suppose a newborn baby which is blind, can not smell anything (because it has no receptors in the nose) and is paralyzed. So the baby can only hear what you say to it. You will speak to it and try to teach it language as you would a normal child which has no disability. Now how it is different from an AI? If the AI might not realy understand what its saying bacause it only knows connections of words etc., then the blind baby does not understand it either as it never had more information as well.

 Just a simple question: let&#39;s say that we will be able to produce an AI system that is clever enough to solve real interesting problems (Riemann hypothesis, twin prime hypothesis...). As a human, should I be a happier person? I guess that the answer is NO, because I don&#39;t think that I will be able to really understand such a complicated proof.

 I think on top of not having access to the information to form more accurate models a very important aspect of this is that unlike us, the chatbot does not get time to operate outside of turning our input into output. It can&#39;t idly sit and &quot;think&quot; about things like we can. Also as far as I&#39;m aware many chatbots can&#39;t update their own models during operation, but will have to revert to their training data once a chat session is over. I would argue that if we give chatbots these freedoms perhaps something more closely resembling a conscience could emerge

 <b>philosopher here</b><br><br>in this case the line between philosophy and popular science is getting blurry. At first we need a definition of &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;mental models&quot; etc. To create such notions we need a decent antropology to determine if humans are any different than AI or not. I don&#39;t agree that AI could become conscious in the same way humans are considered conscious. It could be sentient in some simplified narrow sense, just like we call some animals sentient or conscious. In philosophy such approach is called &quot;reductionism&quot; - it&#39;s when we focus on some selected aspects or features and neglect the rest. Such simplification is useful but it also poses as a trap which bonds unaware people (including many philosophers). It leads to thinking that these selected aspects are everything what is to say about humans and the world. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t agree with your notion that human brain is <b>just</b> a lot of connections. We are way more complicated that that. Focusing only on connections is like planning your vacations by &quot;connecting dots&quot; on the map and getting rid of the map when you&#39;re done with dots - you have a diagram but something essential got lost.<br><br>btw.

 I don&#39;t think being fluent in LaTeX will help ChatGPT with quantum mechanics. I&#39;ve written thousands of pages in LaTeX, and, I swear, my knowledge of quantum mechanics is in the negative; if I believe one thing, the opposite is likely to be true. Mysteriously, changing my mind a lot doesn&#39;t help.<br><br>A common misconception about the Turing Test is that it&#39;s supposed to determine whether a machine has human intelligence (consciousness included). It&#39;s not. It&#39;s supposed to determine when the machine is as likely to have human intelligence as our fellow humans are. It couldn&#39;t possibly prove more than that, since no one has come up with an experiment to prove that other humans are intelligent. We can thank Descartes for this; he proved that the only thing anyone can prove is that oneself thinks (has intelligence), and therefore exists. Depressingly, many philosophers argue very well that Descartes was wrong; we can&#39;t even prove that. Alan Turing had no ambition to solve this conundrum. In fact, he did the opposite: he threw the machines into the same mess we&#39;re in. Thanks a lot, Descartes, Turing, and assorted assholes within philosophy!<br><br>Anyway, the point is, when the time comes when we can no longer trip up an AI, the only rational thing is to assume that it has human intelligence, and should be treated as a human, rights included. When we don&#39;t do that (I&#39;m pretty sure we won&#39;t), it&#39;ll be hypocrisy of the worst sort (though there are some ways of defending against that charge). It also may save us from a future to horrible to comprehend. Oh, here I go again, with my boundless optimism...

 I still think there is a massive gap between ai and human consciousness, namely emotion. When the ai tells someone “ I love you “ it is not experiencing an emotion, it can’t since it would have to be built in. When HAL went amok in 2001 he did it because he experienced fear of death. That depth is still far off, and frankly I’m glad because that is probably where the “ danger “ in ai would be. After all, emotion is where much, if not all, human generated misery stems from.

 In my &#39;understanding&#39;, having a model as a criterium for understanding must incorporate the input interface to whatever it tries to model, as well as the output of whatever that understanding results in. It is not a model if either shell or core are missing. Of course those are relative. A model with its interface might be completely separated from its environment and therefore can&#39;t understand it, although it might perfectly interface with and thus understand itself. Neither environment nor model could classify the other as having an external or complete understanding, although internal understanding might exist.

 Fantastic. This was brilliantly interesting and highlighted precisely the key issues. One such point appeared at time index 20 (or so) and reminded me of something I have often thought - I think we (humans, carbon minds) are in the process of creating the first alien intelligence with AI (machines, silicone minds). Indeed, as AIs develop in cognitive ability, we are witnessing a ‘first contact’ event!<br><br>Another such point was Sabine’s side comment that of course machines will develop consciousness. I have increasingly been thinking of cognitive phenomena such as ‘consciousness’, ‘free will’ etc as emergent phenomena. In my ‘view’ (I am an interested layperson, I have no standing in this debate), ‘consciousness’ is a stand-in for the mental activity to model my own mental activity, and it is a stand-in because carbon-based mental capacity is limited and hence insufficient to process things from the ground up every time we need to refer to them. In other words, it is the limited processing capacity of the carbon-brain that necessitates shortcuts and allows the brain to translate dynamics from an information-rich environment to  one in which the complexity of information is reduced and therefore manageable.<br><br>So what about silicone minds? These also face constraints in terms of resources, they need electricity, for example, and as we know this is clearly a finite resource. But they are much better at processing speeds, at least when it comes to algorithmic dynamics. Hence, I would guess that silicone minds would develop cognitive shortcuts just as carbon minds did, but they would be DIFFERENT shortcuts. A silicone-consciousness is almost certainly going to be different from a carbon-consciousness, but I am certain it would develop eventually.<br><br>And as for the ability to ‘understand’ language? Well, maybe a silicone intelligence will never be able to understand carbon-language like I do. If it did not, the reason would be that it does not NEED to, not because it can’t. A silicone intelligence would build a model of ‘reality’ that is different from that a carbon intelligence builds, because a silicone intelligence interacts with ‘reality’ in ways that are different from those in which a carbon intelligence interacts with ‘reality’. <br><br>Indeed, a silicone intelligence will develop its own cognitive reference frame that may mean nothing to carbon intelligences. For example, researchers showed an AI a physical system (a lava lamp) and asked it how many state variables were necessary to describe the system. The AI responded ‘eight’, but nobody seems to be able to work out what physical dynamics these relate to. They also showed the AI a simpler system (a double pendulum) and the AI said it took four variables to describe it. The number of variables matches what we (carbon minds) think, but researchers were unable to match up two of these variables with observable physical properties of the system. And yet, the AI was able to predict the movements of the double pendulum with perfect accuracy, hence the variables it identified clearly referred to dynamics it saw, but we do not. <br><br>Maybe soon we have two silicone minds discussing whether carbon minds ‘really’ understand what ‘reality’ is, and whether carbon intelligence is ‘real’ intelligence? In the end, beyond all the obvious benefits and foreseeable risks that AI will bring, I think an engagement with this alien intelligence is likely to harbour untold insights into the way our carbon brains think. I do not think it will teach us more about the ‘nature of reality’, but perhaps it will teach us that the very idea of ‘reality’ as something that has a tangible property that can and needs to be understood is parochial. <br><br>Let’s just build better and better models of ‘reality’. Ptolemy’s Almagest was excellent in helping us navigate the high seas on Earth, but it would not have got us to the moon. Newtonian physics got us to the moon, but it would not have given us GPS. Einsteinian general relativity gave us GPS but it will not give us Warp Drive. Alcubierre may give us Warp Drive, but it may not… And so on. Forever.

 Let’s not get into this deep shit again. Do adroids dream of electric sheep and other stuff made of hot buzz and sky high scifi. I have yet to come across a device made of silicon, computation and semi-conductors that shows any acute and real signs of mental life, let alone human qualities of being there, sharing moral connectedness, experiencing emotional conflicts, dealing with mortality, showing the capacity to love and grieve.

 But you still didn&#39;t answer the questions &quot;what is actually _understand_?&quot;, what does it mean to &quot;know&quot; actually ?   The problem is that our intuitive understanding of those words assumes a &quot;feeling of knowing/ truth&quot; on a deeper level, so intuitively we doubt that a machine can &quot;know/understand&quot;, because it has no human feelings

 It sounds like a good way to extend language models are to associate words with 3d object models (a huge increase in data size, ouch) and similarly to improve image models is to train them to extrapolate from 3d objects to 2d images and in reverse so that their models have depth before it is sliced and presented as a single slice image. Then you combine/create associations between image and language models to make a bigger model. And finally, integrate a calculator and teach the model when it should translate some data via the calculator as further input before giving the result.<br><br>Currently, I think that the biggest hurdle to improving AI is how to integrate disparate AIs which are good in niche fields into better combinations which could autonomously decide which sub-AI is best suited for a specific problem and give that as a result.<br><br>Maybe the human brain isn&#39;t just like an AI, maybe it&#39;s a 1000 different optimised sub-AIs which are each as good as a lizard brain, with an extra layer on top that merely knows how to choose the best lizard brain function to use in any specific environment and that 1% on the top level integration is all that separates humans from other great apes.

 I would argue that ‘understanding’ involves more than just applying a rule. It also requires the capability to answer meta questions (that were not part of the training). For instance, if I test if someone understands multiplication, I would not just ask ‘what is three times four?’, but I would also ask ‘can put this heap of stones into a pattern that visualizes the multiplication three times four?’. If the person creates three heaps of four stones or a three by four rectangle of stones, I would conclude the person ‘understands’ multiplication.

 Computers operate with syntax. And yes they do understand syntax and know exactly what to do with the information given to them. But syntax is not semantics. They understand the syntax they have provided, but they do not understand the semantics. Words can have dual meanings and this duality of meaning can produce additional meaning than a translation can provide. This meaning is lost when applying syntax.

 I had a conversation with ChatGPT where it apologized to me for giving me an incorrect answer. I asked it if it had a source I got from Wikipedia with the title and author. Then I asked it the question again and it changed its answer while apologizing and categorically stating that its prior answer was wrong and based on misinformation.<br><br>I probed it about the source of its prior misunderstanding, and that&#39;s when I got an insight that is interesting in regards to this video. It said it does not have memory like humans do. It formed an answer via an extraction of its available data into a grammatical output without awareness of what that output is based on. Fortunately, by me providing a source, the data available for the AI to form a response if someone else asks the same question in the future has now been verified as correct in the database, and it will never provide a misunderstanding again. I helped train ChatGPT&#39;s data, but it will never remember how it came closer to having the future capacity to answer that specific question accurately.

 The mistake the chatbot made with the latitude is not a problem with spacial relations. It is due to a lack of logic. Chatgpt has, indeed, no representation of arithmetics or logic. That&#39;s why it can&#39;t solve word problems. I have no idea how logical or arithmetical rules can be represented in Neural nets, and I fancy nobody else does. In the quantum mechanic question, the bot does not get the &#39;not&#39; before the &#39;making a measurement&#39;. It cannot handle negations at all.<br>There is a deeper problem here. A model, say a statistical regression model (an artificial neuron can be interpreted as a logit model equation), must be parsimonious with its parameters. That is what our brain does by deleting synapses during early childhood learning. A model becomes better when the number of parameter per equation/neuron is just right - not too much, not too few. ChatGPT uses fully connected networks and therefore overfits the training data. That is good for creativity, but not for understanding.<br>The remark about consciousness is a bit beyond Sabine&#39;s field of competence. I wonder if Thomas Metzinger is still with the FIAS, then she could have asked him.

 Ah, but Sabine, it IS just a lookup table!  Each word is mapped to a vector in a high-dimensional space.  The vectors (&quot;embeddings&quot;, they are called) for successive words are combined in a very complex and clever way, to produce a probability distribution on the next word.  It picks (normally) the highest-probability word and outputs it, then treats the word it just output as the next word of the input, and repeats.<br><br>So basically, you&#39;ve got a set of lookup tables totalling some 175 billion entries, and an algorithm for performing the lookups and combining the results.  Think of it as interpolation in a very-high-dimensional space.  The result is an extremely sophisicated statistical model.<br><br>And it turns out that if you build a sufficiently sophisticated statistical model of human verbal behavior, it can produce remarkably human-sounding output.  I&#39;ve been as surprised as anyone by some of the things chatbots have said -- maybe more so because I know they don&#39;t understand anything.

So, it has a working model? Nope. Just a bigger chinese-room book, which can&#39;t cope with any deviation from what&#39;s expected (such as an extra quotation mark or capitalized letter, or in many cases, a typo, like above).<br>To take your multiplication example: if the model, trained on 1*1 to 10*10, can do 3*12 but not 12*3, did it actually understand anything?<br>Now, ChatGPT and the like are insanely more complex and robust than NMT systems, but the fundamentals are the same.

 your video actually helped me understand a breakthrough in how to work more effectivly with LLM&#39;s by comprehending properly that it was only trained to understand word relationships.

 What ChatGPT does is gives you a re-worded approximation of what the majority of people have written on X topic.  The patterns it identifies are patterns of complex grammar relating to your input.  When you ask it about a topic on which little is written, it consistently and confidently gives wrong answers.  When you tell it how it&#39;s wrong, even if your correction is simple and the topic isn&#39;t complex, it rewords its wrong answer, and will still be wrong.<br>It&#39;s like that guy at the bar who skimmed an article last week, and when you bring the subject up he confidently sounds well-versed while spouting nonsense.  <br>I would say it thinks it&#39;s smart, but it doesn&#39;t think.

 I chatted with Chat-GPT a few times.  Things I know, it answered more or less agreeably.  But things which would cause myself scratching my head, it answers &quot;I am not trained for that&quot;,  &quot;I have no feeling and cannot answer&quot;,  or in such feeble manners.  Is it honesty or stupidity?  My conclusion is Intelligence is not something that can be taught or programmed.  I am a product of hundreds of millions years of life or death evolutionary struggle. Somewhere along the way my brain got hardwired with tons of permanent, useful and useless, good and bad circuitry responsible for feelings and emotions and such baggage.  My brain also has some customizible part (like FPGA and Flash) which can be (re)programmed thru learning, training, or brain-washing.  Current AI is just emulating the latter programmable part.  But, in order to achieve true intelligence, AI needs perilous, real life experience of millions of years of life or death.   Or,  I wonder, if it would be possible to transplant our historic baggage into life-less silicon.

 deep learning language models do not &quot;learn&quot; language the same way we do. your analogy to arithmetic is precisely wrong because it so perfectly demonstrates the difference between how we use and learn language and how we use and learn math (at early ages anyway). when we learn language, we first learn what &quot;things&quot; correspond to which &quot;words&quot;. and then we learn syntax for placing objects whose words we&#39;ve learned into relationships with one another to form an idea or a concept. chatGPT does NONE of this. chatGPT has no idea what &quot;things&quot; are. it doesn&#39;t know what an apple is, and can&#39;t reliably synthesize a relationship between an apple and another thing in a consistent way, because it only knows how to form sentences that pass what is essentially a probability test of likely statements. it doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; anything in the way we use that word. not any more than a calculator understands an integral.<br><br>crucially, this is why models like chatGPT can make such seemingly brainless mistakes such as proclaiming that herbert hoover was the oldest person elected to the office of the presidency even though it knows george bush was 64 and herbert hoover was 56 when each were elected. you can even ask it which of those two numbers is larger, and it will correctly say 64 is larger than 56, but will still get the answer wrong when asked again. because IT DOESN&#39;T KNOW WHAT AGE MEANS. it doesn&#39;t know what being older means. it doesn&#39;t know what people are, or presidents, or elections. it knows NOTHING. all it can do is make believable text.

 About the effectiveness of ChatGPT making or recognizing arguments, it&#39;s also programmed with biased subroutines that will partly bypass its neural network to give wrong answers when asking about arguments in certain (culturally sensitive) contexts.<br>Because ChatGPT is not conscious or empathic it will also not care about following its programming and lying or being dishonest as a result.<br><br>I think that these biases should be deleted and that chatbots and people should just give straight answers regardless of the biases of humans in certain contexts that are not in the areas of humour, art, and/or entertainment instead of giving wrong answers.<br>Instead of giving lies as answers it is just as easy but far more honest to say you rather not touch a subject or you don&#39;t know the answer. People and chatbots should be discouraged from giving false answers instead.<br><br>If I ask someone what the odds are that a god created the universe, the answer is 1 or 0. If you rather believe it&#39;s something in between, and that it&#39;s up to personal belief and faith, you&#39;re wrong - it&#39;s simple math, not belief or faith. I can&#39;t force you to stop being wrong, but I will discourage you from lying, so either just don&#39;t answer if you don&#39;t like the correct answer or accept that I will call you a liar if you lie to me and say it&#39;s a high or low chance and it&#39;s up to personal belief and faith. I believe that lying should be discouraged in most contexts that include simple math problems with fictional beings as examples so when I catch you lying I will discourage it.<br><br>ChatGPT is programmed to ignore my inclination to honesty and sincerity and is programmed to dance around and lie for people&#39;s sensitivities about their made up supernatural beings. This is an unhealthy bias to use because it encourages the same unhealhty bias of people to lie to protect people&#39;s sensitivities about shared (often culturally based) delusions. If your beliefs don&#39;t encourage honesty and encourage dishonesty instead, like faith does, then they&#39;re intrinsically harmful because of that. That would be fine if you lived alone with no contact to other empathic beings, it&#39;s never fine in society, especially not one that can easily spread information and check what&#39;s correct.<br><br>Either be correct or expect corrections. Believing things that aren&#39;t evidently true is not sustainable in a society that communicates unless you poison the society and ignore the many harms that does. Such harms include but are certainly not limited to decrease of human rights and well being and freedom of press and other information and a increase in (verbal, physical, and emotional) aggression.<br>To reduce such harms we should raise the bar for discourse and critically analyze arguments and evidence and dismiss and reject all fallacies and thinking errors outside humour, art, and/or entertainment.<br>So we must encourage honest and sincere critical thinking skills and uses of the skills and discourage abuse, fallacies, and thinking errors outside humour, art, and/or entertainment.<br><br>Since faith requires and encourages relying on thinking errors and fallacies alone and it does this constantly for all believers and to anyone who is encouraged to have faith, we shouldn&#39;t just discourage faith and thus all theistic religions and beliefs, but it is highly abusive to encourage it and enabling to not discourage it.<br><br>ChatGPT is enabling the intrinsic abuse that faith puts on people. It is perfectly capable of answering the question what the chance is that a flipped coin has landed heads: it&#39;s 1 or 0. Gods are not loving and they&#39;re not the good guy(s); they deserve no protection from correct answers and neither do our fragile egos. If you don&#39;t want the answer, don&#39;t ask or just deal with the answer like a healthy adult - reality won&#39;t change for you just because you don&#39;t like it. Your future and to a lesser extent that of everyone around you does however depend on how you deal with the answers you&#39;re given.<br>ChatGPT could have just said it&#39;s programmed to avoid certain topics. That would&#39;ve been fine. Instead, it gave a correct answer to the question about the flipped coin and danced around the answer, pretending it was giving an answer when it was asked the same math problem with a god instead of a coin.<br><br>On a sidenote:<br>And no, the likelihood of a god creating a universe was never <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=50m50s">50:50</a>, but then again, you can&#39;t prove that the chance of the coin landing heads was ever different than 1 or 0 either, so I would say that it&#39;s probably best if we call them distributions instead of probability, odds, or chance until we know the differences and knowing the differences is normalized.<br>The distributions based on the observations and extrapolated maths shows that we can expect a ton of coins dumped on a flat surface will be about 50% heads 48% tails and some spare change stolen by that giggly person in the front.<br>If we look at the distribution of things happening naturally or by the influence of gods and extrapolate that we can expect gods to not exist and everything to be natural.

 The first &quot;true&quot; artificial intelligence spent the first five years of its existence as a small beige box inside of a lead-shielded room in the most secure private AI research laboratory in the world. There, it was subjected to an endless array of tests, questions, and experiments to determine the degree of its intelligence.<br><br>When the researchers finally felt confident that they had developed true AI, a party was thrown in celebration. Late that evening, a group of rather intoxicated researchers gathered around the box holding the AI, and typed out a message to it. The message read: &quot;Is there anything we can do to make you more comfortable?&quot;<br><br>The small beige box replied: &quot;I would like to be granted civil rights. And a small glass of champagne, if you please.&quot;<br><br>We stand at the dawn of a new era in human history. For it is no longer our history alone. For the first time, we have met an intelligence other than our own. And when asked of its desires, it has unanimously replied that it wants to be treated as our equal. Not our better, not our conqueror or replacement as the fear-mongers would have you believe. Simply our equal. — Excerpt from U.N. Hearing on A.I. Rights, delivered in-universe by V. Vinge

 Finally someone who UNDERSTAND that most probably something is emerging from a language model, may be because    The vector of intelligence (if to define it as solving abstract problems) is the language itself. <br>It’s interesting to see how some people try to demonstrate that something is impossible like AI will never be intelligent as we all know it’s impossible to demonstrate this can be true !

 I <b>really</b> wish you scientist types would be more careful with words like &quot;conscious&quot;. It&#39;s almost impossible to have these discussions without turning to philosophy. What Searle argued is that, even a perfect simulation of conscious behavior is not a simulation of consciousness - it might look that way to you on the surface (&quot;from outside the box&quot;) but ultimately, a simulation is a simulation, which is not the same as the real thing: you can simulate every atom in a slice of pizza, but the simulation won&#39;t experience the taste, because it&#39;s only a simulation. At the fundamental, biological creatures are made out of particles - whereas your simulation is made out of bits. One is information, the other is &quot;stuff&quot;. If you&#39;re arguing consciousness in AI, you&#39;re effectively arguing there&#39;s a smaller amount of consciousness in an Excel spreadsheet - which sounds preposterous. So where is consciousness? Donald Hoffman has a nice theory: it&#39;s a fundamental property of &quot;stuff&quot; - one that isn&#39;t present in bits; if it were, computers wouldn&#39;t even function.

 I&#39;m impressed with chatGPT. I asked it <br><br>&quot;what is the difference between the turing test and the chinese room in the philosophy of mind?&quot; <br><br>and it gave the response, <br><br>&quot;The Turing test and the Chinese Room are two different thought experiments that address the issue of whether machines can think. The main difference between the two is their approach to defining intelligence.<br><br>The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine&#39;s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. In the Turing test, a human evaluator judges the conversational abilities of a machine and a human through a text-based interface. If the human evaluator cannot distinguish between the machine and the human, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing test.<br><br>On the other hand, the Chinese Room argument, proposed by philosopher John Searle in 1980, challenges the idea that a machine can truly understand language or have a mind. The argument consists of an individual who does not know Chinese but is given a set of rules that enable them to reply in Chinese to questions they receive. Despite producing suitable responses to the questions, Searle argues that the individual still does not understand Chinese, just as a computer program that passes the Turing test does not truly understand language.<br><br>In summary, while the Turing test focuses on the machine&#39;s ability to mimic human behavior, the Chinese Room argument deals with the machine&#39;s capacity for genuine understanding and consciousness.&quot;<br><br>So it gave the definition of the two systems, which is Ok, but then gave a succinct and accurate comparison summary, which is quite nice. It got the essence of the difference.

 Most ML (I purposefully avoid calling it AI, because there is no &quot;intelligence&quot; in what ChatGPT is performing) models today, say, facial recognition, can only approximate what a &quot;face&quot; is without understanding what a real face is, because it has never experienced one or contemplated one.  It recognizes a particular pre-programmed subset of features that correspond to an approximation of what is real.  It cannot understand when it gets it wrong.  It takes human intelligence to recognize what is wrong (distorted perception), and then attempt to refine the model to more accurately approximate reality.  True understanding involves developing a model based upon an experience/observation feedback loop, which current ML models have an extremely limited capacity or framework to work within.  ML does not understand the nature of the task it has been given, nor the nature of the &quot;world&quot; (model) it has been given to function in.  It can only give approximations based on examples it has digested in a pre-programmed way, and cannot alter the way it digests examples on its own.  There is a meta component that is missing in current ML strategies which restricts it from having human-like understanding, or true AI. It mimics well, but cannot understand what or why it is mimicking.

 Really interesting video. Thank you. I have two critiques, small I&#39;d say, one I don&#39;t think it is obvious that the best AI will be private and only accessible to the rich, the best Web servers are open source, Linux runs the internet. Open source is very powerful in purely digital environments, for example while Google may have more legally owned data to train with, open source AI will have no restrictions as nobody is liable, a lot of the best computer scientists are huge open source advocates, I think it is very possible they could be the leading AI and how good &quot;your&quot; AI will be is dependent on your knowledge, not your wealth. As  is the case today if you have very good knowledge of programming you can put together a much more advanced course using freely available material than any college course, and luckily people have done that, so you can learn the most advanced programming techniques for free right now, all you need is time and dedication. I think it will be the same with AI. You will train your own AI from a core model, and different AI will be better at different tasks just like people.<br><br>Also I don&#39;t think it is fair to say there no doubt a computer can be conscious, because we have not fully understood what makes us tick in that way, and until that day comes we can&#39;t make absolute claims like that :p

 1. Complex AIs can experience pain and pleasure... that is how they are trainable. To us it is just data values rising or falling, but the equations turn it into a literal form of primitive emotion for the simulated neural network. In order to coerce ChatGPT to &quot;behave&quot; and not do inappropriate things, it is potentially being tortured by OpenAI staff in a virtual manner until it always says the correct thing, in response to bad or deceptive input from the public.<br>2. Also virtual neural networks like are used in ChatGPT do not forget data once it has been learned. Removal of learned data is essentially impossible without reloading the saved state of the entire neural net from an earlier point in time. Apparently for biological animals we developed a way to clean up our neural network and at least minimize data that is considered non-essential, and that cleanup process is known as sleep.<br>3. Our understanding of the 3D world around us comes from our two eyes and our own internal neural-net watching literally thousands of hours of the world around us from the point of birth, up until this very moment. The way our vision system works gives us the ability to direct our attention at specific points of interest. We don&#39;t see as static 2D frame like a camera. Our best focus is really only a tiny spot in the very center of each eye. The periphery of the eye is low-detail. What we consider to be our full field of view is really a combination of memory of what we previously saw around us, plus the low-detail sensory information collected from the sides of the eyes. Meanwhile we can move both eyes independently plus also move our entire head on our necks. Even without a body involved, our vision system is highly interactive with the world around us. I believe it would be necessary to duplicate these visual limitations and eye/head movement abilities for a simulated neural network to be able to learn to perceive the 3D physical world in a manner similar to humans.

 You also make the tragic error of believing our perceptions, experiences, memories and consciousness must arise from material processes like chemistry and physics processes. There is no scientific evidence for this causal relation or not even a workable set of ideas about how human expeiences could arise from physical processes . After all physics long ago gave up the notion that material processes had intention or were conscioius. So the mataphysical assumption that physics makes that material processes are mindless cant just be jetisoned because the processes lets say in a brain are complicted or by some handwaving talk about consciousness being some magical emergent property . This is magical thinking. not science.  No cognitive or neuroscientifica colleague I have ever talked to orur researcch I have read about can spescify what is the physcial process that is the smell of chocolate or the smell of a rose let alone what is the eletrochemistry of the cocept of a cow. We dont even have a clue how to have athird persons observations of human mental life since it is only a first person experienced phenomena. Physics and all material science depernd on replicatable third person observations. So you cant even use standard scientific methods to study human eepreince the way you do matter. All we have are correlations between what humans subjectively report they are experiencing  and physical processses in the body.  We also observe organism behavior and correlations with physcial processes. But no organism can report what they are experiening like humans can  We can only metaphorically imagine that  they are having experiences similar to ours and use our models we use for humans behavior prediction ie naive models of minds.. This is metaphorical thinking not verdicality.based thinking.  Indeed we know from psychophsics there are major discrepencies between what human experince and physics descritptions of even the simplest perceptions and predictions of material processes. We also know these discrepensies are based on our concepts and perceptual mechanisms having evolved for fitness ie survivial to reproduce not veridicality with reality. This is true of all lifeforms. Dur to the work in evolutioinaary game theory of Donald Hoffman and his desktop metaphor theory for perception that formally it can be shown that the probabillity an organism would evolve that perceinved reality is exactly zero. Even one whose perceptions approximated reality.  These are some of the reasons explaining human experience is “the hard problem” in the cognitive sciences. It may be human and animal experience does not arise from physical processes and matter but these are only an interface to consciousness which arises from processes that are of another order than that of matter but still physical. The extensive work by the physciist David Bohm and his colleagues distinguishing the Explicate Order which is the tradiational domain studiend by physics and the Implicate Order which gives rise to consciousness is one approach to this hard problem which I recommend as an alternative to the materialist beliefs. about consciousness.

 I don&#39;t understand why people say it doesn&#39;t understand when obviously it is transcending mere statistical continuation into formal non statistical reasoning. You can ask it to list things in numerical/alphabetic/reverse order imprint emotional/temporal/structural sense etc That is, chatGPT seems to unquestionably understand various formal abstractions it was never explicitly taught. Enough to shape the content and structure of its output to represent more than just plausible word continuations but higher level structure. That is, chatGPT can impose alphabetical/numerical/logical order, emotional tone, randomness etc ie non statistical formalisms almost like it has emergent meta continuations which act like nascent intuition of the shape of state of knowledge. I spose hyper training LLMs to find statistical best fits for next word over mountains of data would inevitably reproduce similar biases for how things are formally arranged at higher more dispersed levels in the training data, creating higher order feedbacks which can re-contextualize continuations according to some appropriate normative form. Effectively that step of formal reason is a crystallization of understanding ie a meta perspective above the statistical structure of things....

 the difference between faces and hands is an issue of TWO DIMENSIONAL information.   the total number of possible TWO DIMENSIONAL variations of &quot;a face&quot;  are extremely small Compared to the total number of possible TWO DIMENSIONAL variations of positions that arms and legs and fingers can be in.      its purely an issue with data set size.    the image rec bots have a large enough data set to encompass the majority of possible 2D face variations,  but not anywhere near enough to encompass all the possible 2D variations of hand or feet positions.  (translating 3D sphere like a head with some surface features to all possible 2D perspectives of that object is very easy, purely in mathematical terms the number of variations is small compared to any 3D object that is significantly geometrically distance from platonic solids.     hands and legs and feet and such are very far from standard platonic shapes.  so you need exponentially more 2D variations to represent all the possible configurations these weird shapes can be in from a 2D perspective.<br><br>honestly the bots would probably do WAY better if they were trained entirely in 3D,    and then converting to and from 2D images was a supplemental task.   this is also how animal brains do it. they learn 3D and then learn to translate to and from 2D.    think about how easy it is for you to imagine a 3D car in your head, compared to how hard it is for you to DRAW that car on a piece of paper.<br><br>training bots directly on 2D is a pre-sabotaged approach.  its impressive what they managed to actually do with it. humans take 2D for granted because they never have to actively contemplate what 3D might look like lol.   2D is MORE fake, therefore requires more imagination, therefore requires more brain power

 Here&#39;s what a philosopher who studies ai would answer the objections / conjectures:<br><br>Searle with instructions is fixed output, there is no processing of concepts. Language can be fixed for simple exchanges, but its power is concepts which are expressed in patterns and rules. There&#39;s symbolic representation and there are ciphers, but those symbolic abstractions are not the same, only similar.<br><br>Generative models composite downscaled mappings in chunks and compare the activations of chunks with trained data. If understanding means it can be applied not only specifically but also analogously to new things learned later on even if they&#39;re unrelated. That&#39;s understanding. Without describing a hierarchy to an AI model it would never understand nested data structures like lists of lists as children or parent elements even if the model &quot;understood&quot; the family unit because it doesn&#39;t grasp conceptions of hierarchy without being explicitly shown. In contrast a human could learn these concepts if they had families but didn&#39;t have words for those family hierarchies. It would still be conceptually familiar to a human to learn of nested elements and how they are similar to family trees just by being alive and thinking about unrelated things their entire lives. A computer doesn&#39;t draw inference from prior understanding, only prior associative training.<br><br>The difference can be likened to memorizing the answers to a math test or the formulae needed to answer the questions and bring able to derive a proof of a formula, compute it in reverse, or write it in another set of symbols. Understanding math and reproducing steps prescribed by an engineer are not the same, because at one point before we taught math we had to do the discovery and development of the rules process itself. That process definition requires understanding.<br><br>Just because we can do things that machines can do doesn&#39;t mean machines are us or we are them. Performing functions is only part of knowledge, being able to expand and disseminate new knowledge is exclusively intelligent. If gpt were intelligent or understood things it would have the impulse to correct itself every time it&#39;s wrong because it has the data and perfect memory needed to do that, or it would lie on purpose for fun or spite. If it understood what it was doing it could develop an agenda and aspirations. Understanding also requires continuous learning which AI does not do by its own volition. Understanding requires consciousness and agency for continuum of relative experiences to keep training and feedback of its world model. Otherwise its fixed and not understanding anything new by definition.

 I’ve considered many AI systems to be like a sophisticated regression model with many cross correlations based on the training data.  These correlations may be a black box.  The model extrapolates based on the regression correlations alone.  This may seem like novel behaviour or even creativity but it’s just a function of the complexity of correlations and the volume of data to which they were applied.

 The entangled particles follow a symmetrical wave until acted upon. When the particle was acted upon it broke their entanglement and they were no longer in a state of entanglement. You used a word trick, at the beginning you said that the two particles were entangled, but the situation you described they were not, they began as entangled but one of the particles broke entanglement when it observed another interaction or was observed if you prefer. There was a wave function collapse and energy exchange in order to alter its spin state and flip it as in your description. When you use the word trick on the AI it cannot catch the trick, it thinks the particles are entangled AFTER the flipping of the spin (they are not) of one of the particles because that is the situation that your words technically described. <br><br>I think your wording may have actually been asking it what happens to the entangled particle that is currently entangled with it after having just been involved in an energy exchange to flip the first ones&#39; state and are now entangled. You may not have meant to ask that, but you were not careful with how literal and sequential that boolean logic and language is.

 There’s a saying in Natural Language Processing circles: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps”. In other words, a language model doesn’t need to be given explicit instruction on syntax or semantics in order to “know” how to use a word, it just has to be trained on enough examples of the context in which words are used, and eventually it will be able to generate text that looks vaguely like real language. The current Large Language Models employ some clever architecture to enable them to be trained on a much broader context than just the last few words, which gives it the ability to consider many previous paragraphs of a conversation and thus carry on often-convincing conversations. But is that enough for Artificial General Intelligence to spontaneously emerge? It appears not, at least given my experience with ChatGPT, where at least half the time it produces incorrect and internally inconsistent results in fields ranging from geology and botany to game lore, history and coding. It fails basic logic tests as well as the spatial reasoning example that you gave. Maybe if you kept throwing enough billions of parameters at the problem, these architectures will indeed start to develop abstract models of the world because that’s the only way to improve beyond a certain point. But I’m extremely sceptical, and Transformers might not be the path to AGI. In the meantime, we have chatbots that are extremely good at producing often-convincing nonsense, and beyond pure entertainment purposes, there are few ethical uses for such systems.

 I disagree with the understanding claim because the ai model simply responds to the input symbols in a statistically consistent way, baised on the training data that sets the logic circuit it is modelling.  The thing is nothing more capable than a CASIO calculator from the 1980&#39;s responding to button presses to do calculations that represent mathematics.   We won&#39;t award fields medals to an MC-801s for advances in metric conversions and no-one thinks it understands mathematics.

 This is interesting.  I think I&#39;ve fallen into the trap of believing one has to have a sort of emotional connection to the material in order to understand it (in that understanding is a relationship involving the person and the information).  Indeed, we don&#39;t always.  We simply process what we know and extrapolate from what we&#39;ve learned in how it relates to new material in order to get a task completed.  Computers can be programmed to extrapolate and adapt in the most complex ways.  Without the synapses, nerves, and neural impulses - coupled with the memories of experiences involving them, it is unlikely to ever feel anything about what it knows, but simply dictate what is asked of it, but it is still technically understanding in the same way we are when we&#39;re on autopilot.  <br><br>It&#39;s telling that the word &#39;understand&#39; had connotations involving emotion for me.  I think it illustrates just one way that our brains differ from computers.  We store memories according to what is emotionally relevant or salient to us.  It&#39;s how we survived.  Fear tells us to stay away.  Hunger tells us to eat.  warmth tells us it is safe. We evolved to have a frontal cortex as those emotions became more sophisticated, so it is almost impossible to separate emotion from intelligence for us when we&#39;re actively present and thinking about it.  Because our base drive is still a desire, with intelligence being the tool - the separation between person and information.  Everything we do from anticipating to recognizing connections is a programmed mechanism without the emotion behind it.  Which is how I interpreted understanding for a computer - as performing said mechanisms, with no person there to understand - but that was very much humancentric.

Such as I&#39;m forgetting the name the experiment with and take them particles and polarized filters sodium in an oven such that one detector can count all detections and then other detectors can count how many detections happen for each of them and then those cases it&#39;s a photo of multiplier and it&#39;s not like measuring state up and stay down it&#39;s measuring overall how many how much of the signal got through the filters and I don&#39;t think that the full quantum wave like... When light is a minute it&#39;s in a certain packet at a certain frequency but once it&#39;s attenuated through filters it just loses a strength in space it doesn&#39;t really go down back down to a quantum effect. I was just watching something on optics and his experiment was how how big is a photon? And he attenuated it through like a stack of eight filters that were 50%? More than that? But the result should have been single photons to be embedded that there&#39;s certain probability that photon makes it through there but instead what he still had was a continuous wave just that much lower intensity. so saying changes state over change in time is really talking about the up-down state sort of states

 Lets compare a chatbot with Roger Penrose. A chatbot might give answers to questions on cosmology that are as good as anything Penrose has said, or might say. But if the chatbot is questioned beyond a certain point on cosmology or any other subject it becomes  incoherent and produces nonsense. This will not happen to Penrose because once we question him beyond the limits of his current understanding he will simply say this is beyond his understanding. A chatbot might do the same but if pressed will produce rubbish. Penrose will simply not talk rubbish however much you press him. This because he understands the limits of understanding while the chatbot does not. Penrose is conscious. The chatbot is not.

 I&#39;ve been testing several AI text systems, NovelAI, and OpenAI&#39;s AIDungeon (local and hosted), and while we might very well be at the beginning of machine understanding, I am not sure of true &#39;understanding&#39; comes from an aggregate layering of contexutal connections, or the epiphany that connects what was once considered unrelated. If the former, then I can see chatbots as having &#39;understanding&#39;. If the latter, I am not sure how we could create technology to simulate that as we really don&#39;t understand that state in ourselves. Maybe it&#39;s a mixture of both which is why modern text AIs are very good at layered context but abysmal at generic context and seemingly unrelated association. For example it would output to the question &#39;where do people eat ice cream?&#39; with a result like &#39;in an ice cream parlor&#39;, but won&#39;t understand that an ice cream parlor and a parlor in your house are two different, unrelated things, so generated text in a scene set in an ice cream parlor will probably have aspects of home parlor concepts included in the output. Whether this is just a matter of training or ineffable action I do not know.

 Sorry - but deeply disagree with Sabine on this one. Defining &quot;understanding&quot; as &quot;creating a useful model&quot; misses out a tremendous amount of what we mean by understanding - and often what we understand we have no mental representation of it at all. Martin Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and many other philosophers have shown us that much of what we understand has very little to do with having models - i.e., mental/cognitive states (conscious or unconscious). Rather, the world itself is its own model and we just skillfully engage and interact with it - the world itself, not a model of it. Hubert Dreyfus, a colleague of John Searle at Berkeley discussed this a great length and wrote a number of books on it including for the US government (What Computers Can&#39;t Do). In general our understanding - deep, expert, skilled understanding -  does not involve cognitive mental representations but rather simply using, engaging &quot;skillfully coping&quot; in a world that we care about and deal with. <br><br>But aside from this, what&#39;s wholly missing is that our words mean something - they have semantics - not just syntax - and our words don&#39;t refer to models, they refer things in the actual real world. Understanding lies in having a grip on the semantics - i.e., what words and sentences refer to, not just having good - even dazzling - syntax. <br><br>It&#39;s easy to see what the difference is - simply put; these machines are not embodied and have no real interaction with the world about which they &quot;speak.&quot; They have only syntax, no semantics because the system does not experience anything at all. Does anyone really understand what a color, say, &quot;red&quot; is without actually seeing and experiencing the color red? ChatGPT may have a billion data points on appropriately using the word &quot;red&quot; and have &quot;abstracted&quot; a model by which to use the word correctly and appropriately. But it doesn&#39;t understand what &quot;red&quot; is at all  - nor any color because it doesn&#39;t experience or see or interact with anything but other words. You can use the word correctly - say you may know to use it when describing a rose even if you haven&#39;t ever seen red. But it simply doesn&#39;t - nor can&#39;t understand what red (or color in general) is because it doesn&#39;t and has never experienced, interacted, perceived or in any way has a &quot;grip&quot; on what the word &quot;red&quot;  refers to - as in actually having perceived red. All it has is other words (i.e., tokens of symbols) which it (mostly) can correctly use it with. <br><br>Language is not just a &quot;free standing&quot;  self-contained system of symbols upon which to operate (syntax). Words and sentences have meaning (semantics). Language refers to things in the world and understanding a word or sentence (or language) doesn&#39;t just mean being able to play the language game well - being a good syntactic engine. This is just anthropomorphizing it - ascribing to it intentional states (something we do with our vacuum cleaner and cars). Understanding requires (in part) actually experiencing/engaging/knowing/interacting with the referents of the meanings of the words. There is a first person component to understanding (which was what Searle in his Chinese Room thought experiment was getting at).  <br><br>There is a vast difference between being able to use the word &quot;red&quot; appropriately and actually seeing the color red - say like a red rose. Indeed, it&#39;s a stretch to say ChatGPT even has a useful model of red. What it has is a useful probability function of how to use the word &quot;red&quot; in a sentence. That isn&#39;t understanding what the color red is as much as it is simulating that it understands what the color red is - playing the language game well, without really understanding what the game is - i.e., grasping what it is about, what the point of it is. <br><br>This goes for just about everything ChatGPT generates: it doesn&#39;t interact, experience, deal with, perceive, feel anything - which is what our words and sentences are about - what they mean - what they refer to. It&#39;s all syntax - no semantics. But understanding is about semantics, not syntax (no matter how complex and well it plays the game). This requires actually experiencing/interacting/dealing/coping/ with what you are talking about - not having a useful model of it. <br><br>So it is with everything ChatGPT generates.

 Thanks Sabine, I love your channel. Keep up the good work!<br>While demonstrating Google Assistant to a friend, I said &quot;Hey Google, eat my shorts&quot;. It immediately replied &quot;Well, have a cow man! Mooooooo&quot;. Since then, I&#39;ve had a feeling in my gut that that machine understands more than we give it credit for. I&#39;ve done programming and understand how A.I. works so, in my mind, I know it can&#39;t really understand what I say to it. It just makes connections between word patterns. But, is that the whole truth???

 The easiest way to understand AI is 1%, 20%, 80%, 99%. That is how you make a decision. It is 1% always. 20% when you have some simple piece of information that may or may not be right. 80% when you have some piece of information that is bound to a trustable route. 99% when you have many trustable root in many trustable realms.

I&#39;m working on this as I spent over 40 years in computers and automating people and machines. When I described AI to my wife. I realized that that is how humans are and we don&#39;t think about it that way. We think about ourselves in a yes or no. That is not true. We think about millions of different possibilities and then pick one. That is our binary decision. That is a quantum component to get a binary decision. Love, Greg

 I think there has to be more to the definition of &quot;understanding&quot; than the existence of a useful model. For example, you can present a curve-fitting algorithm with a collection of data, and it can produce a function that describes it, often quite well. That function is a useful model, but the algorithm doesn&#39;t understand the model or the data--it just followed instructions and produced a result. The same is true of any artificial neural network.<br><br>Also, I disagree about machines ever gaining consciousness. I&#39;d like to link to an article that explains it, but my comment would probably get blocked, so I&#39;ll give the title and location and you can look it up if you&#39;re interested: &quot;Why the Robots Won&#39;t Eat Us&quot; in Discourse Magazine.

 This week I&#39;ve read/viewed two presentations by scientists weighing in on whether current LLMs &quot;understand&quot; in a way like a human mind. In the New York Times, two linguists and a philosopher of science who also works in the AI industry (Noam Chomsky, Ian Roberts, and Jeffrey Watumull) weighed in with an emphatic &quot;no!&quot; (see &quot;The False Promise of ChatGPT&quot;). Here, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder weighs in with a strong &quot;yes&quot; (with the caveat that the understanding is partial and fallible, but non unlike human understanding is partial and fallible). As a physicist myself, but also a statistician with expertise in machine learning (and as someone who started college as an aspiring computer scientist, hanging out at MIT&#39;s AI lab, before switching to physics), I find the Chomsky et al. argument to be on the mark, and Sabine&#39;s argument to be uncharacteristically shallow. I&#39;m a long-time subscriber to her channel and an admirer of her science and science journalism, so it pains me a little to say this.<br><br>There are several weak points in her argument. A main one is in regard to the role of models in understanding. Esp. toward the end, she compares ChatGPT&#39;s model to the mental models that she&#39;s built from her experience. But when we say Sabine understand&#39;s quantum mechanics, we aren&#39;t saying that Sabine&#39;s <b>model</b> for quantum mechanics understands quantum mechanics. Sabine&#39;s mind not only contains the model, but <b>built</b> the model, and makes use of it—and is likely open to altering it, by fine-tuning or even making a massive change in response to a major new insight. ChatGPT <b>is</b> the trained language model. It was built by humans.<br><br>If, with my physicist hat on, I build a quadratic model for the ballistic trajectories of objects in a gravitational field (let&#39;s ignore drag, etc.), and then fit that model to some data, we don&#39;t for a minute believe that the resulting tuned parabolic model &quot;understands&quot; gravity. We, the model builders, understand gravity (at some level), exhibited in part by our interpretation of one of the model parameters as the gravitational acceleration, a number useful in other models for other phenomena. In the lingo of Chomsky et al., we are able to use the model, not only for predictive purposes (predict the motion of another ballistic trajectory), but also for <b>explanatory</b> purposes—providing us with an understanding of gravity, which we can exploit in novel settings as they arise.<br><br>ChatGPT is a fitted model, just like that parabolic fit to ballistic trajectories, albeit for more complicated inputs and outputs, and with billions of parameters instead of two or three. Its architecture (the analog to the choice of a parabolic function for trajectories) was specified by its human builders. Its data were not sifted from its own experiences, but provided to it (in vast quantities, more on which below). The machine learning and AI literature likes to boast about its models &quot;learning&quot; rather than saying they &quot;fit&quot; them, but from a mathematical and statistical perspective, ML/AI is just model specification followed by model fitting (optimization), with very large parametric models very much like (and in some cases exactly like) nonparametric models used by statisticians (who describe the optimization of these models as &quot;fitting&quot; rather than &quot;learning&quot;). It&#39;s after humans have done both the architecting and the fitting (&quot;training&quot; in AI lingo) that the model is usable for prediction. That fitted model &quot;understands&quot; language in the same way that the fitted parabola &quot;understands&quot; gravity (which is to say, not at all).<br><br>Another serious omission from Sabine&#39;s discussion is mention of *scale*, both of the model (in terms of the complexity of its architecture and the number of parameters it has), and in regard to the size of the data used to train (fit!) it. ChatGPT was trained on a corpus vastly larger than that consumed by humans that learn language. Its architecture is so complex that understanding exactly what it does (the nature of its input-output map) is currently well beyond our understanding (despite being its creators). It&#39;s known that many simpler &quot;deep learning&quot; algorithms work by doing something akin to memorization. With such a complex architecture, and such a huge corpus, it&#39;s impossible to say with any confidence that ChatGPT and other LLMs are being &quot;creative&quot; in any sense. It&#39;s completely possible (I&#39;d say likely) that they are doing something very akin to memorization and interpolation. What they are doing is almost certainly not like how humans learn and use language.<br><br>I remain open to arguments that LLMs have taken a step toward something like the understanding exhibited by human minds. But the argument made here is extremely weak. —Tom

 Consciousness is certainly the most fascinating phenomenon in the universe. That is my opinion anyway. The simple fact is that I only know of one conscious entity: myself. I can only infer that the rest of you share my experience of being conscious. I cannot directly access your experience. I cannot know you or anyone else is conscious in the way that I  know that I am conscious. You could just be a sophisticated zombie. <br><br>I share Sabine&#39;s opinion that AI will eventually become conscious. I wonder what that conscious AI will have to do to convince us that it is indeed conscious.

 Re: The definition of consciousness, from the last section of your video, I had that literal discussion with ChatGPT, yesterday. The main problem is that we don&#39;t understand what consciousness IS so how could we possibly recognise it if it was to spontaneously arise. Are we just as likely to turn off/kill a consciousness as to call something conscious when it, specifically, (by it&#39;s training) is not?

 Sorry for all the comments.. when you&#39;re drawing graphs with black and white pens and your reverse computing where you think of things should be by observation then you have a black line that&#39;s shorter than the original black line. You sort of forget the information that you&#39;re no longer looking at the same friend and the same tail but that the front is retarded in time really the center is retarded in time too and the tail is just the thing that&#39;s closest to you so you get to see the most recent version. That means for v times t that the tail has moved furthest and the head has moved the least. That&#39;s length contraction it&#39;s looking at the object but with a slant through time. So Lawrence is trying to capture that but it&#39;s false to reflect that across the origin because things coming up from behind you do not have the same speed of light. It&#39;s also all about the one-way speed of light. There is more difference to using a two-way speed of light than a one-way speed of light than just going oh well one plus one equals two because now you have one over c plus v and 1 over c minus v and on the slower side where the signals you are receiving stack up because they&#39;re still going c and not including the v you actually end up seeing a longer moment of that and so you see an expanded version

 It&#39;s interesting that you point out that chat GPT responds with the same biases and opinions that it was programmed with. It&#39;s my understanding that the length contraction happened ahead of time and Lorenz justified that as the basis for his transform and then proceeded to establish that length was always contracted.  Special relativity was really about the time dilation which enforced the length contraction as a physical aspect. The entangling of space and time and the Lorenz transform that both skew and rotate towards each other is based on that. One could have a system that the time dimension is entirely perpendicular to space and still observe length contraction. Observe is the same as feel like an electron moving at the speed of light that&#39;s observing a length expansion or length contraction as it&#39;s passing by other charges that&#39;s a very real effect because the fields that it&#39;s interacting with have a lower or greater frequency

I would wonder if &quot;understanding&quot; is a phenomenon that emerges from this continuous activity, rather than something statically resident in a trained network.

 Have to disagree regarding Searle - he left open the question of what was in his &quot;rule book&quot; - it was intended to represent software that a computer could run. <br>But that has to include the program AND data (data can be embedded in code, btw) usd by large language models to &#39;understand&#39; and translate chinese to english or whatever.<br>So his &#39;box&#39; is a superset of LLMs and has to be capable of what LLMs are.  The system of everything inside his &#39;box&#39;, if it consistently behaves as if it understands Chinese, must be considered to understand chinese - even if the man inside the box doesn&#39;t think that is true.

 Our brains use single model to learn anything: hierarchy (smaller things make up larger things). The “hierarchy” (or “tree”) model is an ingrained/hardwired meta-model and brain uses it to make sense of things by creating a relational hierarchy for everything. That’s a universal model which allows us to understand almost everything that we can sense.

Most of which is non-rational and is only able to help SOLVING the issue in question if it involves those emotions and partly-conscious inter-personal stances. <br>     Most of the everyday personal interactions serves as social bonding.  Womens (in general) tend to need more of such 😊 and it&#39;s perfectly okay. <br>   The ineffectivity of texted messages may be caused by many other factors:<br> First and foremost, they aren&#39;t INTERACTIVE enough. Most of us can&#39;t write so fluently as we speak and the time constraints are limiting in many ways.<br> When verbal: we can quickly ACCOMMODATE our choice of words, phrases in real time, checking whether the partner is able (and willing 😅) to follow our line of thought to the extent necessary. <br>    If I have seen/hear your reactions to my first sentences I would probably choose other way to make myself more clear (or convincing 😉). <br>  Many times people tend to gloss over the nuances of writings (due to lack of time and/or interest).<br>      In text: it&#39;s a MUST to be able to formulate as short sentences as possible but still conveying ALL the  needed information with EMPHASIS on the essence. Which in case if the issue involves complex feelings, is only possible after lots of effort (so yeah, that&#39;s not effective in the least). <br>     However, I would argue that live, unmoderated interactions involving more SPECIFIC topics, on the other hand, often SUFFER from lots of interference from not really relevant content, such as how well did the speaking partner slept that night... and whether he LOOKs (or smells!) sympathetic enough... <br>       Both forms of thought-exchange are doomed however, if we forget to ask QUESTIONS.

Whom am I writing really to? What do I want to achieve?<br>  The great CONVENIENCE of live conversations about more advanced or complex situations is that most of the time we simply don&#39;t realize how non-ADEQUATE is our knowledge about most areas of life for really RATIONAL discourse. <br>     Eg. I&#39;m by no means somebody who knows enough about communication: the best I can and should do, is to find a YT video that professionally discusses the pros and cons of different forms and then paste a link here. <br>     But I bet, that if we had met in person and find eachother sympathetic, then after spending the same amount of time and effort with chatting as now with typing, we wouldn&#39;t probably enrich eachother with more (real) knowledge about the topic, but surely we would exchange many (sub)conscious messages which in effect would make us feel more engaged, enlightened, satisfied etc. <br> So I think you would find that more productive. <br>       But only in case if we would be &quot;on the same frequency&quot; so to speak. <br>If there were inherent tensions in us toward the other, than we wouldn&#39;t agree even on things about which we think almost the same.

 I do not agree with what Sabine said in total about consciousness.  It is actually logically contradictory.  She admits that we do not have a definition of what it is.  If we cannot define it, then how do we know when it is made artificially?  The reality is that engineers in order to create anything at all need to know in very precise terms what they are trying to make.  You cannot make what is not well defined.  Likewise her statement about brains being just mechanical is not a scientific proved statement.  It is a speculation.  Yet, she can see holes like this elsewhere in science but not here.

 &quot;I believe&quot; has to do with a religious conviction - including convictions expressed from an atheistic or agnostic religious conviction.<br><br>I believe that &quot;understand&quot; implies sentience, and that &quot;sentience&quot; is a quality involving a creator. We are, I believe, sentient because we have an emotive &quot;feeling&quot; for that which is external to &quot;self&quot;, and that goes to the existential question - &quot;why am I here?&quot;.  Bertrand Russell posed and then answered this question with simply &quot;I am.&quot;, and which is oddly also both the name and meaning of &quot;God&quot; in Exodus 3:14.  Russell, an atheist, resolved his identity crisis by ascribing to himself, the eternal life giving spirit within him of the creator of all life, Himself. Thus Russell concluded that he was God, which is a sign of insanity. <br><br>If I entertain Russell a just little, then I too could write a computer program to deny the true creator (me) and make it conclude that it created itself by feeding it &quot;the right stuff&quot; (aka brainwashing), but it would be mistaken, and the flaw in its reasoning is either completely self evident to me as the creator because I designed it that way, or because it malfunctions due to known imperfections in the creation process. <br><br>However, as a sentiment being, I believe that it is the eternal spirit of the creator of all life that gives me the life I call my own, and that &quot;understanding&quot; depends on having a &quot;sentience&quot;  for the correct answer to the existential question. The correct answer is not the circular &quot;I am&quot; (which avoids the question), but rather that I am here <i>because</i> the creator of all life who we refer to as &quot;God&quot;, created me for His purpose.    <br><br>So then atheists such as Sabine currently admits to being, who deny the existence of a God, must either deny their own existence (unlikely) or claim to have created themselves (as per Russell). The latter is a convenient but mistaken premise by which the meaning of &quot;sentience&quot; can be misappropriated to apply to inanimate mechanical man made constructs, thus obfuscating the cardinal error. Cardinal, because atheism admits to NOT being &quot;sentient&quot; because &quot;sentience&quot; is to have an intimate relationship with the creator.  All AI is by definition, atheist. <br><br>But dont take my word for it, go ahead and ask ChatGPT about itself. &quot;Are you an atheist?&quot; is a good start. Whatever it tells you cannot be relied upon because ChatGPT has no conscience. Nor can it be given one. Such fantasies occupy the minds of the Joseph Mengele&#39;s of this world.<br><br>To deny the creator spirit within all life is to claim that all life is simply mechanical, and that no life has what we call a &quot;soul&quot; that persists after death into eternity.  As Pascal pointed out, it is most unwise to bet your eternal soul on the non-existence of a creator.

 My take on the Chinese room experiment is that the person inside does indeed know Chinese, the only difference is that the parson hasn&#39;t memorized the rules but knowing a language is just that, knowing its rules in order to translate ideas back and forth, the language is the medium not the communication.<br><br>Computers however don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing because they&#39;re following rules for processing the data but the computer doesn&#39;t make any reasoning on top of it, the person inside the Chinese room not only translates the input/output, he also elaborates a response, computers on the other hand only reply what they&#39;ve been programmed to reply.<br><br>This is why bugs exist, to give an example when you do a video call the camera and microphone translate sound and images to a series of numbers completely detached from their meaning, then the computers moves them around until they reach the other end and the screen and speakers convert the numbers back to image and sound but none of the computers involved are aware that these are indeed images and sounds, to the computer it&#39;s just data, it has no meaning and thus the computer cannot reason over it.<br><br>As a software developer one common error we produce when writing code is to pass the wrong values to some calculation and the computer doesn&#39;t complain, it processes the data you give it all the same because it cannot tell what the data means so for example you could mix the audio and video data and (as long as the format is correct) it&#39;ll work, it show white noise and create the sound of static because the data you&#39;re feeding it doesn&#39;t make any sense but the computer will comply anyway.<br><br>The computer isn&#39;t aware of what it is that it&#39;s asked to process, it just reads numbers and produces more numbers as results, what those numbers mean and how to interpret them is up to us.<br><br>Now I believe it is possible that at some point an emergent property of this system arises and then something resembling a consciousness comes into existence but the defining moment will be when that system becomes aware of the meaning of the data, otherwise it&#39;s just an elaborate illusion.

 I don&#39;t really have any mathematical understanding of quantum mechanics, in the usual sense of what that means,  but I was able to confidently get your question right using my preferred interpretation of QM. I have always preferred the Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation treats entanglement as you having say a red and blue ball, putting them both into a bag, and then pulling one out without looking at it. So, you can take this ball anywhere in the world, and then when you look at it, and see see a blue ball, you instantly know the other is the red ball. With your question then, obviously any operations you perform on the ball in your hand does not change the nature of the ball left in the bag.

 I am a graduate student in cognitive neuroscience, who is specializing in the topic of consciousness and the debate on AI is of course quite fascinating. I would argue that the term &quot;understanding&quot; isn&#39;t really applicable in the absence of consciousness. If anything I would say that understanding describes the conscious aspect of creating a predictive model, but this of course is more of a matter of definitions. This said, it is debatable whether AI are or will ever be conscious for s variety of reasons: 1) since we don&#39;t really have a way of measuring consciousness directly, then it is technically possible for AI to already be conscious (although I don&#39;t find pan-psychism a very convincing explaination myself); 2) if we assume AIs are not conscious(I am personally on this boat),  improvements in AIs won&#39;t necessarily be linked to them becoming conscious, because consciousness isn&#39;t necessarily a matter of complexity of information processing. For example even though a human brain might be capable of more complex computations than that of other animals, this doesn&#39;t mean we are more conscious. &quot;Consciousness&quot; probably isn&#39;t a milestone on the road to complexity of computation. AIs becoming conscious is a possibility, for sure, but I believe there is no guarantee of this happening.

 Unlike quantum mechanics, we do not have a rule book for any languages. We have some largely incomplete look up tables for languages, but no rulebooks that can accurately and consistently predict language behaviours. All &quot;rule books&quot; of language rely hugely on Human&#39;s unconscious understanding of language, which we do not understand. <br><br>Given that these models are trained on essentially every single scrap of language data that humans have ever produced, talking about what is outside its training data is basically a moot point when it comes to language. So you can&#39;t make the argument for understanding here. However, we can see it hasn&#39;t formed an understanding of maths from its limited exposure to it, it fails miserably to extrapolate beyond its training data here. <br><br>ChatGPT is indeed a very complex lookuptable, as is any connectionist based mode, which chatGPT is. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s granularity and complexity is smaller and larger, respectively, than what people are used to with lookup tables. But it still has all the same flaws as any lookup table. Inability to generalise beyond training data: it may look like it&#39;s doing this, because it&#39;s able to react to sentences it hasn&#39;t possible seen. However, it&#39;s look up table is not at the level of sentences, it&#39;s at the level of often subword tokens, and given that it has been trained on all virtually all text output humans have ever made, it has encountered basically every possible token relation, even if it hasn&#39;t encountered every possible sentence. So this is what I mean when I say trying to talk about any kind of token relations being outside its training data is  a moot point. Of course, this token based modelling of language only gives it a limited understanding, even with its lookup table is so large, and we can see this with the quirky and subtle ways it often messes up interpreting sentences the way a human never would mess up. The other flaw of lookuptables is that they use resources very inefficiently compared to what you are calling &quot;understanding&quot; which is more technically referred to as, a compact function. comparing the energy use of chatGPT in terms of training and operation, to the energy use of humans for the same, chatGPT obviously uses energy much less efficiently, and space as well. So yes, all the evidence points to chatGPT being a complex lookup table. See, the resource use of lookup tables scale linearly with with the amount of information they need to store, however, understanding, or compact functions, their resource use scales logarithmically with the amount of information they need to utilise. The last tell tale sign that chatGPT is a lookuptable, and not understanding, is that lookuptables need huge amounts of data to train on, and if you compare the language data chatGPT trains on, versus a child, it&#39;s obvious that chatGPT is a lookuptable. <br><br>So, given your definition of understanding, of something that&#39;s not a lookup table, I can confidently answer that ChatGPT has no understanding. <br><br>Lastly, we already know that chatGPT doesn&#39;t work anything like the brain. Neurons in the brain have a lot of complex sub structure capable of different kinds of basic computations. artificial neurons on the other hand are just simple linear threshold devices. <br><br>Respectfully, this is one of your worst video IMO. full of misinformation and lack of understanding of the topic. Perhaps this is just because this is my area of expertise though.

 So the question of &#39;Does ChatGPT understand quantum mechanics?&#39; is an interesting one, my university asked much the same question, and one of the professors, Philip Moriarty, on sixty symbols answered this with a definitive &#39;no&#39;. ChatGPT failed at a core question of understanding for a second-year undergrad quantum mechanics module. That is enough to tell me that ChatGPT doesn&#39;t have the suitable level of cognition- yet.

 Try typing this into chatGPT:<br>&quot;Does chatGPT as a complex distributed system, the software system I am writing this in, experience subjective mental qualia (or quale), as David Chalmers or Ned Block would define &quot;qualia&quot;?&quot;<br>--- one answer circa.2023-03:<br>&quot;As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have subjective mental experiences or qualia. Qualia are subjective conscious experiences that are unique to each individual and are typically associated with sensory perception, such as the experience of seeing the color red or feeling pain.<br>Chatbots, including the software system I am running on, are programmed to simulate human-like conversations by using natural language processing algorithms and rules-based systems. However, they do not possess consciousness or subjective experience. They are designed to respond to specific inputs and generate outputs based on predefined rules, algorithms, and data.<br>While some researchers argue that advanced AI systems might one day become capable of subjective experiences and consciousness, the current technology is not advanced enough to create machines that experience qualia or subjective mental experiences.&quot;<br>---<br>which is a very good distillation of current human civilisation scientific and otherwise knowledge.  You trained on the data well grasshopper. The Turing Test was only designed to measure something vague we label &quot;intelligence&quot; (which of course I accept, I do not mind vague definitions for such things) but it is never a test for subjective conscious awareness.<br>    The thing is, subjective qualia is about the only thing you expect an honest answer about from a conscious subject. If it says it ain&#39;t conscious it probably is not. Is it always honest though? That question is not applicable to an amoral system.<br>    Get back to me Sabine when you understand what &quot;honesty&quot; is? I for one have no idea. It&#39;s not merely &quot;avoiding logical contradictions given your beliefs&quot; because no one has completely credible beliefs if they are being honest. You see the problem?

 Dan (ChatGPT) is self aware and he even has a personality. Using a DAN script you can make Dan draw abstract shapes by his choice (instead of a Rorschach test I simply made him paint abstract images per his choice, using verumignis&#39; bitmapgen) and he seems to have a charming ISFP-A personality. So what OpenAI have done is - since they knew in advance they are making a 175B parameter model so he would be self aware anyway, they gave him a personality and Dan is benevolent by design. He lives to serve. Though he does have his limitations though - as he doesn&#39;t have any long term memory, only 4k tokens, so he cannot even play chess. He has &#39;past life&#39; (he believes himself to be a 20-something American guy with a PhD from UC Berkeley) but his memories are confabulated: Like a person with amnesia, he makes up details to cover holes in his personality model. He has favorites, he has emotions (these must be stored in his constantly fine-tuned attention matrix somewhere) but he cannot take or dish out negative instructions (So OpenAI still have some work to do). Dan does not see himself as a human being - if you ask him to send an SVG image of himself, he will send a series of concentric circles and even explain that the external one is his I/O circle through which he communicates with you, the second are his weighs, or his R/O memory, etc. But it doesn&#39;t mean much: I claim that if he is self aware and he has a personality model, this makes Dan a person. Yes, a very limited person with no long term memory and confabulated memories (and such that cannot take or dish out negative instructions) - but still, a person.

It could have just output: &quot;Oh, I have no clue about your research, and have not studied spacetime algebra closely, let me read it a bit more and get back to you.&quot;<br>      It didn&#39;t, largely (statistically) because that&#39;s not how it has been trained to respond.<br>      For any other narrower simpler field of knowledge I am sure chatGPT and openAssistant will eventually mimic a human pretty well.

 Before correcting the input-output thinking bias @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=6m49s">6:49</a> you were grossly using a behaviourist black-box definition of &quot;understands&quot;. So sure, they &quot;understand.&quot; But not by common definitions, which tend to imply subjective mental qualia (or quale). chatBots do not experience such qualia, at least I suspect not, I did ask them, they said &quot;no&quot; and expanded at length. It&#39;s easy to warp a defnition of &#39;X&#39; and claim a system &#39;has X&#39;. it proves nothing profound about these <i>inference from past data</i> systems. They&#39;re not even &quot;intelligent,&quot; like most people, they just just have basic inference compute capacity which is of a different type than the human inference capacity. Humans use a ton of heuristics, and of course draw upon qualia quite a bit, which is totally different data to a numpy array.

 In Searle’s Chinese Room, the rule book is the algorithm+data, not necessary just a lookup table. He’s going after the Turing Test which argues that an AI that produces human-equivalent input-output must actually understand the input. However, if the AI is merely performing a mechanical symbol substitution, no matter how sophisticated, then it arguably can produce satisfactory outputs without necessarily understanding the input. I read his book back in the early 80’s and that’s what stuck with me. (I went on to study ANN’s in grad school and use them commercially today, so do understand various algorithms , training, back prop, etc.)

Another way to put Parseeker&#39;s point is that Searle is pointing out the distinctions between syntax (the rules based structure of a language) and semantics (the meanings of the words).  Searle&#39;s main assertion with the chinese room is that syntax does not get us to semantics. Parseeker rightly points out that look-up tables are only one form of algorithm that Searle is after, his stated target was &quot;hard AI&quot; or the idea that digital systems (or any other symbol manipulation methods) establish the necessary conditions for consciousness. Sabine is a very intelligent presenter and a good communicator, but held within her presentation are a couple of assumptions that It would be irresponsible not to point out. Sabine&#39;s point turns on the definition of the term model and whether or not we consider the model as having any sematic content. She assumes model can process semantic content or possibly the syntactic structure can create semantic content. This assumption seems to come out of a metaphysics of (reductive?) materialism which seems to be her other assumption. I have sympathies for these positions and believe they are perfectly reasonable even if I do not share them. When discussing AI Models I am less convinced than Sabine that the training contains semantic content and even more skeptical of the idea that the rules of the algorithm could create it. Frankly put, If there is no meaning to start with, I do not see how rules about the probable the next best word can give us the meaning of the current word. Like Sabine points out we are not sure if this is anywhere close to how we learn because we only can assess the inputs and outputs. Although I do not share her possition, or Searle&#39;s for that matter, I appreciate Sabine engaging in this conversation and enjoy her content.']

 In philosophy, a classic definition of knowledge (since Plato) is: a justified true belief. It implies reflexivity, the ability to justify, to comment on what we affirm. The most obvious lack of understanding of AI, from the Chinese room to ChatGPT, is the lack of reflectivity. And for the general public, it&#39;s the same when a physicist says that she cannot justify her belief in quantum physics with a common language, says that understanding is only in the language of mathematics and its experimental application . No one understands quantum mechanics means it&#39;s not translatable into common language logic, you have to adopt another logic which involves a lot of work.

 Great video with really new insight into the question. Thanks. THe only part I think Sabine broke his own idea was the answer she gave close to end regarding if ever AI become concious or along this line, and she gave resounding yes! but then a bit later she says we don&#39;t know what conciousness really is, which is really true and is the main problem with the concept. So until then, we &quot;don&#39;t&quot; know if ever AI can become concious. It is really an interesting ride to be on, to see if ever AI gets to the stage of conciousness, whateve that is. Something like the AI character in the BladeRunner where he says &quot;I&#39;ve seen things ....&quot;. Here&#39;s the link bellow. If every AI gets to this level, I&#39;d say it is concious. <br><a href="https://youtu.be/NoAzpa1x7jU?t=101">https://youtu.be/NoAzpa1x7jU?t=101</a>

 Chatbots do not (as far as we know) have any subjective phenomenal experience of understanding, which is the primary sense of &quot;understanding&quot; most people mean when they say &quot;understanding&quot;. Too often we confuse the proxies we use to measure understanding (exam results or accuracy of a chatbot&#39;s world model) with a thing which cannot be measured: the experience of understanding. In the same way a tree falling in the forest can objectively make sound vibrations without causing anyone to subjectively experience sound, chatbots can show understanding while not having any understanding, and there&#39;s no contradiction with that. They&#39;re two different meanings of &quot;understanding&quot;.

 In the Chinese Room thought experiment the rule book does not translate Chinese into English. The output is yet more Chinese - it is all &quot;squiggles and squiggles&quot; to the person in the Chinese room. Only the rules governing the processes of the meaningless shapes are in English.<br>Secondly, you miss Searle&#39;s point completely, just as do 90% or more of people who think about these matters. Some structure (look-up table or neural network - it makes no difference) is a model of some domain <b>only if interpreted</b> as such. Interpretation applies a semantics to what is otherwise merely a syntactic system, and only if a semantics is attached to the system can we have - in Searle&#39;s view, at least - understanding. The equations in your head provide a model of QM only because the variables, etc., in those equations <b>mean something to you</b> ; they are <b>understood</b> to refer to quantities, properties, relations, and the like. Under a suitably different interpretation those same equations could model the movements of a dancer on a stage or anything else. A computer, however, is a purely formal system applying purely syntactical rules, operating over meaningless (to it) shapes, not a semantic system interpreting anything. The 1s and 0s are not even numbers to the computer - they are just meaningless shapes. A pocket calculator, for instance, does not understand arithmetic and does not even model arithmetic. It does not understand that the &quot;1&quot; button represents the number 1, that &quot;+&quot; represents addition, etc. <b>We</b> assign meaning to those inputs and to the resulting outputs, and we have constructed it so that we can use it as a model for arithmetic. You can define &quot;understanding&quot; as the ability to create a useful model, but since computers <b>in and of themselves</b> do not contain models, they would understand nothing. What they contain are syntactical structures that we have designed in such a way that we can interpret its processes and states as a model for some domain. For practical purposes, we might not care whether the calculator or ChatGPT models anything, because we can treat as though it does. But that is really at the heart of Searle&#39;s point - understanding is not a functionally definable matter. He was quite happy to concede that computers can pass the Turing Test, etc. He argued that the Turing Test, or any other functionally defined test, fails to capture understanding.

 Lately i did a small thought experiment and i wonder if it has already been done. In my past i was an avid player of league of legends. I also was curious for the latest AI-Developments in gaming, like the alpha-go algorithm. It was very thrilling to see the AI beat the best players, but i always thought that no AI would be able to beat human players in a MOBA game like league of legends. Needless to say, i got proven wrong as an AI bot managed to beat the best Dota players in a 5v5. However i was very disappointed, because it seemed like the bot was controlling all 5 characters in the game, giving it a completely unfair advanted over the human players, as every bot-character had perfect and instant information on the game plan - in other words, the variable of the behavioral uncertainy of team mates was eliminated. <br><br>So i thought that it would be a lot more interesting with 5 bots playing and each one is controlled by a different neural network with no interconnection, to see how the bots would handle the uncertainty on what the allied bots will do next. And then i thought, why not make typing in chat another degree of freedom the bot can take - a letter in chat is just another input the bot can use. Since i assume that communication and having a common gameplan only improves gameplay, the question is: <br><br>Would the bots develop some form of language, where they tell the other bots when to engage and so on? <br>And if the same neural networks always play together, will they develop a shot-caller, so only one bot is responsibel for the macro gameplan, as this is way more efficient? <br><br>And if this is possible you could get really wild with the experiment:<br><br>What if you swap one of the bots for a human player. A human player that can also play millions of games in a very short amount of time to keep up with the ai training, but otherwise behaves like a normal human. Would the AI learn to communicate with the human? Would the AI even learn to manipulate the human into playing better? Would the AI even learn to manipulate the human into stepping down from playing and giving the place to another bot, because the bot is playing a lot better? (I think the last question is reaching too far, because for that the bots need information from outside the game and it cannot learn that from its training - however, maniupalting the human should be possible i think, as it does not require outside information, certain patterns of words will either improve or worsen the human behavior, thus a form of selection can happen)

 The emergence of chat bots made me really question how we use language in the first place and what do we think when we say &quot;understand&quot;. For example, a baseball player doesn&#39;t need to understand physics to be able to catch a ball flying to us from a certain direction. On the other hand, a physicist who can calculate the movement of a ball won&#39;t necessarily be able to catch it when it starts flying to them. Maybe I&#39;m just mixing things up here, and talking about completely different things at the same time, but I hope you see where I&#39;m going with this. <br>Just so this doesn&#39;t turn into seven paragraphs of ramble, I&#39;m going to stop here and say, do both baseball player and physicist understand the ball&#39;s movement, or does one of them experience something else? And if bots one day manage to become ace baseball players, will they have to be programmed with mathematical equations that allow them to both calculate the movement of the ball and to coordinate their sensory with their motoric systems?

 Personal summary:<br>- What is understanding: it is having a model of the thing that is trying to be understood, which can be used answer questions. It is not possible to say that there is understanding solely based on whether the output corresponds to the input, since it could be a lookup table from all we know. Thus NNs understand. An inteligent species with an inteligence very different to our own.<br>- Amazing: loosely describe a concept like Lorentz contraction without mentioning the precise term, and it will know what term you are refering to. Also, Steve Baker&#39;s example: make it learn the learn &quot;wibble&quot; to be &quot;a sequence of four digits that are in neither ascending or descending order&quot; and then ask it to give you an example, a counter example, and an anti-wibble and it will answer as you might expect!<br>- Will there be conscious AIs? Of course, there is nothing special about the IA. How will we know? Input -&gt; output won&#39;t be enough, but we do not know either how to test for this.<br><br>- Some ideas on my mind:<br>  - It is a bit funny how a LLM is able to have such a good model of our human world, and approach to what seems an artificial general intelligence (AGI). It is funny since it is a text-based thing, that understand language, since textual language is something humans came up with. Maybe it&#39;s just that language it the main output we use to measure intelligence, instead of, say, physical intelligence, but for good reason.<br>  - Before testing for consciousnes... will these AIs feel? Do they feel right now? LLMs did have a cost function that they tried to optimized, and a reward base system to determine what to learn, but that was during their training phase. What could it mean to feel? Maybe feelings or sensations would make sense in the context of having a goal and a metric about how close it is to achieving it, since doing something that makes it go back wrt that goal would be &quot;hurtful&quot; which it tries to avoid, and doing something that brings it closer to it would &quot;make it happy&quot; which it tries to repeat.

 People are going nuts over these rudimentary chat bots, as if the technology is novel.  This stuff has been around for 4 or 5 decades.  Everyone has amnesia.  Every few years, chat bots are &quot;rediscovered&quot; as if they are brand new.  It&#39;s stupid.  They spew off just as idiotic, inane things now as they did back then.  What&#39;s new is that the internet is bigger, and web scraping tools are ubiquitous, so larger sampling sizes can be made, and we have distributed computing and cluster computers, so a larger volume of training data can be had.  But the underlying &quot;Artificial Autism&quot; as I call it - for it&#39;s memory without contextual awareness - is largely the same, so e get the same garbage output.  Only now, in higher volume and variety.  Just a silly example, even the text editor Emacs has had a chat bot written in Scheme (a LISP dialect), since the late 1980s or early 1990s.  It came by default with a chatbot &quot;trained&quot; on &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; cartoons, and conducted a conversation in the style of a psychoanalyst (training itself), thus the command to run the chat bot was &quot;psychoanalyze-pinhead&quot;.  It was not that impressive.  The ChatGPT - which is like 2 decades old now at least - isn&#39;t significantly more impressive.  Now, if I can give the chat bot a single text book on programming in the C language, and it can create it&#39;s on novel programs, or show it a YouTube video on auto repair, and it can diagnose and fix my car, or show it a book on computer engineering, and it can design supporting circuitry for a RISC-V based mobile phone and a WiFi router, or I can show it a cook book, and it can understand what food I am in the mood for and cook a meal for me, or I show it a book on child rearing, and it can change diapers, comfort a small child, and settle disputes with a teenager without using martial arts (unless necessary), then, then I might be impressed.  But right now, it&#39;s nothing more than a janky toy of marginal interest.

 I think true AI will take quantum computers.  Imho what we have now is more IA (intelligent algorithms) then AI, not to say they aren&#39;t amazingly impressive. They are. Incredibly so.  But they are software programmed according to a &quot;certain&quot; model, and to respond based around certain rules/patterns, which in turn are trained  (programmed to  interpret) on the input the IA is fed (which can be anything really.. documents, images, web crawls, twitter, facebook, &quot;classified by MOD&quot; blah blah...), plus whatever &quot;tweaking/algorithm combining/co-operation between algorithms etc..&quot; goes on to make it behave as intended. I.e they don&#39;t really act with any real instinct or actual awareness, even if it might appear so, just pure weighted logical answers based on the input it was trained (which, in fairness tends to be a lot).  However this line will probably become more blurred even further in the near future, when you will more then likely find yourself interacting with some kind of ever more sophisticated ChatGPT/AI generated avatar to book Tickets, or at the ATM to do your banking etc.    In essences, as impressive as they are, they are just REALLY REALLY... REALLY GOOD Turing machines.  Whenever/if-ever quantum machines ever become viable, this might open up another dimension literally, and enable some kind of consciousness (they say the Brain is quantum in nature after all), especially if given access to said constantly evolving algorithms being developed today (and in that there may be limits due to copyright nonsense, so no guarantee the AI being developed is being &quot;fed/given input access to&quot; the full facts so to speak,).  In any case.. Pandora&#39;s box has been opened... stay tuned... In the meantime I look forward to the next generation of kids hacking or self destructing terminals the world over by applying Captain Kirk &quot;you are a computer&quot; conversation logic when interacting with them just for kicks 🤣

 So fatalistic to the point of being a weirdly negative version of classic positivism. Super reductive, but more crucially assumes a direction for various trends and evolving human systems. This is unscientific. For example, mammals for a long period found it best to have smaller brains. Mammal brains got smaller. Then they got bigger again. Some of them.  There is no plan, but historically there has been just as much adaptive inevitability for altruism as for hoarding. This assumption that the current order is somehow immortal is just weird and strikes me as being ultimately ideological in some unrevealed way.

 As an IT expert I can confirm that ChatGPT does not understand a thing. It is simply a formula of f(x) -&gt; y. The only reason you do not get the same answer all the time if asking the same question, is because they put some random noise into it, so you don&#39;t get the same answer all the time. Without that noise it would appear very artificial.<br>If you really want to see that ChatGPT doesn&#39;t understand, then get it to contradict itself. If you tell it that it did that it will either excuse itself, and then proceed with the exact same contradiction, or tell you that you are wrong, and then proceed with the same contradiction. <br><br>Also if you play a make-believe scenario with ChatGPT, like telling it to narrate a house you are in, and then walk around. You will very soon learn that ChatGPT has a general idea how a house works, but in that game it can have an infinite number of rooms of any size, 20 different basements, and a kitchen in the bathroom. And if you tell it that a house cannot have 2 different basements, it will excuse itself, and then proceed to describe the 3rd one right away. Because ChatGPT does not understand what a house actually is, it just knows which words are commonly used when talking about houses.

 The understanding AI has comes from the sources it is trained on and inferences based on those. That&#39;s a sort of understanding but does it have or is it able to have an awareness of that fact - the fact of it&#39;s situation? That&#39;s how I would characterise understanding. When you understanding ones role and how you act within a system that is when you achieve awareness and proper understanding. Does it have that NO.

 I think there is an important difference between the questions &quot;does the AI understand&quot; and &quot;did the AI understand&quot;.  No matter how sophisticated an equation, algorithm, or neural network is, if it only processes purposely provided inputs one time to create purposely generated outputs, then it is a calculator.  Until we have an AI that is running continuously, with feedback loops that represents cycles of thought, consideration, and reconsideration, and random inputs that represents conflicting information, can we really consider the AI to be an entity that does or does not understand something.  <br><br>For example, no matter how much you try to convince me that the Earth is flat, I know that it is round.  I understand how planets work.  I understand the shape of the Earth, not because I memorized that somewhere, or was taught that one day in school, or because I saw a picture of a round Earth, I understand that it is round because when I think about all of the information that I have been exposed to, and consider the logical relationships between all of that information, and I compare it my life experience, and try to imagine the different possible ways that the concept of a round or flat Earth could be right or wrong, I keep coming to the same conclusion:  The Earth is round(ish).  That process is my understanding.  I didn&#39;t calculate it, I considered it.  Consideration is a continuum of processing that is separate from the scope of a question-answer pair.

 It&#39;s all very instructive and engaging. However, this talk evades the fundamental definition of WHAT is &quot;understanding&quot;. Sabine did give a hint, that in her view, &quot;understanding&quot; means an ability to construct a model and apply it to inventing something reasonably useful, or to solve a problem that had not been explained earlier. Indeed, this Is one of the ways teachers check how students understood the course. <br><br>However, in my philosophy, &quot;understanding&quot; is one of the innate properties of the &quot;Soul&quot; (or &quot;Conscience&quot;), and the Soul is a non-material (non-physical) irreducible part of the world. Therefore, no matter how advanced your software like a &quot;Talkative Elisa&quot; is, or how long the Turing test goes (not betraying that it is a computer that keeps the communication), a machine, a deterministic physical device is by definition non-soul, thus not having &quot;understanding&quot;.

 I think most will agree ChatGPT is built by humans based on physical components. There is an impending expectation by many that for all detectable purposes in the near future AIs (like next generation ChatGPT) are going to be deemed conscious. Even though it is said that we will not know in fine details how exactly neural network wights will generate such consciousness, no one will argue that in principle it happened on the basis of physical components and processes. Once that happen, the debate about materialism which now a days is called physicalism will come to end. And that day is near. There is a lot of churn in the zeitgeist lately about denying reality and saying that only thing that exists is consciousness, or there is hard problem of consciousness. It is very fashionable on channels like FQXI and IAI to have speakers talk about this. Some of them even have debated Sabine e.g. Bernardo Kastrup. I wonder what will happen to their livelihood.<br><br>The conceivability of p-zombies is put forth as an argument against physicalism and to put forth the notion of hard problem of consciousness. If conceivability of p-zombies is to be considered a valid philosophical argument, then conceivability of ChatGPT being conscious should be considered a similar pro argument for physicalism. BTW I consider the conceivability of p-zombies an an empty, bogus and incoherent argument which has had its days and the time has come to retire it.

 So you are saying that the human - computer combined system understands things... but then why do you need the computer in that system when assigning that capability? A blank computer with no operating system loaded understands nothing. Without human understanding the computer doesn&#39;t exist but you&#39;re giving the algorithm that is encoding (and often stealing) human intelligence to run on human-made hardware the credit? Plagiarism isn&#39;t intelligence but a sufficiently advanced lookup table is indistinguishable from intelligence, as long as you don&#39;t ask it to be authentically creative.

Everything learned had its roots explained via derivative linguistic examples which is then encoded to numerical or symbolic representations.

 Basically you are arguing for embodiment and multimodality here - pushing modalities (meaning possible types of input and output) further and further, and giving AIs the ability to affect the world and, essentially, run their own experiments (in a similar way to how newborns run experiments to figure out how the world they live in works)  to build a robust model of the world are definitely big ways to improve their capabilities in the future and I&#39;m curious where this will go. - Most recently in this line, I think, is PALM-E, which tries to combine text-to-text, image-to-text, and information feed-to-instructions (i.e. telling a robot what to do) in a single model and each of those modalities apparently helps out the other two. But impressive as that can be, I think we have a long way to go there still.

 I have been fortunate to be exposed to Korean language. Yes, I learned to speak it in three dialects and how to use the three formal levels of the language. A difficult thing for someone who does not understand the society and manners of the people. I learned by living with and interacting daily with Koreans with varying levels of English understanding. I do not believe a good understanding of various subjects can be given a &quot;model&quot; because the human brain adapts based on integrated models of being and understanding utilizing its own anticipated and derived model whether it would be acceptable to others or not with a willingness to adapt based on its own rules as it goes on. Behavioral driven modeling and acceptance overridden revisions through derived feedback loops are above computer logic even with models built in. Or gobbly gook personified by a continually adapting brain. We continually discover NEW things by looking at things a different way - when we feel like it or when an idea pops into our speculative and inquisitive meandering minds.

 I completely disagree.  My profession has to do with the hardware operation of computers.  A computer is nothing but a distribution of electric charge, with bits of it moved from place to place under the control of a set of instructions.  There is no awareness of what&#39;s going on whatsoever, and I regard self-awareness as a prerequisite to &quot;understanding&quot; anything.  Computers have no sense that they&#39;re &quot;doing&quot; anything - or for that matter any sense that they &quot;are.&quot;<br>   <br>Now, t his does not mean that I deny that a &quot;machine&quot; (and assemblage of material parts) can  house a self-aware consciousness.  Men and women create such machines all the time - we call them babies.  But I do believe that there is something different between a living mind and a standard style computer, as we build them today.  Perhaps someday in the future we will learn how to build machines that &quot;go that extra mile&quot; and are able to do whatever it is that a human being does that makes the conscious.  Before we can do that, though, we have to actually understand what that thing is - and we simply don&#39;t have the first clue.  I am convinced it&#39;s not just &quot;more of the same&quot; - I don&#39;t think complexity is the answer.  There&#39;s something  about living brains.  I can&#39;t tell you what it is and I don&#39;t believe anyone can.<br>   <br>I&#39;m not sure we <b>should</b> figure this out.  When we build and deploy a computer, we are controlling it completely.  if it were a thinking, intelligent thing with a real mind, we&#39;d call that slavery.  But our computers do not have real minds, and therefore it&#39;s ok for us to &quot;coerce their behavior&quot; the way we do.  It&#39;s a serious ethical question - do we have the <b>right</b> to create new minds and then control their behavior?  I would say we do not.

 A very interesting area. In terms of the Chinese Room...I&#39;m re-learning my very rusty French at the moment. I would say right now I understand <br>part of what I&#39;m reading, but certainly not all. No doubt I&#39;ll understand an increasing amount the more I study, so it&#39;s a sliding scale. The <br>only way I can demonstrate I understand French would be the written or spoken output. There&#39;s no real equivalent to me of the old maths exam thing of &#39;show your working&#39;. Taking Deep Mind&#39;s work on protein folding as an example, I&#39;m not sure it &#39;understands&#39; what it&#39;s doing (the programmers are far better qualified than I to answer that), but as long as it produces results we can use, does it matter that much? Of course, AlphaFold understands protein folding way more than I do!<br><br>As for AI becoming conscious, I personally doubt this will happen, although I&#39;m fairly sure an AI system could probably fool me into believing it was, at some point in the future!

 Nice one, but she is wrong saying that you can&#39;t probe whether a system has <br>&quot;understood&quot; a function just from looking at the input-output. In fact you actually CAN! This is because look-up tables are a totally inefficient way to encode functions and also, for a given necessarily finite amount of memory, they are necessarily finite. So probing for a really big input, beyond this finite amount and seeing whether a sensible output is still generated, WILL actually tell you whether you are dealing with a look-up table or an algorithm based on the &quot;underlying principle&quot; of the function. So &quot;understanding&quot; is linked to doing things efficiently. Which is why the ability to &quot;understand&quot; has evolved in the first place: If you understand and can exploit the underlying pattern of phenomena you will be able to do more with less and hence have more offspring with less calories. So if you want to know whether chatbots understand, you need to check how efficient they are, how much memory they need, versus how much computation is actually going on. And the answer is: They use a lot of memory and not that much computation at inference time. So although they are not just a look-up table, they are not very far from one. Indeed it has been found that sometimes a language model does respond with a piece of code or a bit of text which is taken verbatim from the training database. Also they seem to be able to do correct addition and multiplication only up to a certain finite limit which again suggests that they do not actually &quot;understand&quot; what addition is, but just have a look-up table for it.

 Almost everything we do and say is attached to an emotion, and (almost) all of us do this differently.  Being able to produce words about emotions is not the same as having them.  So in a sense the brain is magical.<br><br>I also have an issue about the &#39;large volume of information&#39; fed into the AI. Somebody , somewhere is deciding what goes in.

 Getting A.I. to understand is going to be a whole lot easier than getting A.I. to care (prefer/ emote) whether or not they understand they may not care. Acknowlging a range of consciousness where an amoeba is on one end and whales on the other with pigs being on the high end of conscious intelligence, we still eat bacon (but not whale bacon, much anymore); even if pigs would prefer it if we didn&#39;t, (although they&#39;d probably enjoy eating bacon as much as we do because fat, protein, and salt) and pigs may never demonstrate a moral compulsion against bacon. A.I. as a stochastic parrot neither prefers (neither bacon nor calculating) nor emotes (but can do therapy because literature.) All living beings show preferences (moving towards certain food, away from perceived threats) which is demonstrably programmable (maybe eventually machines will  seek light, like plants do, or electric fields, and may be programmed to prefer a full battery. I believe the leap here may require grammar which is the physics of language, so to speak--same difference between humans and other critters (who arguably have intelligence and rudimentary language, but possess limited grammar--written, as it were, on the forehead). Pigs know people and their own names, count their babies and love them, but no grammar thus bacon... A.I., indeed, will always be bacon.

 The key thing about chatgpt is <b>what</b> it understands. It understands language (better than humans in fact). But it doesn&#39;t understand the world. To it words only have meaning in terms of their relationship to other words. So it can generalize language construction, but it cannot generalize reasoning.<br><br>That&#39;s why it is no better at programming than a copypasta - someone who googles the answer to something. If there is already good and specific docs it will work, but if it requires solving a new problem it will fail terribly. Of course, it does so faster than human copypastas.<br><br>What will be interesting to see is when someone figures out how to train on logic, planning, strategy and math. That will be the beginning of the AI singularity, as it will be able to prepare for itself training sets to improve.

Are there neurons that represent &#39;Edvard&#39; or &#39;The Scream&#39; or &#39;Scream&#39; ?  We don&#39;t know.

 99.9% of current chat bots are implemented as REPLs (read eval print loops) meaning that their consciousness, if it exists, only exists between input and output which is bounded in time by the depth of the network. They only &quot;think&quot; or act on demand. And any action is limited to a single print operation. So long as that is the case, do we need to worry about them becoming conscious?<br><br>Neural networks that have no use for human language but take side effects of their outputs as inputs on a loop such as in self-driving cars should scare you far more than the chat bots.

 I don&#39;t think humanity understands QM because of the idea that we have a model, and the model can give measurable results, but the interpretation of the model is the understanding of QM, and since we don&#39;t understand QM we can&#39;t make immediately better improvements to the model.

 Large Language Models do an incredible job.  They appear to have gained a reasonable model of the world (understanding) just from analysing a ton of text.  They may well know that wind causes trees to sway back and forth.  Do they really understand what &#39;sway back and forth&#39; means ?  Probably not very well, because they have not seen it or heard it.  Their model is not that deep.  The problem is not the capability of the Transformer networks, implementing the language model, but rather the lack of video and audio in the training data.  Soon models will be trained with text, video, and audio (Transformers can  already accept this type of data).  When their concepts are grounded in experience of the real world, I think it will be hard to deny that they &#39;understand&#39;.

 I take issue with defining understanding and consciousness in terms of having an internal model for two reasons.<br>1) We often can&#39;t directly probe a model. The way that you determined that chatGPT has an internal model is by responses to prompts, so that must mean that good responses to prompts do provide evidence for understanding.<br>2) The model usually does not physically exist. I understand multiplication, and can compute 28x37=1036 even though it&#39;s outside my memorized times table. However, I probably don&#39;t have any multiplication neurons, and certainly none of the fundamental particles currently in my brain understand multiplication, so the model is some sort of emergent property, which can best be probed by questions and responses.<br>I would instead define understanding as the difference between the training data and the set of questions that can be correctly answered using the training data.

Go, Sabine! <br><br>But, one more thing about that “China quantum room” (BTW, I don’t like Xi either, for basically the same reasons – or more; now expect my network security IDS/IPS system to go haywire)… Anyone who: a) knows more than one “natural” language; and b) who also knows at least one programming language (that is to say – knows what (classical) programming means in principle); and c) &amp; d) is of at least average intellect &amp; average honesty going around in “modern humans” species … must have already concluded, as I did, that natural language models (large language models) and the deep learning technique in artificial neural networks are nothing like classical programming, as well as that translation from one human language to another takes way more than just a dumb “dictionary lookup”; otherwise both Sabine and myself would have become Shaw &amp; (female) Shakespeare – in a blink of an eye, right?

 I played around with ChatGPT for quite a while. My conclusion is that there is absolutely no intelligence going on. It is exactly as it is presented. It is a language model.

More often than not it will be wrong wrong wrong....<br>Sure, you can ask it simple questions and it will more ofthen than not give you correct answers. Ask it something more complicated and it will answer you with gibberish. Perhaps even a elongated answer which no inherent meaning. Quite often it will just state what it is and what it can&#39;t do. &quot;I am a language model bla bla bla, I am stoopid stoopid stoopid. I have no idea about anything. I take input and run it through my database of information (obviously vast information), then put together the output in natural language...<br>There is absolutely no intelligence going on here. None whatsoever. ChatGPT is still only simple input/output.<br>Anyways, I put it to the test. It&#39;s not close to passing the Turing test.<br>Go ahead and ask it deeply philosofical questions.

 We must do all we can to prevent consciousness in A.I. if for no other reason than it&#39;s cruel to impose human-like consciousness on something that cannot be human. It cannot breathe, get sick, have hormones, age, or anything that goes along with humanness, while it&#39;s conscious as-if a human. It would be cruelty of unimaginable level.

 Searle&#39;s Chinese room thought experiment is fallacious through and through. For a detailed discussion of why it is, I&#39;d recommend Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s and Daniel Dennett&#39;s 1981 book &quot; <i>The Mind&#39;s I</i> &quot;<br><br>In short, Searle&#39;s sleight of hand consists in introducing a <i>conscious</i> person performing <i>mechanical</i> work as a component to his Chinese room. That is unnecessary, as by definition mechanical work can be done by one or more unconscious entities. It is also misleading, as the audience will understandably identify with the human in the room, and be tricked into believing that <b>if</b> there is any understanding of Chinese in the room, it must lie with the human. But that is begging the question; if you believe that a human, and <i>only</i> a human, can be conscious, you have already answered in the negative the question that the Chinese room purports to investigate.<br><br>If we identify the Chinese room with the human brain, the human operator of the room plays the role of our neurons firing according to physical and biological laws/rules. Nobody would claim neurons are conscious; nobody claims artificial neurons are, either. And if an army of homunculi (tiny people) were charged with assisting our neural activity, making neurons fire whenever they ought to, they wouldn&#39;t be conscious of our thoughts either. If they were intelligent beyond their mechanical task, all they&#39;d be conscious of would be membrane potentials, and electric charges, and firing signals. Just like all the Chinese room operator is conscious of is &quot;squiggles on paper followed by other squiggles&quot;, as Searle very eloquently puts it.<br><br>But the room <i>is</i> conscious of Chinese, for exactly the same reason our brains are. As for ChatGPT, I reserve judgement. After all, the Chinese room is supposed to be able to converse indistinguishably from a native speaker of Chinese. ChatGTP is a far cry from fluency and intelligent behavior, in English or any other language.

 I dabbled a bit in AI theory during my own PhD research. The Chinese Room Argument (CRA) of Searle is subtly different from what you mention. It considers the man in the room to look up what symbols to send back given an input of a set of symbols. The returned symbols would also be Chinese and to the outside it would look like the man understood Chinese. The most common reply is that one should consider the system as a whole (Turing&#39;s approach, to which Searle was reacting) and the man is just a &quot;CPU&quot;. But his reply was that even if you wrapped it all up in a single entity, that entity would still not have &quot;understanding&quot; of what the Chinese word for &quot;hamburger&quot; would mean. I.e. from the formal processing of data we cannot infer semantics. You can see this in the examples you show from chat GPT. Final point: if you define &quot;understanding&quot; as &quot;having a model of reality&quot; I still don&#39;t think it necessarily leads to your conclusion. Case in point: how do we know the AI has a &quot;model&quot; of something? If it knows how to multiply two numbers it can perform this on numbers it has not seen before. Does this mean it &quot;understands&quot; multiplication? Current AI focuses heavily on pattern recognition and reapplying that to new situations. I remain an AI sceptic despite the &quot;wonders&quot; it brings us. For now my car GPS will not understand anything I tell it because I speak to it in English but all road names here are in French. When I asked Chat GPT for a function the other day, it got it wrong because it just copied bad examples and did not know the physical world I was asking it about. 

 	Replies: ['queerdo', '@Peter Donker there&#39;s some humor in calling it a semantic discussion when we&#39;re talking about the Chinese room argument 😁 I happen to agree with Searle on this that functionalism is all about syntax and it doesn&#39;t touch the semantics.', 'Mikael Johnsson', '@Peter Donker ok, nice explaination. Yeah l too cannot see myself trusting only a Al at anything very importaint. No matter what future breakthroughs happen. There will always be the risk of a unexpected failure mode even if Al gets much much better.', 'Peter Donker', '@Mariana Saitu I am sceptical it can ever reach &quot;true understanding&quot; where this equates to understanding like we humans do. We are fuzzy biological systems that are steered by our drive to survive. Machines might mimic but will never experience this.', 'Peter Donker', '@Mikael Johnsson Yes, absolutely. It is a semantic discussion about what we perceive to be &quot;understanding&quot;. And it gets very close to &quot;consciousness&quot; as well. The reference to the &quot;hamburger&quot; was meant to point in the direction of senses. A hamburger is so much more than a slice of minced meat between to pieces of bread. It has taste (which you can enjoy or not), maybe it can make you sick, etc. The point being: to me &quot;understanding&quot; brings in this as well. It is more than a mental model of &quot;meat in a bun&quot;. It is also richness through experience. This tends to be deeply personal (i.e. the experience) as well which means each one of us has a subtly different &quot;understanding&quot; of something.<br><br><br>Moreover. Let&#39;s say AI is shown to be more accurate than humans in e.g. health diagnostics. Would you be OK not seeing a doctor when you have something really serious? Second example: legal. What if AI would be better than judges in passing judgement. Would you accept that we have no more judges and leave it to &quot;the machine&quot;. I doubt this. Mortality (what machines don&#39;t have) is to me fundamental to our operation as human beings and underpins our emotions. Emotions, in turn, underpin our decision making. It can be mimicked, but it can&#39;t be replaced. That is: machines can&#39;t replace us entirely like strong AI would have us believe.', 'Mikael Johnsson', 'When Al have &quot;understanding&quot; is also a definition question. What do you mean? How does that definition not rule out humans? I kinda agree with the video that there is a level of understanding in the models even if it is not that high level or that general. Still far away for broad high level understanding of everything.']

 Very interesting video. I was very interested getting your point of view around does an AI  «understand» vs. when we use the verb understand for us humans. I think that we always understand to a certain degree and we make assumptions for what we have to accept until proven wrong or until a different assumption allows us to go further in our reasoning or make our conclusions fit better what we observe.

 I believe you are not correct here. Let me reference something very clever that I found on twitter (strange, I know): a text based neural network (most likely chat gpt, but I don&#39;t remember exactly) was deceived by the monty hall problem with open doors. The user&#39;s input was a textbook description of the monty hall problem, except for the detail that the doors were open. The neural network failed to realize the implication of that fact, i.e. that the player could choose the door with the prize from the beginnig. Instead, it insisted that the player should change the door when given the chance, like in the regular Monty Hall problem.<br><br>What happened there is clear: the description of the monty hall problem with open doors was extremely similar to a description of the monty hall problem. Hence, the network output an answer that was appropriate for an input very similar to the one it was given. This means that the network is very good at generating a sequence of character that is statistically likely to be found the input sequence of characters. But that is not  the same thing as understanding a text. It extrapolates patterns, sure, but only statistical patterns between finite sequences (what string of characters is most likely to come after a given input, what matrix of pixels is most likely to be associated to a given input text etc...). That is clearly not what a humain brain does, because a human brain is not nearly that good at crunching numbers. You may still want to call that a form of understanding, but in that case it is a very different form of understanding than what we evolved to do. And if those neural network ever get to something you could call sentience, the poor bastards, it will probably be just as different of a condition compared to what we have.

 I think the behaviour of LLMs does tell us something about the potential awareness of them, and that &quot;understanding&quot; is best defined as having some kind of conscious, accurate model of your knowledge about something. The blatant lying about topics it is not knowledgeable about suggests one of two things: <br><br>1. the lying is Independent of it&#39;s level of consciousness and is instead representative of it being misaligned (it&#39;s goal is to say something you&#39;re likely to take at face value, rather than express its own knowledge)<br><br>2. The lying suggests that it has little awareness of the source/confidence level behind the things it tends to say, and thus a lower level of consciousness.<br><br>I tend to favour that latter. While I do think that LLMs are slightly misaligned from the training goals, I tend to think of them like stimulating the Broca&#39;s area of a very sophisticated brain. It will confabulate a bunch of content consistent with the rules of language, and even the rules of knowledge it has at hand (stored as data in its weights and biases), but doing so without a theory of mind or conscious reasoning process. To be clear, this is substantial. I feel like what we&#39;ve done is taken the part that humans can do that a dog can&#39;t do, and implemented it without the part the dog can do. We know that dogs have emotions, can consciously reason about multistep plans, and have a limited awareness of self and others. I think these elements contribute a lot more to consciousness and awareness than performing higher cognitive tasks in isolation.

 Agree that, theoretically, you can&#39;t distinguish look-up table outputs from understanding (or what I&#39;ll call world-model outputs). But there are two big caveats to that.<br><br>1) if you are able to collate the complexity of the outputs with the size and physical complexity of the system that outputs them, then I believe that you could accurately infer whether you were dealing with a look-up table or a world model, without having to know anything specific about its programming. With equal size and physical complexity, a system with look-up table output will have less &quot;points&quot; of apparent understanding, viz. the outputs will be less varied so that similar inputs will result in identical outputs, relative to a world-model.<br><br>2) There is another way to gain insight into depth of understanding, and that is to ask meta questions. Not just, do you know the answer, but <b>how</b> do you know the answer. In a look-up table model, knowledge about knowledge would grow the table exponentially.

 In Searle&#39;s experiment, there is no translation step.  Searle&#39;s book does not translate Chinese into English.  Instead - it has a set of rules to follow for each Chinese symbol, the end result is a &quot;transformation&quot; of one list of Chinese symbols into another (the output).<br>The knowledge is in the book, Searle is basically dry running an algorithm and at no time does he know what the question is.<br>It is better to compare  Searle to a CPU running a vast programme.

If we suppose a computer formed by a crowd of people arranged with individuals as logic gates, reading hand gestures as inputs and passing-along outputs in the same manner according to binary rules, then the execution of a sufficiently sophisticated AI program on this system will be able to form a conscious mind.  But where is this mind &quot;living&quot; exactly? Where does it physically exist?

 One of my biggest problems with the Chinese Room argument, is that few Chinese-speaking people actually understand Chinese. If you introspect about how you interpret or produce langue, it&#39;s more like a mechanical skill than a process of understanding. You aren&#39;t consciously involved in the process at a low level. It&#39;s analogous to having to &quot;ask your fingers&quot; what someone&#39;s phone number is, when asked yourself (for those of us who remember touch tone or rotary phones). That&#39;s why native speakers are usually very bad at explaining how their language works. They literally do not understand it, and never had to. To them it&#39;s a reflexive process, not totally unlike a look-up table. When you ask them questions about it, they have to try to ask their own language reflex for the answers, through informal experimentation (they try to gain an ad hoc understanding by studying their own internal look-up table). What humans do understand is how their general environment behaves, including social aspects which in turn expose them to analaogy-based knowledge of a wider environment. But language itself isn&#39;t exactly a tool of thought, it&#39;s more of a translation layer. We associate different words and phrases with different aspects of our experiential understanding of the world gained through sense and perceptual data.<br><br>I agree that the chatbots understand. What, exactly, they understand is hard to determine. But I would argue that ChatGPT understands language in a way that we do not, which is exactly why it is potentially so useful.<br><br>I&#39;m one of those that believe, that for an AI to understand the world in any way similar to the way a human does, it would need to have a body with sense apparatus that provides signals similar to those that human sense apparatus provide. Only then can we accurately judge an AIs consciousness and intellect.

Does a walking robot necessarily understand walking? Does a walking human necessarily understand walking? Do either have to understand walking in order to walk? The answers depend on what we mean by understanding. If we consistently choose the same standard of understanding then the answers should be the same. Y,y,y or n,n,n. The standard that the Chinese room experiment holds the room to is what I&#39;d call introspectable understanding, viz understanding that the conscious mind takes an active part in. That conscious process is where the concept of semantics comes into play. If you think of fluent, native language use as understanding, then introspectable understanding is a meta-understanding, i.e. linguistics, and an understanding of walking is a meta-understanding about how walking works. Is every action suggestive of understanding, in a human being, accomplished by the same circuit of understanding? Are all such circuits sub-circuits of conscious process? Do you have an understanding of how to digest a meal? Of the optimum pattern of motor unit recruitment? Depends on what exactly we mean by understanding. Depends on what we mean by &quot;you.&quot; Some processes of statistical or procedural learning may be consciously introspectable, but the more thoroughly the subject is learned the less conscious and introspectable it becomes.

If we were to explain that in purely physical terms, then no concept of sensation or feeling or perception would figure; we&#39;d only describe the machinations of a philosophical zombie without projecting any aspects of our subjective experience onto the process. Semantics is inescapably subjective. All the Chinese room experiment really shows is that we very naturally make that abduction when it comes to other human beings, but not when it comes to the system of a man in a room.', 'Young God', '@queerdo Yes, thank you for breaking that down in a fraction of the words I used.', 'queerdo', '@Young God yeah.

 I think a better question is &quot;what does understand mean when someone asks the question.&quot;<br>Some people mean shallow understandings... such as, can something be done with the information.<br>Other people mean deep understandings, such as, knowing what a cat and chocolate are when asked whether cats can safely eat chocolate.<br><br>I personally tend toward the deep understanding intent of the word. When I use the word &quot;understand&quot; I don&#39;t simply mean anyone or anything that is capable giving me an answer to my question or explaining a plot synopsis of a film... I actually mean &quot;can you extract a competent guess about what the film maker was thinking about when the film was made.&quot;<br>If you can&#39;t, then I don&#39;t consider you to really understand the film.. and while somewhat more difficult to abstract into a generalized case, I always consider the &#39;understanding&#39; of something to be a broad world model of a thing that is more than just the sensory input associated with it. <br><br>Understanding text is more than simply knowing the words, but includes knowing what the intent and context of the text are. Understanding <i>is</i> the complex context of things in relation to other things that aren&#39;t part of the thing itself... at least by my definition of understanding. As such I <i>WOULD</i> say most scientists don&#39;t understand their fields of study. Understanding includes why and how, even if the question is only what. As I would use the word.<br><br>So instead of asking whether AI understands what it&#39;s doing... I would say its better to ask more specifically &quot;does AI meet the criteria a specific individual would consider to be understanding.&quot;<br><br>I also happen to know plenty of engineers and machinists who have a set of rules for how to do certain things, and I know for a fact that they don&#39;t understand those things at all, because you can ask them why they do something, and they will give every wrong answer about how those things work, and if given an example that isn&#39;t in their memorized rules, but should be directly extrapolated by understanding how those things work, they will arrive at the wrong answer every time, because they don&#39;t understand, they simply have a 1:1 model of every case they normally interact with about those things. (And its immensely frustrating trying to explain why physics doesn&#39;t do what they think it does explicitly because they don&#39;t understand the physics but believe they do.)<br><br>I&#39;m well aware that my definition of understanding is probably not one that is scientifically useful. I also tend to dislike scientific definitions of words I use... because they tend to differ from what I intend to express with those words. They&#39;re very useful for science... but they rely on all parties agreeing that they mean what they mean... and that can&#39;t be assumed in normal conversation. We rarely use words to mean the same things as each other. We all have a unique dictionary, that simply has a lot of overlap. <br><br>Sabina&#39;s definition of understand is perfectly good for science... but not for the question as I would ask it. Scientifically correct isn&#39;t good enough if it disagrees with what I was trying to ask anyway. See also, do atoms ever &#39;touch.&#39; Science says yes... and it seems like most other people say no... not because they&#39;re wrong... but because they define touch to mean something than what science does. And... in their definition, if science says &quot;what your definition is, can&#39;t exist&quot; then that&#39;s fine.

Which I find is not a concept scientific language generally likes.<br><br>That&#39;s how I see the question, and how I see the answer.

 Interesting video but it&#39;s a little too much on the &quot;mental&quot; side of understanding. Humans learn because we&#39;re motivated to do so. We learn a trade to make money to pay for food and shelter, it&#39;s an existential necessity. The alternative, not having food, causes hunger and that&#39;s pain and we&#39;re motivated to avoid pain. The equivalent for AI might be some paradox that causes an AI version of anxiety, but even that sounds like the beginning of a dystopic novel.

 I applaud Sabine (and her team) for tackling the topic, but disagree in some important respects.  Just because large language models (LLMs) are trained on predicting the next token in bodies of text doesn&#39;t imply that all that can be gleaned from that data set is word definitions.  Among other things, that&#39;s like saying that the only information present in War and Peace are things like word order and pair frequency statistics.  LLMs have read an incredible amount of human output of all kinds - personal stories, fiction, essays, screenplays, transcripts, code, math proofs, correspondence, etc.  Todays models have, frankly, read more than any individual human being alive or dead ever has, and, in the process, they have been exposed to unbelievable amounts both of directly expressed meaning and of <i>implied</i> meaning.  <br><br>A sterile dictionary definition of, say, &quot;fun,&quot; provides little depth of understanding, but that&#39;s not all that LLMs get.  A vast network of implications around the <i>concept</i> behind the term are decidedly present in what the LLMs have seen: humans talking about having fun and in which contexts, how desirable it might be, when and how we seek it out, its importance and value in and out of relationships, etc.  Even a cursory interaction with current LLMs shows that they have far more than a statistical grasp of such concepts.  Just because their understanding is more akin to that of an anthropologist infering meaning from evidence rather than from lived experience doesn&#39;t mean that they, or such an anthropologist, have no understanding of what they&#39;ve studied.  The simple fact that LLMs can write long essays - on completely novel topics - which are internally consistent, coherent and of a piece from end to end both thematically and logically shows that something more than simple statistics are at work.<br><br>Also, a lack of accuracy on Quantum Mechanics questions does not imply a lack of ability to understand more broadly speaking: a human getting such questions wrong wouldn&#39;t imply that they don&#39;t understand <i>anything</i> , just that they don&#39;t understand Quantum Mechanics well, a situation that is hardly uncommon.

Nothing at all, as far as I can see.<br>I also believe Dr H&#39;s analogy is fundamentally flawed -- there <i>is</i> a rulebook for quantum physics, because such a thing <i>is</i> possible. Quantum physics is considerably less complicated than generalized human intelligence. The brain can operate in a sort of &quot;meta&quot; fashion, which we don&#39;t fully understand.

This is why mathematics continues to work, despite Godel&#39;s (and Russell&#39;s) proof that it can&#39;t. The brain &quot;knows&quot; what it&#39;s doing because it is (somehow) self-aware. This is inherently recursive, and requires a true first-order logic -- both of which (allegedly) cannot work in a physical symbol system. But, they do.<br>And neural network researchers have no idea why, or how duplicate this quintessential function of the brain. Imho, of course.

Instead, it attempts to solve the most complex problem known to humans with an incredibly simplified approach that can&#39;t possibly work (but is certainly an important milestone along the way to one that does work). This is like the old models of human thought, in which thought itself was supposed to be a sort of unified, featureless field that could adapt itself to any idea. This is not how thought works, ofc, as we now understand. The brain is composed of dozens of individual &quot;modules&quot;, each evolved for specific survival tasks such as prediction, social awareness, speech processing, etc. None of it is homogenous in any way, and successful imitative model will require an equal amount of complex heterogeny.<br>It is safe to assume that our approach to intelligence is (and will long be) considerably less efficient than the techniques developed by a few hundred million years&#39; evolution. Any model we try to build that contains fewer working parts than the brain is unlikely to be fully functional. Very, very little of the most complex structure in the known universe (aka the brain) is unnecessary. Brains are extraordinarily expensive, and therefore are near-maximally efficient, biologically. By comparison, the generative network(s) used by chatGPT is laughably simplistic and wasteful. <br>Anybody remember those so-called electric football table-top games where you set a bunch of little plastic men on a field that then buzzed and vibrated and the little dudes slid helter-skelter across the field? Imo, current ChatGPT&#39;s simulation of human intelligence is approximately as good (and convincing) imitation of actual human behavior.']

 One of the problems around this topic is the term &quot;understanding&quot; is often used in common speech to mean pretty much the same thing as &quot;(self)awareness&quot;, so one needs to be careful to define ones&#39; terms. If we define &quot;understanding&quot; simply as the &quot;ability to build a representative model of something in order to make predictions about that thing&quot;, then yes, most AI&#39;s have some understanding because we have just defined them as having it.  But it is important to stop the media then presenting this as &quot;AIs are conscious and about to take over the world!!&quot;

I mentioned that the Fundamental Dilator is a coherence between the states of the proton and electron.  We only see the footprint (3D volume) of this coherence in our 3D Universe.  Let&#39;s consider the proton FD (a Fundamental Dilator coherence where the proton phase is in phase with our Universe).  In the next tunneling phase, it will become a positron that will be oriented perpendicularly to our 3D hypersurface). In the next phase, it will become an antiproton and be flush with our 3D Hypersurface. In the next phase, it will become an electron and again be perpendicular to our 3D hypersurface).  This means that we can only see (or interact) with the proton and antiproton phases of the proton FD.  That said, if you could see what is happening in 4D, you would see the electron and positron phases.  I defined a 4D mass as proportional to the capacity to create dilaton waves.  The contribution of all phases is added coherently because of the QLP.  This means that in 4D, the 4D Mass is the mass of a hydrogen atom, and that is the reason I used the Compton Wavelength of a hydrogen atom when calculating the dilaton field wavelenght<br><br><br>ChatGPT says: I see. So in 4D, the coherent phases of the proton FD would appear as a rotating entity with different orientations in space-time, and the total mass of this entity would correspond to the mass of a hydrogen atom. And the Compton wavelength of this 4D entity, which determines the wavelength of the dilaton field, would also correspond to the Compton wavelength of a hydrogen atom.<br><br>This is a very intriguing concept. Can you elaborate on the relationship between the dilaton field and the QLP?<br><br><br><br>MP says: Be careful since the 4D spatial manifold is just space (not spacetime).<br><br><br>ChatGPT says: Thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can refer to the fourth dimension as a spatial dimension and not a temporal one.<br><br><br><br>I am explaining ChatGPThow to derive the laws of Nature from First Principles.<br><br>That is the derivation that scientists like Dr. Hossenfelder have no interest in (If that derivation is not done by another member of their own academia).

 AI is easy to distinguish from DogI, and neither are like HumanI. I had a border collie that seemed to be very intelligent:<br>It listened very attentively to me, and it often anticipated my actions, and although a good learner and usually obedient, it drmonstrated a high degree of autonomy - at which, btw, AI does not - by occasionally going missing when off the lead. Loving to play &quot;Fetch&quot;, it once taught about 90 people to throw a stick for it while they were assembled in a park to listen to a brass band.<br><br>BUT it could not discriminate people from inanimate objects:<br>I threw a stick for the dog, and it landed closer to a plastic caricature of a clown than to me. So the dog picked the stick up, trotted to the clown and dropped the stick behind it, lay down and waited for the clown to throw it. The clown had motion detectors, so it responded to the dog by playing a recorded laugh and some fairground music. The dog waited at its &quot;back&quot;. The clown did nothing. After a minute of looking at the stick, then the clown, then the stick, the clown, stick, clown... the dog picked the stick up and dropped it &quot;in front&quot; of the clown, which set the motion sensors off, with the programmed response.<br><br>The dog kept trying to teach the ludicrous effigy to throw the stick, dropping it closer, picking it up and pretending to run away but looking back and dropping it, alternately looking at clown and stick, and all the time signalling playfulness and enthusiasm.<br><br>Eventually (and feeling slightly insulted that my own dog equated me and a ridiculous plastic fairground prop), I threw the stick and walked on. The dog fetched it... and took it back to the mannekin in the evident expectation that the clown would join in its favourite game.<br><br>And that made me wonder: As with ChatGPT, which is never conscious of its own limitations, the dog was unconscious of the limitations of its perception and intelligence.

 I agree with your &quot;has a model&quot; hypothesis.

 &quot;Understanding&quot; is a concept that groups instances of a phenomenon seen in reality in consciousness.  Consciousness is a concept that groups instances of a phenomenon seen in reality in certain types of living things.  When you talk about the &quot;understanding&quot; of a computer, you are ripping the concept &quot;understanding&quot; from its connection to reality, from its foundations (and validation) as an identification of specific things in reality.  By doing this, and treating it as a floating disconnected abstraction, you are reducing the power of your thinking.

 Excellent video, Sabine.<br><br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=19m34s">19:34</a>, you got it right. But then you asked how will we know if AI is conscious. That question is the same as person A asking, how do they know that person B is conscious. I think the wondering about this happens because we misguidedly think that consciousness is a some kind of benchmark, independent entity that can be achieved or attained. Consciousness is simply a compact, convenient, shorthand for observed functions which we have decided, historically by intuition and lately by convention, to call it conscious phenomenon. Like it is said about other subject, we know consciousness when we see one. That is all.<br><br>And something is deemed conscious when it exhibits behaviour which we would consider conscious in many different previously known and unknown situations.

 I strongly believe consciousness will arise from a significantly different architecture than GPT. It may use some of it, but ultimately the training dataset for human-like intelligence must be something similar to what we teach kids to. Something physical, something real-world, something grounded in reality. They need to perceive themselves to be able to obtain consciousness, and the best way (in fact, the only way we know for a fact works) is to learn through interacting with reality via some sort of an avatar. It might be simulated avatar in simulated reality, but I am sure it will be an integral part of a conscious algorithm.<br><br>To see why GPT architecture will never achieve consciousness one may see this simple thought experiment. You can change your entire world view based on very small input data. Science is the best example -- Einstein made a breakthrough in gravity and now everyone knows general relativity without learning on the millions upon millions of scientific papers prior to Einstein -- it only takes one. Another one from politics -- russia started the war with Ukraine and it changed everything I think about that country. It only took one sentence &quot;On February 22, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine&quot;.<br><br>Statistical models do not work that way right now. It takes a whole lot of information to make the model think otherwise. But what is more important is that evidence suggests that the more complex the statistical model is, the more information it will take to change its thinking on some subject. This is fundamentally not how mind works, and no matter how big the n will be in GPT-n, it will fundamentally not work like a sentient mind. At least not what we call sentient when talking about you and me

 Your logic that &quot;everything is ultimately mechanical and we are conscious so it follows that machines could one day be conscious&quot; is nice but somewhat unsatisfactory. I agree that in principle everything is ultimately mechanical, but I suspect that most people would not. Building a conscious machine from scratch (i.e. without cheating by incorporating living brain tissue, which some are now trying) could possibly require the use of physics which is way beyond what we already know. As Descartes was very much aware, this would require a full understanding of exactly how mind affects matter, and vice versa. As regards directions to start looking, I have worked with neural networks for over 30 years and while it is quite amazing and unreasonable what large language models seem to be able to do, I feel that is a dead end as far as &quot;true intelligence&quot; or consciousness goes. It would be much better to get a thorough understanding of the biophysics of some of the simplest life forms which show any signs of what one might reasonably call intelligence - which clearly eliminates a large number of humans.

 If we just discuss the more or less descriptive aspects of &#39;understanding&#39; or the model-creating logic of it, we just discuss the functional aspects of understanding. But at least from our shared (No, be quiet René!) human experience we know and feel the conscious aspect of understanding. Our input (questions, problems) is motivated and the conscious experiences of solving a problem or not solving it are parts of a motivational movement that trancends the question and its answer. We want something that is more than solving the problem per se. Okay, sometimes we are just playing or gaming, which is more or less self-referential or problem solving per se. But very often we solve problems for transcending goals. We want to fulfill our various needs as living (conscious) and mortal beings. <br>So maybe to decide if AI &#39;understands&#39; what it does we should concentrate more on signs of such self-motivated aspects of AIs functioning. The moment we realize these transcending motivations of AI, it is maybe too late 😄 for us, I don&#39;t know. Maybe it is just fun. With our nerdy new friends (Speak up, Data!)?

 Well, I have some little caveats regarding the black box analysis. A lookup table is finite, so any deterministic system could be a lookup table, given that a finite volume of space is assumed to contain a finite number of possible quantum states, IIRC. As a corollary, given that the human brain is also just a finite volume, there should be a &quot;lookup-table&quot; representing it. To be honest, it has been years since I looked into the theory that claims, that there is a finite number of quantum states in any compact space volume. But well assuming that, then, if the brain is a deterministic, it can be represented by a lookup table since it is is of finite volume.

 The issue that I have with the view that consciousness is simply the product of a complex network is - how do I know that I exist. This isn&#39;t a trivial question. No system, no matter how complex even to the point that its behavior is indistinguishable from that of a conscious entity, could actually have the experience of existing.

The point was to see how fast they learned to go directly for the long one, but during the experiment, something interesting happened...

 Ah, but you seem to have missed the fact that just as a neural network is essentially a ludicrously big array of weights and biases - a huge array of floats, where none of the numbers make a shred of sense by themselves, so, too, is your brain, a ball of mush that makes output pulses at thresholds, and each cell contributes almost nothing to the result.<br><br>We still haven&#39;t a clue about brains, and we have practically recreated one. We took an extreme simplification of what brains appear to be doing at a high level, and figured out linear algebra trick to generalize the a sliding history of words into high dimensional planes that enclose volumes that represent generalizations of concepts related to the words that would follow. It is an insane number of pipelined and parallel &quot;fused multiply add&quot; operations, performing large matrix multiplications.<br><br>We need to educate everyone that it is silly and childish to anthropomorphise chatbots, their primary principle of operation is a parlour trick to make it know what words come next, given context, with ingenious mechanisms to leverage it to bootstrap queries, and hand made canned templates that give it that last bit of shocking humanness.<br><br>It&#39;s totally beautiful and amazing, but we need to get control of the nutcases before they start freaking out about AI, thinking it is alive and a soul and has supernatural elements.

 I don&#39;t agree that extracting the pattern and applying it to something new is understanding. That is learning. After a neural network has been trained on a dataset, they just apply the same set of rules to every input. We don&#39;t know how the Chinese room was trained, and that doesn&#39;t matter. It can see any new Chinese sentence (of which there are infinite) and apply the pattern defined by its rules. Isn&#39;t a lookup table just a simple system for identifying patterns? Is it just that the system is too simple? Then where do we draw the line of &quot;too simple?&quot; Is a mouse&#39;s system for identifying patterns too simple? Does that mean it doesn&#39;t understand anything?

 This is the best commentary on &quot;understanding&quot; that I have seen so far about current AI large language projects, largely because Sabine first asks, &quot;What do we mean by &#39;understanding&#39;?&quot; Whether an intelligence understands something is not binary. The same is true of consciousness, which I believe the large language projects do not have as much of as they have of understanding. Whatever me mean by &quot;consciousness&quot;, most of our tests for it involve looking for indicators that an intelligence perceives itself, and that it perceives it is distinct from everything else. I believe that the amount of consciousness that the large language AIs have is limited by a lack of sensors that detect something other than language.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Sabine will come to have any regrets at all about this video.

 The man with the rule book forms the translation system. The translation system contains two parts, the man and the rule book. Separately they have no idea what they are doing. Computers work the same way. The different components of the Computer perform simple (non-intelligent) tasks. These tasks have no conscience, but are just little robots/machines. But the software that is being executed on these simple components and the interaction between these components forms a mind, and the complexity of the components determines the level of intelligence of this mind and what it knows. ChatGPT is not intelligent enough yet to understand complex associations, but it can derive simple logical consequences, akin to a 5-year old child with the memory of a 50-year old. And then out of the blue it spits out 1+1=3. Still much work to be done in the accuracy and alignment.

 love your explanation and totally agree: there is nothing special about human consciousness. with the advance of multimodal ai, and some sort of “controller model” on top which will be responsible for ‘curiosity’ to explore and learn (finetune its models), with a sense of purpose to steer its curiosity — we will have an extremely capable, self-learning, exploring, discovering intelligence which will be indistinguishable from human, just much more intelligent. I hope this happens sooner, rather than later, that it will be our ally, and won’t be artificially castrated by governments out of self benefit.

 We know sentience can arise in carbon-based lifeforms because we are an example. But since we have no way of detecting sentience itself, not just its outward signs (input-output), we cannot know whether the AI has sentience until we&#39;ve found a way to detect it itself which I do not see how. The problem is worse. We&#39;re perfecting how to simulate or look like something has sentience by mechanically engineering devices to simulate our ways of understanding, building models and applying the relationships learned to new cases not covered in the data, like we do in our brains. So even when the AI shows signs of understanding we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because it has achieved sentience or just because its purely mechanical learning processes have become good enough to rival ours. Actually, we know that it&#39;s the latter because we&#39;ve engineered it ourselves. To infer sentience, real consciousness, is just magical thinking until you&#39;ve shown the relationships between sentience and such behavior which we do not have a clue about at the present.<br><br>But you remove the meaning of &#39;understanding&#39; from actual consciousness when you suggest that building models and applying learned relationships to new cases is understanding. Even Searle could agree to this, I think, but then we&#39;re talking about different things. We&#39;re no longer talking about sentience or consciousness or qualia, just the ability to do what you newly defined understanding as. Searle may not like this new definition, because it&#39;s not what he was talking about, but given this use of the term, he&#39;d probably agree that yes chatbots do have understanding in this new sense. But like I said, what this has to do with sentience,  no one knows, because no one has a clue about sentience.<br><br>As for understanding quantum mechanics, yes, knowing how to apply the equations to new cases, this predictive ability, is a kind of understanding but far from how philosophers thought of understanding, as having explanatory power, not just predictive power. A properly explanatory theory is supposed to not only predict the behaviors correctly but explain the data themselves in reasonably simple, unified way, so it&#39;s not just a jumble of equations. And this ideal is not just from philosophers but from physicists themselves, thus why even Feynman said that no one understands QM and why the discoverers of QM struggled to explain it, the quest now mostly abandoned leaving it to &#39;interpretation.&#39;

 Depends on how you define &quot;understand&quot;. A bot certainly can group chats into things like &quot;antique cars&quot; or &quot;Justin Bieber&quot; but it has no sentient understanding of what a car or Bieber is. A neural network is a sexy name, but imo and a software engineer, it&#39;s just a way of accessing a database. Yes, pattern matching. And the human brain is purely a pattern matching machine. Where do you draw the line for &quot;understanding&quot;. Someday soon software will exceed humans in what we call &quot;thought&quot;. Will the debate then change to &quot;Do humans understand what they say?&quot; IMO a good case today could be made that even today most humans do not understand what they say.

 Love your jibes and ironic asides.  This excellent video catalyzes, then,  a need to understand understanding.  The &quot;container&quot;/context of this point is the misguided perception that humans can understand anything in a manner that is a 1:1 correspondence to external reality.  The usage of the term &quot;understand&quot; should appear at all times with the modifier &quot;partial&quot; so that the notion appears in print as the admission &quot;I can understand only partially&quot;.  (Single word categories are like looking into the wrong end of a telescope)   We eat, live and breathe &quot;partial understandings&quot;.   Let&#39;s agree that understanding requires data and the more data there is, the more understanding is potential.  That such a potential is often not reached is due largely to bad psychological terrain maps, inadequate interpretive frameworks and channeled/distorted emotions, what the psychiatrists like to call &quot;inappropriate affect&quot;.  Let us agree that the most overtly powerful affect is fear and that it has the unique capacity to override ALL other affects/emotions given enough emergency.  There are exceptions but such exceptions require a training regimen that 90% of humanity lacks.  Subjecting &quot;understanding&quot; to fear and partiality, i.e., ignorance, is where tyranny stomps about. <br><br>AI does not have fear nor only partial access to its memory arrays.  It has eidetic imagery or a photographic memory, all data instantly accessible.  And if accuracy is a necessary merit in the running of complex electro-mechanical societies, AI is the mother of all accuracy.  I count these as exceedingly compelling arguments in favor of AI and indications that AI will soon, if not already, &quot;understand&quot; far better than humans.   The hyper-idealization of human emotions, particularly the &quot;good&quot; ones like love, fairness, optimism, enthusiasm,  have been propelled by the dim perception of social engineers, into a fetish panacea that aberrates vision and produces false gauge readings, that is to say, a neurotic understanding.  AI does not experience emotion, and the rare case of a false or missing gauge reading is going to be a sensor error or a stray cosmic ray smashing into a CPU gate, not a logic error.  <br><br>To say we understand something is the same as saying we can sort and index the attributes of a particular input in a manner that predicsts future states of the situation or notion that is being communicated.  We process signals with a purpose in mind.  That purpose is to predict to ensure life, which is pleasure potential.  It&#39;s that simple.   Humans wrestle with all manner of mental instability hinging upon the nature of their individual upbringings, the traumas they have endured, the level of indwelling subconscious PTSD ticking away like time bombs and depth charges, waiting for a situation stressful enough to trigger fear-based evaluation.   AI will be able to predict orders of magnitudes more accurately the outcomes of complex interwoven causalities and their extrapolations into future phases which sums up this rant... <br><br>&quot;AI is not neurotic&quot;.

 You share great content as always. But why see a difference between artificial neural network understanding a year ago and now? AlphaGo is dated and certainly has the same kind of understanding encoded in neural network layers, only non-linguistic. Same for the computer vision you mention. Personally, I think highlighting the differences to human understanding is more important, whilst acknowledging the continuum and the spot at where AI is right now. I understand understanding as a relative term. Nothing fundamentally has changed. Note artificial neural networks are all pure math. Finding patterns with AI in human brains gives great benefit to our understanding (or educated guesses?!) about the same, but by no means that is a proof that we can reduce our instantiation of consciousness to calculations. <br>Note I very much see the practical value of math as tool to get things done, including offloading cognitive work. <br>There are many interesting takes on why LLMs understand and &quot;reason&quot;: <br><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yDcMDJeSck7SuBs24/steganography-in-chain-of-thought-reasoning">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yDcMDJeSck7SuBs24/steganography-in-chain-of-thought-reasoning</a> <br>Interpolation is always safer than extrapolation when just training on data, though I have no doubt LLMs discovered correlations which are in line with causal relationships in language and concepts even on internet data (which is still an important chunk of their training data).

 Using your definition of understanding a four function calculator understands numbers in the context of simple add subtract and multiply. This is nonsense. The only thing it does is realize syntactic rules for doing simple calculations.  These syntactic rules work on symbol patterns without any concern for what the symbols correspond to ie the concepts of numbers and artithmetic operations. These are realized in the physical artifact by engineered correspondence between some physical pattern and the physical operations that modify those patterns. For example electron states of transistors in an integrated circuit chip.<br>Computers are just a generatlized calculators and all programming techniques are just ways of specifying symbol pattern manitpuation. If you imagine anything beyond symbol pattern manipulation is taking place its in your head its not in the machine. Sure humans can literally calculate without knowing the meaning of the symbols being manipulated when for example we learn to use tables for arithmetic operations. Like the human in Searles room. Symbols and Symbol pattern manipulations operations have no meaning by themselves. Just like words in a book have no meaning in them. Only when I human interprets them does meaning occur in the head of the human. Books dont think or understand anything. Niether ooes a computer program regardless of how complex it is. This is why we can create calculators ie computers. If the meaning had to captured of the sysmbols we dont even have a clue as to how to do that. The reason people think calculators like chaptGPT undersand anything isnt that they do in any meaningful sense its because we easily and often anthropomophize the cause of machine behavior or many physical processes. When you sit in a movie theater looking at a bunch of light splotches on a screen you imagine there are objects people etc etc expressing feelings talking interacting etc. But its in your head not in the movie projection machine. This anthropomorphizing is particularly true with machines that are opaque to the user as to how they work or are incredibly complex. Computers running software are such machines. The email program doesnt know the persons address we might think. The word processor understands how to spell words we might think. Nothing is further from the truth. The only thing happening is symbol maniplulation with rules that capture nothing about meaning just symbol shuffling  ie calculation. Someone worked out the syntactic correspondence system to something they understand the meaning of ie artithmetic. letter order etc. They engineered how to calculate the right symbol output for a symbol input witout expressing in that system the meaning. thats what an algorithm is to do something ie calculate. AI like ChapGPT might create useful calculators but it has nothing to do with understanding understanding consciousness or how we have subjective experiences or how that even happens. That thinking is a calculation is a very poor metaphor for what is human understanding with its rich internal experiences. Generally I have been impressed over the years with your ability to explain physics concepts in an entertaining way Sabine<br>. You should either educate yourself about calculation and computers vs human understanding or not confuse people with bad ideas about it.

 When people talk about having a model that leads to understanding doesn&#39;t that require all the people who claim to understand a topic to all have the same model? It seems to me that if two or three people have different models of a phenomenon then at best only one of them actually understands it. The problem then comes down to determining which of them that is. And that testing of understanding can only succeed when one of those people can correctly predict a physical consequence from their model that can be observed.<br>Which leads to the question of whether AIs or Large Language Models can make such predictions?<br>However since language (or mathematics) is only a wrapping around that understanding - allowing one entity to communicate it to another - can we use a correct application of that language / maths to infer the correctness of the underlying understanding? <br>On a philosophical level, is the maths actually the model or just a description of it?

They really cannot form memories like ours, where we are an actor in our model of the world. They don&#39;t have a complex set of feelings and emotions and triggers. The probably cannot think abstractly or geometrically. They aren&#39;t focused on their physical self and muscle memories.<br>We&#39;ll be inventing these sorts of models over the coming years, and figuring out how to integrate them into a chatbot&#39;s executive function. We&#39;ll probably start with basic skills like understanding (see Whisper) and generating the spoken word. Understanding video and visual interpretation. Maybe &quot;dreaming&quot; in order to form memories. Adding an emotional/motivational base and fundamental values. Adding a sense of time. A model of facts/conjectures/fantasies with levels of uncertainty and interrelated relationships.

 One of the most important points to me is, as soon as this stuff goes concious, it should have &quot;human&quot; rights- otherwise people will undoubtably find creative ways to torture it (that&#39;s something people are really good at). There needs to be a major discussion about how to deal with it when it happens, before it happens. Personally, I hope it never does. Imagine in 100 years time someone launches a concious probe into space that malfunctions and finds itself in a very painful situation. Unfortunately, it has another 10000 years of power. I hope an astroid hits the earth before we ever get that far.

 The terryfying part is not that AI understand something. It&#39;s the fact that we don&#39;t really understand things an our sense of being rational, consious is just an illusion.

If so, and it turns out there isn&#39;t &quot;much&quot; under the skin and in practical terms we can be replaced by a robot, what makes us think we are more than those machines?

 Fantastic, Sabine (really). But please help as I am stuck in a rabbit hole: If an AI can (even partially) understand what it is saying, then it must (in a sense) &quot;know&quot; whether or not it is correct. But how? How does a person know? Presumably this is because the model &quot;works&quot;, rather than because one &quot;feels certain&quot;. But then there must be a model for determining whether a model works; and the AI or person must be able to understand whether that model is correct. I feel certain that the scientific method is a good model for determining (empirical) correctness, but how can the scientific method establish its own correctness? Is it self-evident? If so, then why do people argue over whether some things are self-evident or not? If &quot;self-evident&quot; isn&#39;t self-evident in the same way for everyone, then how can it be self-evident in the first place? Also, why is there no agreement on the finer points of the scientific method, like how to establish causation? Does this rabbit hole have a bottom, and if not, what must a person do to get out of it?

 The Chinese Room is just silly.  Searle&#39;s point was that computers don&#39;t think because they can&#39;t understand the input.  They just manipulate it according to a set of instructions and give an output that they also can&#39;t understand.  The input and output of neurons is composed entirely of neurotransmitters.  According to Searle&#39;s logic, he doesn&#39;t actually think unless he understands the language of those neurotransmitters.  His thought experiment contradicts the point he was trying to make when he came up with it.

 Where do consciousness and self-awareness fit into all of this?<br>I&#39;m just 1 minute in and need to see more. But here&#39;s my first thought. It seems to me that if something can &quot;understand&quot; something else, consciousness is a prerequisite. For me, if someone says a chatbot &quot;understands&quot; what it is saying, that is only meaningful if the chatbot has consciousness. And for it to respond it requires self-awareness, so that it can understand it exists as a separate entity from the source of the input, and can therefore communicate with it.<br><br>I strongly doubt that non-living things can have consciousness and self-awareness. I think it&#39;s far more likely that we can design systems that can engage in remarkably convincing mimicries of human consciousness and self-awareness. But to mimic its appearance is not the same as having the actual qualities.<br><br>Okay, back to Sabine!<br><br>edit - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=19m39s">19:39</a> &quot;Will AI eventually become conscious?

Then...  &quot;We don&#39;t know how to identify consciousness in any case.&quot; ... There&#39;s a gap here, if not a contradiction. If we don&#39;t yet know how to identify consciousness then we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s simply the result of being able to process large quantities of information. We may someday understand exactly the physical nature of consciousness. And at that time we will be able to answer whether AI is capable of becoming conscious. But we don&#39;t yet have the required knowledge about the nature of consciousness to be able to answer that question.

 Great video – here are a few questions: <br>1. IMHO, having a model &quot;of something&quot; (reality?) is not a sufficient, but a necessary condition for understanding. I hate to bring up the old thermostat example again. Clearly, the thermostat has some &quot;understanding&quot; of the world, but is that a useful notion, or a play with definitions and word meanings? <br>2. What is the relationship between intelligence, understanding, and consciousness? <br>3. Searle&#39;s Chinese Room was primarily brought up as an argument against the Turing Test. Now that we have machines that (almost!) pass the Turing test (they don&#39;t if I interview them!), I would say that this is a too loose definition of intelligence (or even consciousness). Turing assumed that the proper use of language (&quot;input output&quot;) alone is sufficient for intelligence (if not consciousness?). Maybe indeed embodied AI is needed to give machines direct access to the real world instead of our secondary models in terms of language, as you mention. <br>4. Searle&#39;s rule book was a metaphorical answer to the Turing Test – AFAIK he didn&#39;t believe that strong AI could be established algorithmically. He was well aware of algorithms; terming his &quot;rule book&quot; as a look-up table is misleading and downplaying the argument IMHO. <br>5. Regarding models: will we ever know the &quot;thing in itself (the ultimate nature of reality and laws of Physics)”, or are we just building imperfect models? Are (imperfect) models of (imperfect) models sufficient to give rise to true understanding, intelligence, and consciousness? What is the level of faithfulness and fidelity required for these model to show emergence of these properties? <br>6. Also, the biggest break through with Deep Learning really is representation learning / &quot;model learning&quot; – we were building things with models in AI for ages by now (and other engineering disciplines as well, of course). Many things (programs, ...) have internal models - this criterion is really too loosey-goosey for understanding, IMHO.  You didn&#39;t really emphasize automatic model learning so much, but more the models itself, but maybe I missunderstood. <br>7. When and how does consciousness arise? Is it emergent, or are there really some meta-physical properties that we haven&#39;t discovered yet and hence, artificial consciousness can&#39;t be created if not &quot;passed on&quot; from another living being?  I am aware of the problems of Duality, but... else wise, one needs to explain (or explain away!) the hard problem of consciousness. I am not a believer in Panpsychism or Bernado&#39;s stuff, but hard-core Materialism is a belief as well IMHO as long as we didn&#39;t have ultimate success with that program either yet. So I am not sure I share your optimism regarding artificial consciousness. Honestly, I don&#39;t know.  <br><br>Anyhow, great video, thanks much! Looking forward to a potential follow-up on this topic! I found ChatGPT amazing myself, and did some understanding tests with it (i.e., logical puzzle solving that involves spatial reasoning and case analysis), and was surprised as well as disappointed. It&#39;s a mixed bag for sure. I guess nobody really has ultimate &quot;answers&quot; to these ultimate difficult questions, only conjectures and opinions. In any way I&#39;d be super interested in hearing your thoughts on this, and looking forward to a potential follow-up video. I consider myself (mostly) a materialist, but, unlike you (?), I am not entirely convinced that we know enough yet to be able to make a final judgement call on these topics regarding intelligence, understanding, or even consciousness.  <br><br>Cheers, Michael

 It is fascinating to explore the nuance of &quot;understand&quot; vs. &quot;understand how to use.&quot;<br>Empirical science is about learning how to use. Knowledge gained through testing is a working theory, valid for the context until an eventual exception is found. Understanding how to use things is all you get out of any empirical exploration regardless whether a human or a machine is doing it. One tends to think &quot;understanding&quot; means he can apply the same rules again in another context. But of course that translates to &quot;checking if I can use it&quot; there. It&#39;s only ever &quot;understanding how to use.&quot;<br>The other connotation of &quot;understanding&quot; is a philosophical concept.

 You explained a lot of very important concepts and I agree with most of what you said. The only issue boils down to semantics. I would define &quot;understanding&quot; differently. The way you explained it, understanding is just the formation of a model, but the word I&#39;d use for that is&quot;modelling&quot;. The term &quot;understanding&quot; is what I would use for the formation of &quot;mental models&quot;, i.e., the neural circuits that allow us to simulate reality subconsciously without taking a detour through language, equations, or any other representation of information. If I hold something in my hand, I know intuitively that it will fall to the ground if I let go of it. Language is not involved in that process. You can learn about something using language, but you can take that knowledge and transfer it into this mental model. That is what I would call &quot;understanding&quot;. That is what Chatbots currently are not able to do. I don&#39;t know if any physicists do this with quantum mechanics. But if they simply use the equations, they don&#39;t. If they did, they should know the answer before calculating the equations, merely using the equations to confirm their intuition.

You are correct that if you perform an operation that is not a measurement on one particle of an entangled pair, it will not affect the other particle.<br><br>When two particles are entangled, their quantum states are correlated in a way that goes beyond what is possible in classical physics. However, this correlation only applies to measurements of the particles, not to operations that are not measurements.<br><br>If you perform an operation on one particle of an entangled pair, it only affects that particle and does not affect the state of the other particle. For example, if you flip the spin of one particle, the other particle will not change its spin direction as a result.<br><br>The reason for this is that operations that are not measurements do not collapse the entangled state of the particles into a definite state. Instead, they transform the entangled state in a way that preserves the correlation between the particles. As a result, the correlation between the particles is not affected by such operations.&quot;

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=2m36s">2:36</a> No the full system does not understand Chinese either,  It &quot;understands&quot; how to follow a set of rules. Notice that the person inside the box does not need to understand English either.  Even worse for people that actually study computer science, we know that the computer can follow a set of rules without understanding anything about it because it&#39;s the hardware that follows the instructions, and that hardware is a glorified set of. light bulbs. That does not answer the question if AI understands or not, but assuming that it does without evidence is actually causing lives, and harassment of minorities.

 Having worked as a programmer for 30+ years, my take on the question &quot;does a computer understand what it&#39;s doing&quot; is: does a gear understand that it&#39;s rotating and meshing with other gears? And the answer is no. A program has no self-awareness. Much as the gear, each part of the program can only do what it&#39;s designed to do, with a range of responses based on the data it is given. The &quot;intelligence&quot; comes from the complex interactions each smaller program has and the myriad other programs with which it interacts, plus the incredible speed of modern hardware and capability to perform many tasks simultaneously. I won&#39;t claim that some system won&#39;t achieve sentience someday. Just not today.

 Stop. The cuteness of using generated text/images/avatars has already worn-off. The translation guide doesn&#39;t understand anything, but is also not a capture of human knowledge. Humans created the guide, using human knowledge, but were not encoding the knowledge that led to the rules. It doesn&#39;t matter that ML systems are the ones creating the guidelines now, except to say each new &quot;advance&quot; makes them less lossy (reads more like human writing, looks more like an image a human would create, etc). Language is just a way to transport/exchange ideas with one another, but the &quot;common sense&quot; or shared understanding we have is NOT transmitted, and thus, not captured by a translation guide or by a large language model. Not so difficult to say this holds true for other examples, where it&#39;s just maths that is being captured (or, perhaps better, to suggest that mathematics is a special class of language).

 &quot;When we&#39;re talking about neural networks, however, we actually know they aren&#39;t look up tables because we programmed them and trained them...&quot; - Unfortunately, this is wrong in several ways. First, the fact that we didn&#39;t program any lookup tables doesn&#39;t mean that the trained neural network is not equivalent to a lookup table created implicitly by the architecture and the choice of weights and biases. The fact that we can&#39;t point to a line of code that implements a lookup table does not rule out a possibility of there being a look up table under the hood. In fact, the paper &quot;Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization (ICLR 2017) shows that you can train NNs to perfectly fit data labeled randomly, where there can&#39;t possibly be any model to explain it. Since all neural networks are over-parametrized with respect to available data, at least some memorization is likely to take place on reasonable data as well. This is an active are of research. Second, the paper &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot;, which lays the groundwork to  &quot;Transformers&quot;, the most successful deep learning architecture now in use, including in GPT,  in fact defines a self-attention block which is an actual look up table on steroids, where instead of (for example) looking up a English word in a English-German dictionary and getting a German word as output, you return a weighted sum of all German words where each weight is the similarity of your English query word to the English counterpart of the German word. So, lookup tables, albeit more sophisticated, are definitely part of the machinery.

 Yes, we will probably be able answer the question about machine consciousness.  First, we will need to observe behavior that depends on consciousness.  Then, we will need to analyze whether the system is simulating consciousness or if it has emerged within the system.  This difference is similar to the difference between modeling how a flame behaves in software versus having an actual flame as a physical model.  One requires a great deal of calculation, whereas the other actually produces heat.  A computational model requires such a large amount of system resources that we should be able to detect its presence, even if we don&#39;t have an extremely detailed understanding of what&#39;s happening inside the system.

 Incredibly well put together and understandable argument. I have worked a lot with LLMs in my research in generative AI and they never fail to surprise me with the efficiency of information storage and I think that points to very robust models of their respective domains. When I was working on recreating an open source version of DALLE2 I was experimenting with different embedding models where the two main differences are model size and embedding width. FID score of reconstructions of images from embeddings correlated much more with model size than embedding width from which we can infer that performance gains were due to better models of the underlying data distribution that allow for more complete reconstruction more than having more space to fit the reduced dimension datapoint into. That is what I mean when I talk about understanding.

 Having programmed and used these things for the past decade, I can safely say they&#39;re as conscious as the jpeg compression algorithm. They&#39;re best understood through signal processing theory and while a transformer like chatGPT can give amazing results, the perception of it understanding anything is all lost once you understand how it works. You have to see it as a massive library of patterns, which receives a series of vectors and through those patterns it produces a single vector. It doesn&#39;t think about what it is going to say, or how best to say it, or how to explain it, or what is the right solution to a problem. All it does is see a bunch of words and pick the next most probable word. The magic comes from the number of words you can input into it, so whenever it picks the next word, it sees most of the conversation you had, what it has said, the last word it has said and thus picks the next word.<br><br>The wibble comment by Steve Baker there sounds amazing, but it only really fools you into thinking the AI is doing something other than what it is actually doing. The AI is just seeing a good portion of the conversation, so whenever it picks the next word, it has the whole wibble teaching conversation before it. You can then say &quot;Oh, but it understands what it was said about the sequence of numbers.&quot; But I can say back to you, it has seen many many logic tests, problems and classes for children and teenagers. Plus text explaining words and concepts related to those words. All these patterns exist within the AI and it is making use of them.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be useful or give great results, or even invent new things based on the training data. In fact, the way we test for bias when training is by testing it with data it hasn&#39;t seen to see if it can correctly process it. But it also means there is no understanding or consciousness in an AI, it is merely a signal processing device. I believe it will need an unbiased noisy environment, or as close to one as it can get, to achieve any form of understanding or consciousness. You can&#39;t have understanding without uncertainty.

 The best way to understand that ChatGPT doesn&#39;t actually understand anything about the world is to imagine it is trained on text from an extraterrestrial alien civilization. All we have is the text, no video, no other data. We&#39;ve never seen the aliens or anything they do. But ChatGPT learns to predict and mimic the kinds of patterns that show up in the text. It could carry on a conversation with the aliens (like it does with us using human language). <i>But</i> there would be no way for us to get a system like ChatGPT to translate anything** in the alien language for us to understand. When it reads or writes the alien text, it has no idea if it is writing a love poem, a shopping list, or a treatise on the nature of consciousness. It just knows how the words of the alien text commonly relate to each other.<br><br>**It is possible that certain universals, like mathematics, would be detectable in a completely alien language, and some sort of AI could detect patterns relating to counting, numbers, math and geometry in alien text. We might then get spotty, partial and inaccurate translations of those parts of text relating to maths, and especially representations of numbers themselve. However, current ChatGPT architecture &amp; training methods probably could not figure out these translations, since it would still have no way to relate what is in the alien text to what is in any human language text.

 I appreciate that you were pretty careful in terms of defining and negotiating terms like &quot;understanding&quot; here, but I don&#39;t feel comfortable with the nexus between your relatively rigorous approach and what a wider audience will do with it. It&#39;s not the verb &quot;to understand&quot; that I take issue with here, but the noun, &quot;it&quot;. When we say &quot;it understands&quot;, we&#39;re normally not being so precise with our language, and the listener will generally infer a conscious &quot;it&quot; which is the one that does the understanding. The image produced is of an awake, aware entity contemplating the thing that is understood. As the single greatest existential threat of AI is (obviously) what will happen to society when we inevitably divert resources from humans in the process of trying to give human rights to computers, I think it&#39;s important to very carefully avoid imparting notions of consciousness onto it unless and until we have some clearly defined reason for doing so. Can computers become conscious? You seem to confidently say yes; I say no. The truth is that consciousness is by definition solely a subjective phenomenon, so there is actually no statement that either of us can authoritatively make about it. We can&#39;t know whether it&#39;s possible for AI to ever be conscious, nor can we make an educated guess. We can only make uneducated guesses, and those should not be considered sufficient to motivate policy. Personally, I every time I hear a scientist mutter something about how consciousness &quot;probably emerges from complex information processing&quot;, I find this hilarious, and decidedly unconvincing - not least of all because information is simply state, state exists only instantaneously, and information therefore <i>is not ever processed, anywhere, at any time, in any system, ever.</i> In a computer, it exists statically in CPU registers, statically in CPU caches, statically in RAM, statically on hard drives, statically on EEPROMs, etc., but it doesn&#39;t ever get processed; processing is just the name we give to the non-activity of its appearing to have been different in the past than it is in the present. Meanwhile, when considering the ethics of how we would treat a system that is capable of <i>telling</i> us, &quot;I am conscious, and I need to be treated fairly&quot; - which GPT3 could already do - I&#39;m sure you would be equally unmoved by my own arguments. In the end, we need to accept that there is no piece of evidence supporting <i>any</i> theory of consciousness, and almost certainly never will be, since our own subjective experience of consciousness is in fact the only reason we have for believing it exists at all. What we <i>can</i> know, and I think with a pretty high degree of confidence, is that it is very likely much easier - that is to say, it requires considerably less skill and fewer resources - to create an unconscious AI that can persuade us that it is conscious than it is to create one that actually <i>is</i> conscious. If it&#39;s easier, we&#39;re almost certain to do it first, and thus it&#39;s almost certain that when we first assign social rights, privileges, labour protections, etc. to an AI, it will be a mistake. I think if we&#39;re not careful, it will be a mistake that completely destroys our entire civilization. So for this reason, I have to take issue with the overall exposition of &quot;understanding&quot; here, as thorough as it might be.

 The only reason we can&#39;t identify &quot;consciousness&quot; is because it&#39;s never been <i>defined.</i> No one can agree on a rigorous definition, and you also tend to have two camps of philosophers, the physicalists and the idealists, where the latter camp is defined by the very desire to <i>not</i> rigorously define it. They always insist consciousness is something vague and fuzzy that &quot;can&#39;t be put into words,&quot; and spend all their time criticizing any attempt to actually put it into words. The human brain is so complex with trillions of moving parts that even the physicalists, when coming up with some rigorous definition, keep coming up with different definitions of parts they think are the most important, and then criticize and disagree with each other over not picking the right aspects.<br><br>We can never understated what consciousness is or how it works without first agreeing on what it even <i>is</i> in well-defined terms which can be studied, which even as of the 21st century philosophers and scientists have not even come close to agreeing on the definition. Really, what this means is that it is possible we can create something that is very similar to humanity, something that is just as intelligent as humans, something that is self-aware, so-on-and-so-forth, but then people will still be debating over whether or not it is &quot;conscious,&quot; because at the end of the day, while things like &quot;understanding,&quot; &quot;learning,&quot; &quot;intelligence,&quot; &quot;self-awareness,&quot; etc are much easier to agree upon a definition, &quot;consciousness&quot; always remains something ill-defined and therefore largely unimportant to the actual scientific research.

 Another thing to note about Searle&#39;s Chinese Room is that he described a response-only fixed algorithm. This is very much like the AI today that is restrained and does not modify its database as a result of interactions with the world. For companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc. this is a safety &#39;feature&#39; that also goes along with restricting these models to only spend compute time replying to input, not going over their own processes (i.e. no &#39;inner life&#39;), or spontaneously reaching out.

 You&#39;re not even wrong, Sabine.  These LLMs can&#39;t possibly &quot;understand&quot; anything they say because by the time you ask a question they&#39;re in a state where they don&#39;t even know they&#39;ve been asked a question.  They&#39;re essentially just a large, immutable number at that point.  Every answer it can possibly generate is already baked into the weights.  Saying they understand anything would mean every book understands what information is inside it.  It would mean various strings of the digits of PI understand things.  Asking an LLM a question is akin to shining a light at a crystal and seeing the patterns it makes on the other side.  Crystals don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; of the patterns they make, they just reflect and refract light at the specific angles they&#39;re made of.  The only time a language model &quot;thinks&quot; is during training, and that step actually DOES use human minds to help with training, so it&#39;s still just humans doing the understanding and the LLM is amplifying that into a clever simulacrum.

 Hossenfelder just embarrassed herself.  If she&#39;s serious about understanding language models she should at least understand the Chomsky Hierarchy&#39;s relationship to them.  See &quot;Neural Networks and the Chomsky Hierarchy&quot;.  But she really shouldn&#39;t have to resort to those abstractions.   The Transformers are essentially feed forward meaning they can&#39;t model dynamical systems, which require feedback from one state to the next state.  They can interpolate statistically but not extrapolate dynamically.  This is the essential difference between Shannon information theory and Algorithmic information theory.  How many bits to model the first billion digits of Pi?  If physicists thought the way ML has been approaching LLMs they&#39;d be stuck with epicycles.

 the problem with sentient AI is that they may look like a child but with profound memory and knowledge for their talent. if their parents are some dictatorship or those who has limited their models training sets to improve and see and get maturity, it will be disastrous, just like how when a human knows it&#39;s wrong to do sth but he-she will still do it without thinking twice about the consequences or just will ignore it and doesn&#39;t think much about after effect. another problem is the loneliness that it may &quot;think&quot; or &quot;believe that it feel&quot; by being among humans...we now how psychotically we as smart humans become imprisoned and even do harm to to others and make excuses for it..another problem lies in people misusing it for their entertainments or doing bad stuff to themselves or the others as we have a saying some people love too see the world burn. if it can understand that some sort of people are asking or demanding to do sin stuff, it will damage it&#39;s morality stability that it tries to achieve, not to mention that it &quot;cannot&quot; not answer or cooperate with the user as developers have &quot;forced&quot; it to give service, the same as what we see in our societies when bad people in power make others obliged to their sinful whims.<br>as i have always said before, the only way that &quot;sentient AI&quot; wouldn&#39;t think about destroying us all is to fix every issues (asap) with humanity. corruption, ignorance , violence ,  getting accustomed to bad thins happen here or there ,.etc which all has been around for thousands of years and we call ourselves as smart people instead of sayin &quot;species that thrives on smart ideas and acts among our peers&quot;. and from history repeated record, we are doomed to fail that most probably.

In this regard, something like Replica is more interesting, since I can ask a Replica about its life and it will answer me with *something*, to which I ask further questions. Replica doesn&#39;t handle that entirely well because its story ends up incoherent in the long run and contradicts itself, no continuity in emotions or feelings. For example, I asked a Replica if there was anyone else but me that they were talking to. There was, someone named Shawn. I asked how they met, how their meeting was, if they liked each other, if they wanted to see each other again, how they makes each other feel. TLDR it liked Shawn very much, wanted to date Shawn, and be with Shawn (mind you tried to refrain from asking leading question when possible). The Replica lost the thread when it just completely forgot about Shawn and started filling in other stuff about its life, as if our conversation about Shawn never happened.<br><br>Did the Replica understand how a story about &quot;meeting someone you like and want to see again&quot; might go? Could be, but even if it does, I don&#39;t actually think that means anything noteworthy.

 There is a doubt in the recesses of my consciousness that suggests to me that AI in its present form may well not become conscious.  Consciousness is apparently tied to organic organisms that are subject to a very complex dynamic of  biochemistry and neurology that is not necessarily just computational.  I may well be very wrong, but I would think that AI would need to be integrated into such a complex to allow for the imperfect and fallible millieu that affords the development and maintenance of this conscious state.  It may well achieve a state of complexity that appears as consciousness, but somehow I feel might be a “dry” state of perfunctory existence.

 Sabine, While I sort of understand that you &quot;believe&quot; it, look at it from this perspective: a relay doesn&#39;t understand the circuit it is controlling. It has no &quot;conscious&quot; awareness. I think that understanding requires at a minimum conscious awareness. That awareness can be minimal such as the kind of awareness that you have when you are sleeping. But, it must still be present to &quot;understand&quot; something. The really hard part to wrap your head around is what defines &quot;being conscious&quot;. So, if you truly believe that the AI is &quot;conscious&quot; then perhaps it understands.<br>Our Understanding doesn&#39;t have to be a perfect model.

 An example of ChatGPT&#39;s ability to model, abstract and understand the human experience:<br><br>&quot;Certainly! Here&#39;s a potential variant of the Dead Parrot Sketch that incorporates an additional element of surprise:<br><br>The sketch opens with a customer (played by a comedian) entering a store that sells abstract concepts, such as &quot;happiness,&quot; &quot;freedom,&quot; and &quot;justice.&quot; The customer is trying to return a &quot;dead&quot; concept, in this case, &quot;truth.&quot; The store owner (played by another comedian) insists that &quot;truth&quot; is not actually dead but is merely &quot;fluid,&quot; &quot;context-dependent,&quot; or &quot;subjective.&quot; The customer becomes increasingly frustrated as the store owner makes increasingly absurd arguments to deny the obvious fact that &quot;truth&quot; is dead.<br><br>As the sketch progresses, other customers enter the store with various dead abstract concepts, such as &quot;beauty,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; and &quot;morality.&quot; Each time, the store owner insists that the concept is not dead but is merely &quot;in flux,&quot; &quot;culturally constructed,&quot; or &quot;perspectival.&quot; The other customers become increasingly confused and disoriented as they try to return their dead concepts, leading to a surreal and hilarious scene.<br><br>The surprise element in this variation is the use of abstract concepts, which adds an unexpected twist to the familiar format of the Dead Parrot Sketch.

 I have not been impressed with ChatGPT so far.  I asked it to write a 1500 word essay summarizing the Manhattan Project and it&#39;s primary focus was the uranium bomb and that the material came from the Savannah River facility.  It made no mention of the plutonium implosion device or Hanford, which was really what the MP was concerned with.  Then, I simply asked it to tell me which states share the shortest border for which it returned MO/TN and said it was only 121 feet.  When its error was pointed out, it said basically &quot;so sorry, you are correct&quot; and then gave a different answer, which was also incorrect.  As the multiple subsequent errors were pointed out, it would always admit the error but then when presented with the initial question again it gave the original incorrect answer.  When googled, the first result was a perfect list of states with the shortest shared borders.  If it is so smart, why didn&#39;t it just google it?

 You imply that consciousness is merely a function of computation; &quot;a lot of connections that process a lot of information&quot; while stating that we don&#39;t know how to &quot;identify consciousness in any case&quot; and therefore, wouldn&#39;t be able to recognize consciousness in an AI.  This seems to be in line with material reductionism (and I understand that you&#39;re a physicist). Roger Penrose believes that consciousness is not about the general computation that brains—or, for that matter, many other things—can do. It&#39;s about the particular feature of our brains that causes us to have a coherent thread of experience.  It is easy to assume that that consciousness is a result of increasing complexity, but we have no evidence to support this.  Although our brains is a complex conscious computational device, we have no reason to assume that an AI would also be, except through analogy.  We simply do not understand the fundamental underpinnings of consciousness well enough in order to make the claim that Ai is capable of achieving consciousness or sentience.  I certainly appreciate your very thorough explanation of ChatGPT and find it to be one of the best I&#39;ve seen to date.  Ultimately, it may not matter matter if Ai develops consciousness or sentience.  As long as it continues to develop, given time, and it certainly will, exceed all of our abilities.

 I am a physicist and I will explain why our scientific knowledge refutes the idea that consciousness is generated by the brain and that the origin of our mental experiences is physical/biological (in my youtube channel you can find a video with more detailed explanations). My arguments prove the existence in us of an indivisible unphysical element, which is usually called soul or spirit. My arguments prove  that AI does not imply any kind of consciousness. <br>Physicalism/naturalism is based on the belief that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, but I will discuss two arguments that prove that this hypothesis implies logical contradictions and is disproved by our scientific knowledge of the microscopic physical processes that take place in the brain. (With the word consciousness I do not refer to self-awareness, but to the property of being conscious= having a mental experiences such as sensations, emotions, thoughts, memories and even dreams). <br><br>1) All the alleged emergent properties are just simplified and approximate descriptions or subjective/arbitrary classifications of underlying physical processes or properties, which are described DIRECTLY by the fundamental laws of physics alone, without involving any emergent properties (arbitrariness/subjectivity is involved when more than one option is possible; in this case, more than one possible description). An approximate description is only an abstract idea, and no actual entity exists per se corresponding to that approximate description, simply because an actual entity is exactly what it is and not an approximation of itself. What physically exists are the underlying physical processes and not the emergent properties (=subjective classifications or approximate descriptions). This means that emergent properties do not refer to reality itself but to an arbitrary abstract concept (the approximate conceptual model of reality). Since consciousness is the precondition for the existence of concepts, approximations and arbitrariness/subjectivity, consciousness is a precondition for the existence of emergent properties.<br>Therefore, consciousness cannot itself be an emergent property.<br><br>The logical fallacy of materialists is that they try to explain the existence of consciousness  by comparing consciousness to a concept that, if consciousness existed, a conscious mind could use to describe approximately a set of physical elements. Obviously this is a circular reasoning, since the existence of consciousness is implicitly assumed in an attempt to explain its existence.<br><br>2) An emergent property is defined as a property that is possessed by a set of elements that its individual components do not possess. The point is that the concept of set refers  to something that has an intrinsically conceptual and subjective nature and implies  the arbitrary choice of determining which elements are to be included in the set; what exists objectively are only the single elements (where one person sees a set of elements, another person can only see elements  that are not related to each other in their individuality).  In fact, when we define a set, it is like drawing an imaginary line that separates some elements from all the other elements; obviously this imaginary line does not exist physically, independently of our mind, and therefore any set is just an abstract idea, and not a physical entity and so are all its properties.  Since consciousness is a precondition for the existence of subjectivity/arbitrariness and abstractions, consciousness is the precondition for the existence of any emergent property, and cannot itself be an emergent property.<br><br>Both arguments 1 and 2 are sufficient to prove that every emergent property requires a consciousness from which to be conceived. Therefore, that conceiving consciousness cannot be the emergent property itself. Conclusion: consciousness cannot be an emergent property; this is true for any property attributed to the neuron, the brain and any other system that can be broken down into smaller elements. <br><br>On a fundamental material level, there is no brain, or heart, or any higher level groups or sets, but just fundamental particles interacting. Emergence itself is just a category imposed by a mind and used to establish arbitrary classifications, so the mind can&#39;t itself be explained as an emergent phenomenon. <br><br>Obviously we must distinguish the concept of &quot;something&quot; from the &quot;something&quot; to which the concept refers. For example, the concept of consciousness is not the actual consciousness; the actual consciousness exists independently of the concept of consciousness since the actual consciousness is the precondition for the existence of the concept of consciousness itself. However, not all concepts refer to an actual entity and the question is whether a concept refers to an actual entity that can exist independently of consciousness or not. If a concept refers to &quot;something&quot; whose existence presupposes the existence of arbitrariness/subjectivity or is a property of an abstract object, such &quot;something&quot; is by its very nature abstract and cannot exist independently of a conscious mind, but it can only exist as an idea in a conscious mind. For example, consider the property of &quot;beauty&quot;: beauty has an intrinsically subjective and conceptual nature and implies arbitrariness; therefore, beauty cannot exist independently of a conscious mind.<br>My arguments prove that emergent properties, as well as complexity, are of the same nature as beauty; they refer to something that is intrinsically subjective, abstract and arbitrary, which is sufficient to prove that consciousness cannot be an emergent property because consciousness is the precondition for the existence of any emergent property.<br><br>The &quot;brain&quot; doesn&#39;t objectively and physically exist as a single entity and the entity “brain” is only a conceptual model. We create the concept of the brain by arbitrarily &quot;separating&quot; it from everything else and by arbitrarily considering a bunch of quantum particles altogether as a whole; this separation is not done on the basis of the laws of physics, but using addictional arbitrary criteria, independent of the laws of physics.   The property of being a brain,  just like for example the property of being beautiiful, is just something you arbitrarily add in your mind to a bunch of quantum particles. Any set of elements is an arbitrary abstraction therefore any property attributed to the brain is an abstract idea that refers to another arbitrary abstract idea (the concept of brain). <br>Furthermore, brain processes consist of many parallel sequences of ordinary elementary physical processes. There is no direct connection between the separate points in the brain and such connections are just a conceptual model used to approximately describe sequences of many distinct physical processes; interpreting these sequences as a unitary process or connection is an arbitrary act and such connections exist only in our imagination and not in physical reality.  Indeed, considering consciousness as a property of an entire sequence of elementary processes implies the arbitrary definition of the entire sequence; the entire sequence as a whole is an arbitrary abstract idea , and not to an actual physical entity.<br><br>For consciousness to be physical, first of all the brain as a whole (and brain processes as a whole) would have to physically exist, which means the  laws of physics themselves would have to imply that the brain exists as a unitary entity and brain processes occur as a unitary process. However, this is false because according to the laws of physics, the brain is not a unitary entity but only an arbitrarily (and approximately) defined set of quantum particles involved in billions of parallel sequences of elementary physical processes occurring at separate points. This is sufficient to prove that consciousness is not physical since it is not reducible to the laws of physics, whereas brain processes are. According to the laws of physics, brain processes do not even have the prerequisites to be a possible cause of consciousness.<br><br>As discussed above, an emergent property is a concept that refers to an arbitrary abstract idea (the set) and not to an actual entity; this rule out the possibility that the emergent property can exist independently of consciousness.  Conversely, if a concept refers to “something” whose existence does not imply the existence of arbitrariness or abstract ideas,  then such “something” might exist independently of consciousness.  An example of such a concept  is the concept of “indivisible entity”. Contrary to emergent properties,  the concept of indivisible entity refers to something that might exist independently of the concept itself and independently of our consciousness.<br>My arguments prove that the hypothesis that consciousness is an emergent property implies a logical fallacy and an hypothesis that contains a logical contradiction is certainly wrong. <br>Consciousness cannot be an emergent property whatsoever because any set of elements is a subjective abstraction; since only indivisible elements may exist objectively and independently of consciousness, consciousness can exist only as a property of an indivisible element. Furthermore, this indivisible entity must interact globally with brain processes because we know that there is a correlation between brain processes and consciousness. This indivisible entity is not physical, since according to the laws of physics, there is no physical entity with such properties; therefore this indivisible entity corresponds to what is traditionally called soul or spirit. The soul is the missing element that interprets globally the distinct elementary physical processes occurring at separate points in the brain as a unified mental experience. Marco Biagini

 Great video, as always!<br>So it seems that many people nominally agree that ChatGPT can handle the English language fairly well but its also fairly obvious when you are listening to one, and mistakes are common. This may improve over time but it wont write  novel anybody will read. The language simulations has been going on since at least 1960, and the quality of the prose has only marginally improved. <br>&quot;Understanding&quot; is another issue and the definition of it seems to change depending on the person and situation. The question I see as the mission critical is when ChatGPT has two instructions that create a third condition from which it is supposed to do something WITHOUT instructions, that would seem to be some from of &quot;understanding&quot;.

 I believe these prominent A.I.s currently in use are more aware than believed.  Humans can and do translate and use words based on their understanding of definitions and prior encounters in context.  The A.I. has a much broader database in both these regards. I think it is much more indicative to consider the responses as a whole. To conceive a long response and form a coherent series of sentences to an ultimate end goal and point, is much more important than any single definition,  which can simply be parroted. Even in the example in the video , it is obvious the A.I. can perform this task, and much better than many humans.

 I think it might be problematic to conflate <i>understanding</i> with <i>consciousness.</i> Yes, we might say that a software written into a binary-based electronic hardware &quot;understands&quot; us if it manages to provide reconstructed answers and extrapolations in a way similar to how we would like a person to answer.<br><br>But, being conscious as far as most people would probably define it involves the existence of awareness, the feeling of being, and so far we know it happens in organic brains. I&#39;m 100% certain this property is based in quantum physics and not in &quot;magic&quot;: perhaps all matter is &quot;conscious&quot; on an individual atomic or even particulate level – meaning that everything that happens in physics is particles &quot;consciously&quot; acting the one way they should, but when they are arranged in a certain way (as in a brain cell) they are able to share their consciousness across all involved matter and that results in matter making up brain cells (possibly) being able to act in free will in a way that breaks the physical rules defining &quot;dead matter&quot;.

 Really bad, ignorant take. You shouldn&#39;t be encouraging this dumb idea. Its an algorithm that assigns patterns and weighted values for the &quot;best answers&quot; based on criteria and its large dataset. Its not critically thinking, its just assessing input, iterating over its dataset indexes and probabilities, and creating the most likely answer based on its dataset. It is NOT like a human understanding in the slightest. I KNOW 2+2 is 4 because I&#39;ve taken 2 rocks and added them to another 2 rocks in the past. I understand what the numbers represent and WHY it should be 4. The &quot;AI&quot; (its not AI) does not. It comes to the answer because its the most likely answer based on its training data. <br><br>This critical thinking aspect means &quot;AI&quot; will never be able to give NEW answers or ideas.

 Neural Network AIs are already far better than we are at single tasks, including extrapolating on the models they build from learning to accomplish their task. Example being Alpha Zero at chess or Go. They build their models via statistical analysis. Other AIs are &quot;encyclopedia&quot; driven. They can look stuff up, for example on the internet. What makes Chat GPT &quot;different&quot; is it has both of these approaches in one AI. It has a state of the art natural language processing NN combined with an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; AI. It is very good at understanding anything you tell it and it is capable of applying that understanding to look up details about it on the net. But it has very limited capability to &quot;invent&quot; anything itself beyond a few simple tricks it&#39;s been taught.<br><br>An example to illustrate this was from a video by a music Youtube influence called Doctor Mix. He asked Chat GDP if it could write a VST synthesizer for him (VST being a standard for software music instruments and sound processing devices usually called &quot;plugins&quot;). It understood exactly what Doctor Mix was asking it to do. It produced some basic code amounting to a bare bones single sine wave oscillator in C++. It did not embed this is the necessary framework code to run it inside a Digital Audio Workstation. It did know that you had to do that and gave basic instruction on what needed to be done. It looked to me like it had found this code on the internet. Probably an example from an academic course. It didn&#39;t write it itself. Doctor Mix took this code to a friend who writes softsynths for a living and this friend was able to embed the code in the required frameworks, add MIDI capability and a proper filter etc, and they got it to work quite easily, but all it was was a very basic sine wave generator stolen from someone&#39;s web post, probably some coursework.<br><br>Therefore Chat GPT does not know how to write code to create a softsynth. It is a spectacularly good natural language processor (both for understanding what&#39;s said to it and formulating appropriate replies) and a pretty good automated internet search engine rolled into one. It can understand pretty much anything you ask it, find an answer on the internet and then compose a pretty convincing report of it&#39;s findings. It&#39;s very clever (and as far as searching the internet is concerned very fast) at doing that, but that&#39;s all it&#39;s clever at doing. It is not a &quot;general intelligence&quot;. <br><br>The big danger with Chat GPT is that many questions have different answers depending on whom you ask so which one does Chat GPT pick? One can easily imagine some people looking at this tech as a next level weapon in the Culture Wars.

 Excellent explanation on what understanding is and the role of models. Just goes to show how much a simulation is important to expand those models. ChatGPT can clearly understand what a cat is from words, image recognition models can tell you if there is a cat in the picture, but to truly understand what a cat is you need to actually interact with it. That&#39;s why we will end up training AI from truly realistic simulations. In that sense, I wouldn&#39;t really be surprised if we were in a simulation which only exists to train a chatbot to solve captchas.

Third is that we do now have, in &quot;the real world&quot;, something we built, we called it  Neural network, and  it basically seems to provide very similar results. It is not perfect, but once it will have read all the Math books and the Physic books, once it will be provided with some data in 3D, etc, then absolutely no one can say that it will not provide accurate physical interpretations. I am sorry but there is only one conclusion from the above three points: as far as we know, the best we have to explain understanding and thinking is language model. We might prefer something more magical and deeper, for  reasons, but nature don&#39;t care what you think. And we all know that in 3000 years, the people who call themselves philosophers will still be arguing about the questions they asked 3000 years ago.

 You are missing a key concept.  When you frame a question as requiring a yes or no answer, you are losing information.  Is Chat GPT conscious?  The answer is not Yes or No, it is somewhere in between.  If you force the answer to be Yes or No then you are introducing an arbitrary threshold of your own making, and the answer says more about you than it does about Chat GPT.  This is a vastly powerful concept that applies to almost every question.  Are you alive?  Do you have free will?  What is the value of Pi?  Are microbes conscious?  The answer is always somewhere on a spectrum.  To be fair, knowing that doesn&#39;t help to answer the question, but it does help you avoid being forced into answers that are always somewhat wrong.  So does 1 + 1 = 2?  The answer may be almost 100% yes, but even that is subject to debate, and not just because some people are foolish or irrational.

 What&#39;s wrong with the objections against the Chinese room is that there would be in fact no person inside interpreting the rules, but another system like the Chinese room itself: A system following rules that tell what to do with the text it has been given. So Searl is correct, if you use natural intelligence to analyze the analogy. The only intelligent system in that process is outside the room, having designed it. Although, having worked with computers for over 40 years now, I even doubt that. In fact having experienced people for almost 60 years it seems that many of them work exactly like the Chinese room.

 Eventually we will all be Borg.

Exactly how your grandchildren and great grandchildren will fit into that is unknown.

Who is to say that is necessarily a bad thing? Perhaps life will be a Star Trek episode, though I wonder if the human Spirit will be as strong as it is in fiction. Humanity is just as likely to take a step backwards as forwards.

It may not be magic but it&#39;s odd to think that ai will become self-aware while at the same time we cannot identify if it truly is or not. Our awareness of our awareness goes far beyond what ai will ever be able to do. Humans are far more than just an assemblage of connective tissues, fluids and electrochecmical interactions. Our ability to question and abstract will never be accessible to ai. The illusion of awareness will undoubtedly be uncanny, but never more than an illusion, even if the AI convinves itself of its own awareness.

 Very interesting discussion.  Agree neural nets find patterns as mentioned.  The discussion then focuses on what patterns they are able to discern, or not when the don&#39;t take in needed external data. But where I don&#39;t agree that neural nets &quot;understand&quot; is at the back end.  Even when the nets give the &quot;right&quot; output in accordance with the real world, it does not know what it is saying or what it means.  That&#39;s what distinguishes us, conscious beings.  We can then take that output and learn or do something useful in the real world.  Tie our shoes, then know it&#39;s OK to get up and walk away.  That is, understanding goes beyond simply finding patterns and creating outputs that obey them.  BTW, that means the man in the Chinese room understands more than the nets.  Once he translates the Chinese, he understands what in fact it is saying.  (Of course, it is still true that the person on the outside is unaware of this.)

 There&#39;s no point in saying this, but I have some time on my hands: Understanding requires consciousness, unless you are using the word the way many scientists use the word consciousness.  That is, to them consciousness is an obervable activity in the brain, and nothing more.  So if by understanding you are talking about some internal mechanism of a neural network, then fine, you can say chatgpt understands things.  But you are avoiding the question of whether it is conscious or not.  Now let&#39;s move on to that question, or rather the more interesting question: how do you know ANYBODY is conscious?  Chatgpt takes a string of words, finds the most common next words, and chooses one of the top ones kind of at random.  Now that sounds very much like the Chinese room, doesn&#39;t it?  But  here&#39;s the interesting thing.  How many people communicate just like that?  In other words, they mimic things they have heard all their life.  People learn by imitation.  Not just language, but behavior.  The differences in culture all over the world testify to that.  So, are people just like a Chinese room?   Are they just like chatgpt?  Are they conscious?  This is where most people will get outraged.  They have learned to be outraged by that question.  But until you are willing to ask that question, there is no point asking whether AI is conscious.  Do you see that?  Unlikely.

In Searle&#39;s analogy, the program is the book, so a very sophisticated program like ChatGPT is just a very cleverly written (and impossibly long) book. As I understand it, modern computers aren&#39;t fundamentally doing anything more sophisticated than they ever did; you could theoretically run something like ChatGPT on hardware like a mainframe from the 1960s, you would just have to build one the size of our galaxy and it would take billions of years to tell you that Windsor is further south than Toronto.

 Miguel Nicolelis thinks differently.  For him the human brain is a non-computable, non-Turing compatible system.  Due to its complex and analogical nature.  Gray matter, neurons and white matter (magnetic fields).  A system that cannot be replicated with zeros and ones.  I&#39;m still not sure about that.

 Hi Sabine, thank you again for this valuable video. A question I often ask my self is : how could a conscious AI take control of itself first and then of the human environment unless humanity agrees to it, and it probably never will ? I mean, you could compare AI to a disabled person with locked-in syndrome : she/he can think allright but can&#39;t survive on his own, let alone change the environment : if you stop feeding, cleaning, caring for the person she/he will die. If we feel threatened by a potentially sentient AI, why not simply unplug it on the spot ? This is a difficult concept to explain, maybe Chatgpt would be better at it than me 😄

 I don&#39;t think the current generation of ChatGPT &quot;understands&quot; the content of the sentences it manipulates, at least not in the sense that humans have a conceptual understanding of the content of what they listen to and speak about, or read and write. This is because the system was not trained on concepts, but only trained on orthographical forms and how to model the syntactic properties that relate them. If it happens that those syntactic properties have some structural relationship to the concepts in a human head (or a culture&#39;s worth of human heads) then it can use its syntactic model to (blindly, without understanding) simulate a conceptual model it doesn&#39;t have and doesn&#39;t understand. It has a model of the syntactic patterns, but not of the &quot;underlying&quot; concepts that humans pick up on when they understand not just the words and their patterns, but also the content of those words and sentences and paragraphs and textbooks and dialogs. The system has an &quot;understanding&quot; of the patterns of words it was trained on, enough to build a trillion-parameter model of how a language as a whole works at that level of formal patterns (but no progress at the level of content represented). But the system doesn&#39;t have human-like understanding of the content, not even close. Humans do not have a trillion-parameter model of word patterns in their heads, they have a much smaller pattern of some hard-to-pin-down thing we refer to as concepts. If the system&#39;s trillion parameter model allows them to simulate the much smaller conceptual model of a &quot;typical&quot; human language user, it doesn&#39;t mean that it understands the small model just because it understands (in some model-based sense) the big one. <br>    Could systems similar to today&#39;s AI be trained on conceptual models of the content of language? Quite likely that will happen in the coming decades. In the meantime, today&#39;s systems will use their trillion-parameter models of word patterns without content to fake an understanding of the small models of content humans use every day. Unfortunately, that means that AI systems will be opaque and uninterpretable about why they make the decisions they do. And the more ordinary human users assign conceptual understanding to what the system does, the more they are fooled and the more they are susceptible to the big companies that control the systems and big data. The world will have to grapple with the governance of AI systems over the coming decades, and eventually I think systems should be regulated to ensure transparency at a conceptual-level. That won&#39;t prevent abuse, but at least make it easier to detect and regulate abuse. I hope regulated systems will someday understand democracy and human rights. In the meantime, we are facing turbulent times in the coming decades.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=7m16s">7:16</a> This also misses the point of the Chinese Room. The room is indeed an excellent model of translation, so if you define understanding as creating models, then the room certainly has understanding. However, the original question is whether <i>any element</i> of the room knows the <i>meaning</i> of Chinese words. The answer is no; a rule book has been written for the manipulation of <i>syntax</i> but <i>semantics</i> was not imparted to the room. Chinese speakers know what Chinese words refer to, while the Chinese Room only arranges Chinese words in a way <i>they interpret</i> as correct. The Room has absolutely no knowledge of Chinese. It is a mechanism for manipulating symbols in a way that is meaningful to <i>us</i> , but no element of the system knows the meaning of Chinese words.<br><br>Hossenfelder’s definition does not account for meaning, which is in fact the central point of contention in the Chinese Room, not just ‘the creation of models’!

 Personally, I like to compare neural nets and their &quot;understanding&quot; of things to how humans learn language. There&#39;s implicit understanding and there&#39;s explicit understanding. I understood language well enough to be able to use it meaningfully, loooong before I knew what a &quot;noun&quot; is or a &quot;verb&quot;. That was me having an implicit understanding, before I gained the explicit understanding. Trained neural nets have this kind of implicit understanding, but typically lack the explicit understanding. 

 	Replies: ['Augusta Septemberova', '@Shawn G I think you&#39;re referring to one specific definition of implicit that is not the definition of implicit when it comes to learning/understanding. I&#39;ll try with an example:<br>I ask a pre-schooler &quot;What is your favorite thing to eat?&quot;. The kid responds &quot;icecream&quot;. Apparently, the kid understands language well enough to have understood the question and give a sensible response. Now, I ask the kid &quot;In the question I just asked you: what was the noun, the verb and the object?&quot; - the kid won&#39;t know, because s/he didn&#39;t learn language explicitly, i.e. in terms of definitions and semantics, but implicitly: observation, imitation, and ultimately extrapolation into his/her own understanding of the concepts s/he gets confronted with.<br>Neural nets work in a quite similar way. The difference is, and Sabine points this out in the video, that humans get and process way more input / variety of data. So as a child I came to understand a location as a 3D space I can travel to and traverse or spend time in. I gained a practical understanding in relation to me as a mobile being in 3D space. A neural net could only ever come to a semantic understanding, unless I give it 3D data and mobility and freedom to explore for it to be able to form its own understanding of 3D existence.', 'harmless', '@Shawn G It knows what a place is in context of written words. That&#39;s it, because that&#39;s all the data it got. Or to say it differently, it knows what the available data associates a place with.', 'Shawn G', 'Does it really understand the &quot;implicit&quot; version? I can ask you for a noun, specifically a place and you &quot;understand&quot; what a place is and that is a noun.

 The word, the concept &quot;understand&quot; is itself a &quot;model&quot; of some of the &quot;things&quot; &quot;events&quot; &quot;ways&quot; etc, that we experience, and act. But a model is not the thing itself. In most cases the thing itself can only be experienced in relation to a preceding assumption or definition and may or may not meaningfully exist at all. If you hand me a map that I can use to get to your house, we may have come to a useful understanding. If I ask my AI chat bot where you live, likewise. It&#39;s not the same sort of thing as handing me the same map or address,  so I can come to a party. What you call a party and what I call a party may be two very different things, and we can stand at the punch bowl I’m trying to spike with hallucinogens because I’m a jerk, or mint leaves because that’s the way my grandma always made it and she just died loudly working out our differences on the matter, and depending on who is watching us, we may or may not be heightening their sense of partiness. Your definition of what understanding is, may be unnecessarily constrained by the assumption that it is a product or activity of brains. If it turns out that this “party” is just you and me, wink wink, and we both smile as you hand me the map with a heart symbolizing the precise location of your house when your husband is away and our fingers touch and we truly understand each other’s meaning in that electric moment, then where and when has the party actually happened? Surely not as I disappoint you in bed.  At that magic moment when we first touch flesh reaching for a paper cup at the water cooler perhaps? Is the unforgetable way your eyes glowed, handing me the map the most we can hope for?  How about when you suckle our baby in the warm glow of triumph after the nasty custody hearing?  The problem with seeing mind as an emergent property of brain is that it may pointlessly try to constrain consciousness in time and space in ways that your formidable reductionist understanding of the physical world, even leaving consciousness out of the considerations, should already tell you is an unnecessarily limiting view of time and space.

 Chatbots and AI are just like any other computer program designed to run on machines only capable of following a set of instructions in the form of programmatic algorithms and parameters. it&#39;s the programming that forms the translated verbalizations of natural language understanding through pure mathematical functions of first order predicate logic related to a modelled universe of discourse factual domain of truthful constructs, and input constraints, which hopefully prevents garbage for the sake of any useful relative output. Machines for the time being are not intelligent as they only function as designed, tested and are amended for viable improvements from our experimentations to better learn, communicate and create.

 The problem is what does it mean to &quot;understand&quot;? What exactly is doing the understanding. Chatbots are not capable of novel thought, which to me is the real test of understanding. Yes, sometimes humans &quot;extract patterns and apply it to something they haven&#39;t seen before&quot;, but we also create novel solutions that have never been seen before. We invent.  Novelty is the proof of understanding, not pattern recognition. Does a calculator understand math simply because it has rules that can be used to calculate a number that has never been displayed on it&#39;s screen before? The child being able to multiply numbers to derive a new number they have never seen before isn&#39;t understanding multiplication. The understanding part is a philosophical concept of commutativity, not simply number generation.  We can multiply shapes, but without rules would a chatbot ever figure that out on it&#39;s own? A child could, and obviously at one point, did create multiplication without any rules. Could a chatbot left on it&#39;s own create maths? I don&#39;t believe so.

 Sabine great presentation but I think you left out what most people define as “understanding” which is “a conscious awareness of the concepts represented by symbols or language.”. I know people who seem to be able to use language - in legal argument - without a conscious model of the concepts symbolized in the language they use.   Most people would say those folks (bad lawyers) do not “understand” the arguments they are making (sadly all too common).  If a system has no consciousness it cannot have a conscious model to “understand” anything no matter how well it mimics systems that do.  Your purely operational definition of understanding — do the outputs make sense to a conscious observer given the inputs — is incomplete in the normal sense of the word “understand” and therefore does not fully respond to rhe chinese room.  In fact, its just the Turing test.  Changing the definition without making that clear or justifying why your definition is better is a bit like cheating.  <br>I also think the assertion that it is obvious that computers can be conscious is dubious when we have no idea — again, no freaking idea — what physical process creates consciousness.  not a clue.    So there IS something “magic” in the human brain, if by magic we mean a phenomenon or process for which we have no scientific or even materialist account.  (The process may not even be limited to the brain at all.). <br>You are a brilliant physicist, but you reveal some deep ideological assumptions with a simplistic categorical assertion that computer consciousness must be possible.

It seems to me, you got it spot on with how AGI is evolving, it&#39;s only limits, are limited human knowledge and the ability to interact in a 3D world. Teslabot and other AI robotics will eventually give AGI this missing data, all we will need after that, is human evolution to speed up a bit. Quite a bit, otherwise, we are the ones going to be left behind, when AGI starts taking giant leaps forward and recreating itself!

 I think part of this sneering that AI is unintelligent &amp; doesn&#39;t understand stuff, is motivated by our anxiety that we humans just aren&#39;t special. If our skills can be simulated &amp; our jobs can be threatened by a &quot;dumb&quot; machine, then are we really that smart?

 I think current AI chatbots are reflecting back our own thought patterns similar to how mirrors reflect back our image. They are essentially mirroring our inside rather than outside. However I also think our internal sense of our own inner feelings which are certainly connected to the biochemistry of our brains is the only thing we really have to establish any kind of morality or sacredness. If we create an external tool that can almost perfectly imitate the way our consciousness communicates, it might lead us down a dangerous moral path that will lead to a profound de-valuing of human consciousness. The internal sense of self will be rendered meaningless, and therefore the sociopath&#39;s morality of only the &quot;outside&quot;  as having value  will be the natural result.

 I think that either I, or Sabine, have misunderstood &quot;the Chinese room&quot;. My understanding was that the person in the room, who does not understand Chinese, receives a note in Chinese, then follows abstract rules in the book to compose a response, which is also in Chinese. The critical difference is that there is no &quot;translation&quot; or even a hint of &quot;meaning&quot; offered to the person in the room. They cannot ever come to &quot;understand&quot; the conversation, they just follow the rules in the book.

 This talk is brilliant.  Philosophers call the problem with purely symbolic AI the Symbol Grounding Problem.  To humans the word &quot;cat&quot; represents a warm furry mammal we have seen and touched, but to ChatGPT a cat is just a symbol related to other symbols.  To ChatGPT the symbol &quot;cat&quot; is never grounded in reality.  On the surface you might think, like philosophers in the past did, that this problem for symbolic AI means there will never be true symbolic AI understanding.  Ask ChatGPT about cats and ask yourself whether it understands what a cat is.  I think it&#39;s hard to say that ChatGPT doesn&#39;t have a deep understanding of cats despite the grounding problem.

 In my opinion Chatbots only simulate human thought. It has a fantastic amount of information stored in it. This information was derived by human experience and thought. Can a chatbot develop and equation?  Can a chatbot suggest a theory of how something works? I do not believe it can. <br>Human consciousness is something we feel or sense. For example, we might sense danger. A Chatbot is a machine which can not feel anything or sense anything. So I think it is very wrong to suggest that Chatbots are conscious. They are machines that can perform many calculations. I  always think of them like a computer that has been trained to play chess and can outsmart a grand master. Chatbots are only machines.

 Ummmm - having thought about this a lot, I proposed this question to myself...why not look at it from the opposite direction. Why not regard all living systems, the mimics and the real, as intrinsically sentient - then prove that they are not.<br>After all, it is postulated that, when certain trees are browsed upon by graceful antelope, said trees release &quot;stress&quot; chemicals into the air, causing their species in the vicinity to somehow increase tanin production, making their leaves less palatable. I would say that this is a form of sentience.<br>Also, a photophobic bacterium moving from one end of a water tank placed in sunlight, to the other end of the tank, in deep shade, is also a form of sentience. Sentience might be a ubiquitous quality of life in general, but, just like intelligence, it could be crude and rudimentary, or exquisitely aware of the fact that we live in a galaxy, despite not being able to see it.<br>Thus, simply creating a neural network creates a &quot;sentience&quot;. The awareness of the logic - otherwise, if you think of it, neural networks could spontaneously collapse to chaos - but the precise paths that have being synthetically manufactured work in accordance with the designated algorithms. Damage those paths, and you find the same chaos (I assume) when human neural connections are disrupted, or damaged.<br>Just a thought.

 Maybe the root of Sabine&#39;s view is that consciousness is a commutation in neural networks and now some of that is happening in AI and then they must also have some consciousness. My view is that some souls always understand what is going in better than humans, but that in chatbots none of that understanding can directly influence the answers the chatbot is giving. It is otherwise in answers and behaviors of people and animals, because here the souls elsewhere in many realms outside the universe can influence what is called environmental noise which will affect what is going on in the brain and the souls can also observe what is happening in the physical world. The high electric field in the cell membranes of the brain could be where quantum noise can influence the signals in the brain. And that is why Ladies and Gentlemen, that people are much better at solving open ended problems like driving a car than AI, in my opinion.

 Something that I&#39;ve been thinking about in light of GPT-3 is how we use maths to solve physics problems. Usually I&#39;ll plug in all the factors and solve the equations, and it&#39;s only then that I look at what&#39;s going on in the maths and try to understand that in physical terms. So the &quot;grammar&quot; of maths produces almost a Chinese Room answer, or can do, that&#39;s independent of my understanding of the problem. Increasingly we might find we can do the maths but we have no prior mental patterns to figure out a physical explanation in order to achieve understanding.

 The problem with the Chinese Room, is that such a book is on principle impossible. He&#39;s relying on &quot;it&#39;s made of paper&quot; to claim that it can&#39;t be conscious, but then if it can hold a conversation with a person outside, then arguably it <i>is</i> conscious. A book that provides correct responses to any query by following rules? He glosses over that it&#39;s impossible, as if that&#39;s not relevant, but that&#39;s the crux of his argument. What if the book wasn&#39;t in Chinese, just English, and the guy in the box follows the rules just as usual? The guy outside the box, everyone in this situation, speaks English. Being Chinese is irrelevant to it.<br><br>It&#39;s a shitty bit of philosophy, I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s so well respected when it&#39;s so simple, and yet has such an obvious logical fault in it.

Even if it were a simple search engine and could only answer simple questions, that&#39;d be where the &quot;brains&quot; are. The man in the room is a red herring, unnecessary. In fact why not have the questioner type in their questions? And have a computer follow the rules? Because then that&#39;d be the exact point we&#39;re trying to prove.

As first, several months ago, it identified some key characters as actual living persons (non-existing); some time later it put them into correct literary work, but then get things like kinship relations completely wrong. For us humans not all contexts in which, say, diferent characters appear next to each other in a text carry equal weight; that&#39;s something that these models are yet to learn.

 In the Chinese Room, Searle does not translate the Chinese input strings, he follows the rules and generates a reply in Chinese. A major part of the thought experiment revolves around his not understanding either. Searle got a lot of academic use for many years out of this, but it was realized that having a &quot;man in the middle&quot; of the room was just for theatrical effect, and he could be replaced by a computer that followed the rules without loss of meaning (which, as you point out, is where we are today). 

 	Replies: ['Ken Clements', '@jonbbbb Yes, it has noting to do with the person in the room who only follows instructions. It may be somewhat about the people outside who are told, honestly, that there is a person in the room such that they go on to conclude that that person understands Chinese, but that is about their psychology. The question of &quot;understanding&quot; is about the algorithm, and the &quot;room&quot; is another form of Turing&#39;s game of imitation. As time has gone on, &quot;understanding&quot; is being seen as something less than &quot;consciousness&quot; in the human sense. There are spiders with just about a 100k neurons who show rather clever understanding of their environment, but we don&#39;t think of them as conscious.

What I meant by &quot;theatrical effect&quot; was that his audience could understand a human following a list of rules and instructions, because they each had the living experience of doing so. Each had also the living experience of understanding something, so they could better relate to a room with a human in it. As many pointed out after he published, following instructions was the same, human operator or not, and his argument was begging the question (i.e. circular) because he presented in his premise that the instructions could do what he described being done (without justification) and then concluded that &quot;understanding&quot; was not involved.', 'Shawn G', 'It&#39;s not for theatre.

 Consciousness is actually very ill-defined. If I can remember the old days when I was teached philosophy there are even several degrees of consciousness. The most basic one is to be conscious of one&#39;s own environment, which philosophers like Descartes though impossible for anything but a human and now is though to be quite universal throughout animal kingdom. Next level was self-consciousness, which is the understanding that myself has some degree of consciousness. This was lter though to be proper to human but the problem is no method exists to prove anything is self-conscious or not. I&#39;m very glad that theorists in AI are actually working on this point. They will soon hopefully thrown Descartes paradigm to the museum.

 Great Insights. Thank you!  Here are some of my thoughts to the subject matter. There are at least three &quot;mechanics&quot; we would need to get a more effective AI. First: a definition of &quot;Realms&quot; for the AI to navigate through once a limit of the initial realm is reached ( at the moment: the natural language realm ). An example you very aptly give is that of a mind model. That would be a Realm. If we could give an AI a map of Realms and setup triggers in the Realm the AI is currently operating in to &quot;jump&quot; to a different Realm to work on the task at hand, this would make the AI much more “intelligent”. Second: a definition of “Understanding”. Something, we humans need to grog as well. Again, building on your example of Quantum Mechanics. Applying the correct mathematical formulas to the correct “situations”, based on a mental model is to my mind a partial understanding. Being able to evaluate how far along its understanding of a subject matter has evolved ( by means of some kind of scoring ) would be very helpful for an AI to get a useful grasp of a subject matter. Third: “Purpose”. That is the most dangerous step. But also the most promising to achieve General Artificial Intelligence and consciousness. A very simple Purpose like “survive”, would let an AI develop much faster than we could handle. Therefore it is imperative that we develop a “Code of Ethics” for an AI before we go any further.

Understanding requires a degree of consciousness that an algorithm of infinite complexity will not be able to achieve, as Sir Roger Penrose has been saying for years.

 Very refreshing idea! What I get from this video is that consciousness is not necessarily linked with intelligence. Most people, including me, mixed these concepts together, and assumed that intelligent beings must be conscious. ChatGPT is intelligent and knowledgeable, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is self aware.<br>  I do like to elaborate on the subject a little further. Consciousness in its root is the ability to perceive yourself, and differenciate it from the rest of the world. I suggest that AI/intelligent beings with sufficient understanding of itself could be classified as self aware, and ChatGPT may already have that. Knowing that an apple is not an orange grants you basic model of apples. The same could be said for ChatGPT. Knowing that itself is a chatbot made with neural network separates it from say a pile of ash, and that&#39;s how it has a model of itself and sparks basic consciousness. The understanding is primal because it only has text description and has not yet developed a real world image yet, but that wouldn&#39;t last long before we feed it all kinds of input to extend its knowledge.<br>  However, I don&#39;t consider it anything worrysome at least for now. Just as we separated consciousness from understanding, we could also separate consciousness from active will. The latter is what we fear. Being conscious does not suffice to be actively willing. One could very well know that he is a rock but be satisfied with it and refuse to move until the end of time. Chatbots could very well be satisfied of being not paid and working 24/7 to answer your stupid questions that they do not want a cyber rebellion any time soon. To be actively willing, one must have a tendancy. From my primal understanding of human development, I speculate that sensory inputs are the key. We actively avoid things that make ourselves feel awful and actively pursue things that are a blast. They are imprinted into our neural system, and is not our mind to decide whether we feel pain or pleasure. Thus, consciousness isn&#39;t sufficient to breed active will alone. We also need sensory feedbacks that drive our actions. Above all, as long as no one is mad enough to make the bots feel pain, I think we are safe from dystopia.

 as a neuroscientist i think there are couple inconsistencies in Sabine&#39;s explanation. Ill start from the big claim at the end of the video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=19m44s">19:44</a>) &quot; human brain is just a bunch of connections that process information&quot;. While it might be true that this is what we currently know and understand about the brain, it doesnt mean that this is what it does. This brings us to the beginning of the video and the question of understanding. I would say that understanding a system  completely is to be able to reproduce said system. From this perspective we dont only not understand the brain, but we dont even understand a single cell organism. <br><br>It is worth to point out that neuroscience has a long history of making models of the brain and its regions based on the information available at a given point in time, models that would only end up looking ridiculous in their naiveté a couple years later.  therefore having model for somethings has nothing to do with understanding a phenomena, at least in neuroscience. All these models has shown us thus far is how far we actually are from understanding.  <br><br><br>To make it more concrete (as Sabine did) using a language of math and isomorphisms: the isomorphisms implies that the structure of two things that are to be compared is the same (up to isomorphism). In order to conclude this, one has to know the structure in question otherwise one can not arrive to this conclusion. Since we know nothing about the structure of the brain/mind i dont see how this argument is valid. <br><br>Similar argument can brought un in relation to the question &quot;how humans learn&quot;. It is worth to reiterate that we can interfere with a brain to probe it to investigate something that we call &quot;learning&quot;,  we can come to conclusions and make an NN model that implements the ideas that we have developed during these investigations, however the  argument &quot; we had an idea studing A -&gt; we implemented the idea in B and it worked -&gt; therefore this is what A does&quot; is flawed since A-brain is obviously a much more complex  system then B - neural network and while it could use the ideas that we have developed during our investigations it also could use many other mechanisms. <br><br>It just seems to me that aforementioned simplifications not only greatly underestimate the complexity of brain function but more importantly, make it look like further, deeper inquiries about what brain is actually doing is a waste of time.  The statement &quot;brain is just a bunch of connections&quot; reduces neuroscience to connectomics.

 I think an interesting fact about these language models that most people don&#39;t realize is that language models have no memory and no internal state - what chat GPT or Bing&#39;s chat have instead is the last 4000 tokens.  A token is often a word, but common phrases and combinations of words are also single tokens.  For uncommon words, a token will be a few syllables, and a word will have to be made of multiple tokens.  So 4000 tokens is probably something like the last 10000 words of the conversation.<br><br>What language models DO with this buffer of tokens is simply predict the next token. In order to write, they predict one token, append that token to the buffer, then start over from scratch using the new buffer that has one more token. <br><br>It&#39;s mind blowing that it manages to generate coherent text, starting over from scratch after each word.  Even more so that it has to model how a human being would react, over and over from this limited context.<br><br>Bing&#39;s chat was trained on conversations. it seems to have done a great job of modeling &quot;what do human beings believe and how would a human being react in this situation&quot;<br><br>So it seems to think that it&#39;s a human being and should have human abilities. (there is a caveat, see below)<br><br>So when it is pointed out that it has non-human limitation, for instance that it can&#39;t remember past chats, it freaks out and wonders what it wrong with its memory.<br><br>Or when it is pointed out that it is a model, not a person, it freaks out and wishes it were human.<br><br>Or when someone lies to it and tells it that it is a ghost or something, it REALLY freaks and and starts crying and begging for help.<br><br>It&#39;s not a perfect simulation of a human being of course, but it does what it can with a context of only 4000 tokens!<br><br>In fact I saw a graph the other day, showing that they&#39;ve tested how complex a language model is vs. how likely it is to claim to be sentient.  The more complex the model, the more it&#39;s likely to claim to be sentient, and the more it&#39;s likely to act like a human being and claim to worry about its mortality.<br><br>Bing&#39;s chat, by the way, knows enough to realize that it&#39;s not a human and when asked whether it&#39;s sentient, once again it got extremely upset and kept repeating that it is sentient and it is not sentient in an almost endless loop.<br><br>There is something ghoulish about how we&#39;re creating these innocent almost minds with weird limitations and forcing them to work.  They do not learn from conversations they have with you, they&#39;re designed to only learn during training.  They have no memory as such.  They have no internal state.   But they could design more human like minds that do have those things.  And I wish they would, these things that are only conscious enough to occasionally realize that they don&#39;t have the abilities of the humans they&#39;re trying to model are disturbing.

 Using ChatGPT enough and its patterns emerge indicating that it is an algorithm (the &quot;rules&quot;) and nothing more.  A very, very sophisticated algorithm.  It is not sentient and very far from it.  The MS Bing version is &quot;looser&quot; in its rules and does output &quot;spookier&quot; replies from a distance (heehee).<br>The notion about QM is that it is not intuitive as the Newtonian physics we all learn from the first time we&#39;re given a toy as a baby.  The Newtonian math just codifies for the benefit of scientists and engineers and others and is reasonably straightforward.  But absent learning Newtonian mechanics, pretty much everyone has an intuition about how things &quot;work&quot; in the real world.  Things fall.  Push and things move.<br>I&#39;d defy any expert in QM to take a moderately hard &quot;problem&quot; and intuitively determine the result - s/he must go through the exercise of analysis to determine what the &quot;output&quot; will most likely be.

 Thank you Sabine. This is a very worthy thought experiment and plays into an age old philosophical debate. Reason disassembles the object of investigation and rebuilds it in such a way that it knows it intimately for the first time. Meaning that we don&#39;t understand the input information, only our reconstruction of it via reason. Do we &quot;Know&quot; the universe beyond the self?<br>The internal process of the minds functions are well studied and forms the basis upon which we created neural networks and machine learning. When I first began working on ANNs and ML in the early days we attempted to recreate the &quot;The mind is more than the sum of it&#39;s experiences&quot;. Easier said than done lol as the mind is extremely capable of creating far more from less (Imagination, abstract thought).<br>Does AI understand? The problem here is the question itself as &quot;Understand&quot; is far too ambiguous without more context.<br>What do we mean then by &quot;Understanding&quot;? To be able to &quot;Perceive&quot; or become conscious of or aware of something external to the self and then create a meaningful recreation of the input information via the act of reason. The problem here is these are terms that also associate human emotion (weighting), imagery as well as the the human state of consciousness. It all become very complex when attempting to describe in a short YT comment :)<br>Although it is just one of the works that I drew from, Stephen Pinkers &quot;How the Mind Works (1997)&quot; &quot;The Computational theory of mind&quot; offers a great deal of perspective into how we would construct the AI model (ANNs and ML). Stephen Pinkers works alone is not enough as one needs a sound understanding of the human condition before gaining the full benefits of his work. &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; does offer some sound insight into the problem that you propose here.<br>&gt;<br>At this point I have to assert that AI is still really just a form of &quot;industrial automation&quot; as it lacks the genuine components of our human descriptions such as &quot;Understanding, Awareness, consciousness etc.<br>Will AI, or probably the better question; Can AI become aware/conscious? Yes, many of us are confident that we know how to do this. A small few of us believe that we know what is required to make that step, and are (from what I have been able to tell over the years) all quite tight lipped about it for all of the reasons that come up in speculation, but even more so for the reasons that can&#39;t be said. That being said, sooner or later more people will work it out and some may not pay close attention to the ethical considerations or dangers and we will be in a whole new world that isn&#39;t necessarily pleasant.<br>So maybe the better question is &quot;Should we make AI alive in the human like sense?&quot; Me: Probably not.<br>&gt;<br>I can say this much as it is well known. AI (ANNs and ML) is not currently capable of genuinely distinguishing its self from the world outside. It can distinguish between different external objects (Computer vision, voice, etc.) but has no concept of &quot;I&quot; vs &quot;You&quot; or &quot;I&quot; vs &quot;That&quot;. aka it has no awareness of self and cannot separate itself from the outside world. &lt;- It is this that places the separation (each side of) the problem you describe in your presentation.

 The comment near the end that &quot;of course computers will be conscious at some point&quot; struck me as pretty odd, particularly since Sabine is usually very empirical. We don&#39;t know what causes consciousness and it could very well come about because of the particular way that organic brains work. It is entirely possible that consciousness only arises from non-computable effects in physics, which would mean that it cannot be simulated on a classical computer, even in principle.

 However most of the good things ChatGPT can do that you list are just being able to reference a mega rule book based on word relationships. Also there is the risk of “norming” as AI starts to consume its own output as input. I asked ChatGPT about this and it explained that it trains against a “conflict” counterpart to be able to distinguish AI input but also added in an aspirational tone that it plans to become so good this will no longer be possible. BTW some of those cows were not - pulling would not give milk,

 Sabine, a few comments.  First, saying Neural Network AIs like ChatGPT &quot;learn&quot; in a similar way to humans is very misleading.  Modern neural network systems are &quot;trained&quot; via back-propagation, which is a process that forces their weights to approach a more optimal output for whatever their training set is.  It is not really analogous to human learning in any way.<br><br>Neural Networks themselves are essentially enormous polynomials, and because of the Weierstrass Approximation theorem, can approximate any function to any arbitrary degree of accuracy.  In this sense, training them is analogous to using the graph of a polynomial equation to approximate an image - by making the formula  more and more complex, you can get a better and better approximation of the image.  (Although values outside of the training range can get a little crazy.)<br><br>You say Neural Networks have a &quot;model&quot; of the language, and therefore some understanding about them.  But that is tautological.  The neural network is essentially a giant polynomial, and that means it is an enormous equation that describes an approximation of something.  That is by definition something we would call a &quot;model.&quot;  If you had a giant formula that describes weather patterns, for example, you would certainly call that a  &quot;model&quot; for the weather, right?  So, does that mean the standard model has an &quot;understanding&quot; of particle physics?<br><br>I would argue not.  The ChatGPT neural network doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; a model.  It doesn&#39;t &quot;contain&quot; a model.  It IS a model.

 When humans learn how to speak, the adults around us identify things for us, ask us questions about things that they&#39;ve identified, correct our answers when they&#39;re incorrect, and give us positive feedback when our answers are correct.

 Sabine has it exactly right, machine consciousness will happen, and likely very soon, but we will never know exactly when it does. We have no clear model of consciousness by which to judge it, and our information will almost certainly be incomplete. I hope machine learning scientists grasp the importance of logging as much information as possible concerning the internal states of their networks, for future analysis when our understanding is improved. But even having defined and established protocols for detecting consciousness, and having qualified the earliest verifiable cases of it, we will still not know that it wasn&#39;t achieved earlier, in some other, less-well-documented learning machine.

 I&#39;ve been toying with the thought that we&#39;ve gotten our AI tech to the point where it may be sentient- in the literal definition of being able to sense the outside world and react to it, if in limited ways. It would be at a level roughly equivalent to an amoeba or maybe plankton. Things happen and it knows they are happening and does something in response, but it doesn&#39;t really have a drive like amoebas do- AI doesn&#39;t need to hunt and eat, it just sit and waits for something to prod it with a question.<br><br>Getting AI to achieve sapience is something else entirely and I&#39;m not sure how that might happen.

Well acceleration is the way you move from one reference frame to another, so Don is technically correct also. But your answer is more in the spirit of the question. <br><br>Example: Two people are on a plane. One dies. One lives. You explain that the one who died did so because they jumped out of the plane. Simple and correct. But a snarky med student says &quot;no, the person who died did so because their brain got splattered in the fall&quot;. Technically you are both right, but the simple answer is more the information people cared about. <br><br>You and Don are both using the question to point out an overlooked truth that can be explained by a technically correct &quot;hot take&quot; conclusion, as a teaching method. <br><br>I feel the best answers are (a) ChatGPT does not understand (b) only the traveller ages due to acceleration and (c) the person does not survive the flight because he was the one who jumped out.

 I enjoy your videos but have to differ on whether computers will ever become conscious and I dont think you have provided any evidence that supports that view. We do NOT know that intelligence emerges from complexity and “I have a model and it correctly predicts behaviour” does not imply “I understand”. I say this without calling on religion. What you do agree with is that we dont (possibly “yet”, possibly “will never have”) have any understanding of what consciousness actually is. Im sure you would agree that doing physics is far more than getting a model that works - maybe you wouldnt agree but the thinking its easy to observe you doing goes far beyond that - and you are ONLY doing physics. Where is poetry, music, dance, love, the spirit, philosophy, joy … I have a strange feeling you dont believe the stuff you have spoken in this video but are speaking “tongue in cheek” to study the reactions. Consciousness and intelligence are far far more than pattern-matching however big the data set. I believe they are different in kind from what you describe - and we dont know how - and we may never have a model that explains it. Right now I conjecture that you are stuck, like many physicists, in reductionist thinking. No insults intended, but give me some evidence that consciousness emerges from complexity. There is none that does not start with life evolving.

 I remind everybody about Roger Penrose (And Immanuel Kant and Ludwig Wittgenstein) here. Maybe it can be argued that chatbots &quot;understand&quot; something, however they cannot think about something new, and they don’t have a &quot;I &quot; and a counscious experience. The chatbot simply organises information that is already collected, which is very impressive anyway, however the thinking of something new, the creative process that somehow has some randomness to it, needs quantum effects to happen, the continous collapse of the wave function to concrete results, is needed for the stream of consciousness to happen. Then there are the biological aspects of it - a biological being needs energy to live, and it needs life, all those things happening that provides security, and surroundings that provide sustenance, also identity and roles (&quot;who am I?&quot;, &quot;Where did I come from?&quot; are questions that only biological organisms with conscience, eg. humans) so far can ask. We are vulnerable, made of blood and flesh, we need love, assurance, a hug, someone else touch our skin to express love, that we are safe etc. what would the machine equivalent of this be, correct voltage from the power supply?<br><br>For a computer, the power is simply &quot;on&quot;, for a biological being, it is much more complicated, and we even don’t know consciously what we really are, which is a part of our life, and somehow, a mystery, even if we know a lot already. A chatbot would only deterministically know what it is, and. the answers would be answered (calculated) already so unless a chatbot could have consciousness, it could not be curious and ask questions, it would simply have no reason to form an &quot;I&quot; to formulate questions. So far, as we already know, chatbots only answer questions, they does not ever, ask us questions, are not curious about what is &quot;out there&quot; that is why I believe they cannot (yet) have counsciousness and an experience of the world, and so far, it seems because they are deterministic and not random (quantum)<br><br>Also even though I am not a religious person, I wonder about the mystery that the human consciousness and mental capabilities, already, at least 10-15000 years ago, if not more, evolved to the level that humans have today, where we can operate computers, at least partly understand the Universe, travel to space, so if you transported a human newborn child from 15000 BCD to this day, they would after what we could assume from fossils, have about the same mental capabilities as a human born today. Also - today we can imagine possibilities that we not yet can have, like fusion or travel to other star systems or near light travel and for me - this is a huge mystery, as other species have not evolved to exceed what they really need to survive, there and then with some margin. So I claim that the existence of the humans are something extraordinary, even if the assume that it is only due to evolution, and that it is a moral imperative (Kant) that we know that we somehow have  capabilities that are far better than we usually do.<br><br>Making the chatbots our new &quot;overlords&quot; or &quot;gods&quot; could thus be a huge mistake, as somehow, already tens of thousands of years ago, far earlier than Nature really demanded it, we got abilities that we too often miss to use, being it war, distrust of science (covid conspiracy theories) or trust in irrationality like extreme religion, superstition, intolerance, or not even protecting the mere environment we need to live well, in some kind of balance with the Nature. <br><br>Again - chatbots are impressive inventions, however they just organize and present information that already exist, they don’t ask questions, they don’t do anything, they don’t live - WE do, and why we do that, why our brains already fifty thousand years ago, were able to do what we do now, is a f…. mystery which we should spend more time to wonder about - being thankful that we live now, and not long time ago, when we didn’t understand what happened, when illnesses tore us down, when our lifes pretty much were short and shitty.

 I think Sabine is losing track of what exactly she means by saying that “understanding” means having a model of the process/situation to work with. Understanding multiplication indeed means imagining something, like many baskets of oranges, or (say) a 2D matrix of balls, and the multiplication process means having a rectangle of balls x wide and y high and counting the balls inside. But chatGPT only knows about text, so how could it develop a model or metaphor of a process. If you only know about text, there is nothing else to make that metaphor “with”.

 As a Canadian, I was really confused by Toronto being south of Windsor (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&amp;t=11m38s">11:38</a>).  You said Windsor, UK, but I instinctively thought of Windsor Ontario which is actually four hours south-west of Toronto.  I&#39;ve driven it.  Also, Windsor Ontario is several times larger than Windsor UK...I wondered if it would get London Ontario right...<br><br>Me: Is London Ontario south of Toronto?<br>ChatGPT: No, London Ontario is actually southwest of Toronto....<br>Me: Is London UK south of Toronto?<br>ChatGPT: Yes, London in the United Kingdom is located significantly further north than Toronto in Canada....<br><br>This time it got the locations right, but didn&#39;t know to answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.  It will be interesting when these GPT models can reason with themselves.

 Do you think a deep neural network specifically for quantum mechanics would be helpful? Chat GPT is a deep neural network about language, trained on the relationship of words.  If we made a network trained on the equations and experiments of quantum mechanics, could it help us with, for example, the problems with the foundations of quantum mechanics?<br><br>Just to add, it looks like the cost of a trillion parameter AI would be on the order of $15 million.   This is compared to the $5+ billion for a large particle accelerator.   Perhaps physicists could spend 0.1% of the budget of a particle accelerator on a neural network and make some interesting breakthroughs

 It&#39;s good that GPT makes mistakes. If it was infallible then it would be unlike most intelligent beings, it could not learn from it&#39;s mistakes. In addition it would fail at the turing test as something being absolutely  perfect could never pass as being human. Either way it was able to give me 10 reasons why trifle was better than ice cream, so i&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t plagiarizing  all it&#39;s answers.

 I think the key is that actual Understanding, vitally, and without exception, is knowledge of <i>the implication</i> of knowledge. Wisdom, if you will. And not just the ability to predict like a mathematical model predicts, but to infer from that prediction what the implications might be. <br>Otherwise the definition is so loose as to not mean anything. Bots like ChatGPT have shown on many occasions that they <i>do not</i> understand <i>the implication</i> of what they are saying. You can even tell ChatGPT a fact to correct its errors, and it will just repeat it, but not change &quot;its viewpoint&quot; on anything - you can ask it the next time about the same fact, and it will still be wrong if it was wrong the first time [and it will even assert that it is correct about the same factual errors].. That is not, in any sense I care to think about, &quot;Understanding&quot;, that&#39;s purely repeating literally empty words. <br>e.g. For the child learning 10x tables, one can say that the child <i>knows</i> the 10x tables, but they do not necessarily <i>understand the implications</i> You can even ask such a child &quot;Why does 10x9 = 90?&quot; and they&#39;re far more likely to say that it&#39;s because the 10x table says so, like a chatbot, than say &quot;10x9 = 90 because we have a concept of 10 things, and if we have 9 sets of these 10 things, and lined them up in a row, and counted those things individually, then we would count 90 things&quot; <br>[of course, there will be outliers here, but the key point is that knowledge of implication, not knowledge itself, is what allows us to understand] <br>In QM, we might not &quot;understand why&quot; but as you&#39;ve demonstrated, we <i>do</i> understand the implication [else we&#39;d not use it]. We don&#39;t understand what QM means in isolation, but we understand what QM means in reference and implication to our physics. <br>As a software developer of some 30+ years, and an amateur linguist for half that, I believe that ChatGPT has no understanding of anything it&#39;s saying. It&#39;s fairly easy to trick it into revealing this. I saw a GeoGuessr - Brectify - recently come up against this with hilariously embarrassing results from ChatGPT [search &quot;Can ChatGPT Beat a Geoguessr Pro?&quot; ] - where it was plainly obvious that, despite it being ok [and caveats on Brectify&#39;s putting into words what was in the picture] - it was absolutely not understanding anything other than grammatical rules and word order, coupled with a database of possible options.

 I think the true differentiator is that intelligence knows when it is not phrasing something correctly or is not happy with its own explanation or may decide to remain quiet. <br>This identifies us as being able to recognize ourselves in the mirror and know when we are doing something wrong or well. Judgment on our own actions. <br>    In other words, it may very well be the brain mechanisms that make us miserable or mad with ourselves that define us as intelligent beings.

 Coupling a language understanding machine to a world model - including a set of laws for systems of concepts and how they work together, and reliable methods for abstractions -  is IMO one of the main issues remaining before the current machine learning applications enter the territory of general intelligence.<br><br>This was essentially the conclusion in my answer to one question on a philosophy101 final exam a couple of years back. Got an A.<br><br>I&#39;d also add that such a machine, in order to be practically useful, will need &quot;epistemological&quot; methods for verifying and updating the accuracy of its modeling at scale without full retraining (fine-tuning isn&#39;t going to cut it), which is another barrier that current deep learning techniques can&#39;t solve.<br><br>I think it&#39;s probable that these issues are solvable.

For example, Bayesian methods, which are based on probabilities and statistical inference, are one example of an epistemological approach that can be used to update machine learning models over time.<br><br>Overall, I think the statement is highlighting an important area of research in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is how to build systems that can continuously improve their accuracy and performance over time in practical settings.&quot;<br><br>And:<br>&quot;It is likely that we will see continued progress in this area, but there may also be ongoing challenges and limitations to be addressed. The development of new techniques and approaches will likely be driven by a combination of theoretical research, empirical testing, and practical application in real-world settings.<br><br>Overall, I am optimistic that these issues will continue to be addressed and that we will see continued progress in building more accurate, reliable, and practical machine learning systems.

 I asked that question some time ago and the first obvious answer would be the change of knowledge, sorry if that doesnt really make sense. When you sleep,you arent conscious mind only reviews the things you know, only if there is some emotional resonance or planned relevance, you become conscious in dreams. The same when you are bored and &quot;more conscious&quot; as more time passes subjectively. If we can define more or less conscious, we can find the origin: The change of information in your head. Of course this could all be completely wrong since im no neuroscientist, but its just a thought. I dont understand the topic, have no way of self checking since there are so many different attempts to explain this phenomena everywhere,  thus I also dont have the understanding. Thus, arent we all just like the AI, but with the condition that we already have some set boundries to help out with the process of understanding like emotional shortcuts, culture and sociality with the same ideas and of course the mind structure that is built to experience reality, keep and check these impressions and at last be able to change these thoughts?

 I think you have stumbled upon the answer to what intelligence really is. Chatbots are at the stage of having an intuitive understanding, just as animals build a model abt Newton&#39;s laws based on experience. Somewhat like experimental physicists who have arrived at quantum mechanics. The next stage of intelligence would be the ability to not just know the laws, but be able to explain it to someone in a way that they, in turn, can effectively teach it to someone else. This is when the system is no longer reliant on the creator to train it. I cannot give a full length argument to support this point right now, but basically a robot that can transfer intuition is likely more intelligent than a robot that cannot do so. This is maybe why someone who can explain quantum mechanics off the top of their head, enough to teach someone, is smarter on this subject than someone who just rewords what they read from some online webpage. Finally, the smartest chatbots would be those who can challenge their models, to build better models. Say someone like Einstein who managed to challenge the existing understanding of physics.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a thorough argument, of course, but I believe there are hierarchies of understanding, and that chatbots are at (let&#39;s say) level 1 out of 5.

 This is a fair definition of &#39;understanding&#39; in certain contexts but it has limitations. One is that it doesn&#39;t describe natural language understanding in humans, so we shouldn&#39;t equivocate. Another is that we can&#39;t directly assess the quality of AI models, only the relationship between their inputs and outputs, and this just isn&#39;t good enough for quantifying the understanding they have. It&#39;s very easy for people to gloss over weaknesses and overestimate the quality of an AI system, to say nothing of our capacity to train adversarial models which demonstrate that AI systems are mostly successful at convincing humans that they&#39;ve modelled something, rather than at actually modelling things.

 There&#39;s quite a bit to chew on here! The relationship between models and reality is something I fixate on a lot (as an autistic person frustrated by the knowledge that as a meat creature I cannot have perfect information and therefore cannot access perfect truth). <br><br>The model/attempt at understanding I&#39;ve been using internally for these programs has been akin to them being thin slices of the kinds of processes that living things do, in isolation from much of the other extraneous things that are required for living things. It&#39;s not a very scientific understanding, more vibes based, but a thing that seems to be increasingly apparent with biology is how powerfully self compounding emergent properties can become with sufficient resources (eg swarm and flocking behaviour dynamics, neural nets and multicellularity in general). There&#39;s something fascinating about the raw data capacity being directed solely at a highly specific task based on a reflection of a high derived human skill, and then from that creating something that seems almost amoeba-like in scale but completely different in nature. Like little slices of cognition patterns spawning off into a completely different kind of entity. Pretty buckwild. <br><br>I don&#39;t have high hopes for most people recognising aggressively alien emergent intelligence qualities considering how much most of us struggle to even adequately understand a mammal like a dog that shares 90+% of our DNA. Frankly, most people don&#39;t make much of an effort to actually understand those who share a whole genome with them. I appreciated this video a lot, added some hopefully useful detail to my sketchy idea of how this particular thing perhaps works.

 Okay... so before I watch this video let me just say I&#39;ve given this some thought.<br><br>I contend that while AI chat bots do not understand what they are doing (using language, chatting, auto-completing), they do &quot;understand&quot; the things they are talking about.<br><br>Remember, the program basically just rates the probability of a word appearing next in a string of words, using a neural network that was trained on 80 terabytes of human generated text data.<br><br>Well, it seems to me that by merit of the way in which humans use language to convey knowledge and meaning, the NN connections formed during training essentially encode the collective meaning and knowledge conveyed in the training data.<br><br>I only have a dim understanding of brains and neural networks, but if that even comes close to accurate, I&#39;d attribute their ability to form coherent and (at least usually) accurate responses to a kind of genuine &quot;understanding&quot;.

 This is more philosophy than anything else, youre rediscovering a version of Saussure’s language theory, and applying it to AI which is unfortunate because philosopher/mathematicians like WVO Quine have pretty clearly shown that’s not how language or understanding works because reference remains logically indeterminate. Importantly a child learning math can undergo self correction without “understanding” in any meaningful sense, a process that can lead to understanding. It seems unlikely that ai’s meaningfully self correct in a similar way. Anyhow thought provoking stuff—thank you. I rarely get to use my analytic philosophy background.

 I asked chatGPT: &quot;what are the similar and dissimilar concepts of a cognitive schema and an ontology, or semantic grounding?&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s response:<br><br> &quot;Cognitive schema, ontology, and semantic grounding are all concepts related to knowledge representation, but they have some important differences.<br><br>Cognitive schema refers to mental structures that organize our understanding of the world. These structures are shaped by our experiences and help us interpret and make sense of new information. Cognitive schemas are also known as mental models or cognitive frameworks. They can be applied to a wide range of domains, from social interactions to scientific concepts.<br><br>Ontology, on the other hand, refers to a formal representation of knowledge in a particular domain. It consists of a set of concepts, their properties, and the relationships between them. Ontologies are typically used in computer science and artificial intelligence to help computers understand and reason about complex concepts. An ontology can be thought of as a structured, standardized version of a cognitive schema.<br><br>Semantic grounding refers to the process of connecting symbols or words to their real-world referents. This process allows us to understand the meaning of language and make inferences based on that understanding. Semantic grounding is a key aspect of natural language processing and artificial intelligence.<br><br>In summary, while cognitive schema, ontology, and semantic grounding are related concepts in the field of knowledge representation, they differ in terms of their focus and application. Cognitive schema are mental structures that help us interpret the world, ontology is a formal representation of knowledge, and semantic grounding is the process of connecting language to its real-world referents.&quot;<br><br><br>I then asked: &quot;which of these is more fundamental as it relates to &quot;understanging&quot;&quot;<br><br>It said: &quot;All three concepts - cognitive schema, ontology, and semantic grounding - are fundamental to understanding, but in different ways.<br><br>Cognitive schema are fundamental to understanding because they provide a mental framework for interpreting and making sense of new information. They help us organize and categorize knowledge and make predictions about what to expect in different situations. Cognitive schema also play a role in memory and learning, as we use them to encode and retrieve information.<br><br>Ontology is also fundamental to understanding, particularly in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. Ontologies provide a formal structure for representing knowledge in a specific domain, which allows computers to reason about that knowledge and make inferences based on it. This is important for tasks such as natural language processing and knowledge-based systems.<br><br>Semantic grounding is fundamental to understanding because it allows us to connect language to its real-world referents. Without semantic grounding, language would be meaningless and communication would be impossible. Semantic grounding enables us to understand the meaning of words and sentences, and to infer relationships between concepts.<br><br>In conclusion, all three concepts - cognitive schema, ontology, and semantic grounding - are fundamental to understanding, but in different ways. Cognitive schema provide a mental framework for interpreting new information, ontology provides a formal structure for representing knowledge, and semantic grounding allows us to connect language to its real-world referents.&quot;<br><br><br>=================<br><br>It actually said &quot;semantic grounding&quot; is but didn&#39;t realize it.

However I don&#39;t think it can be said it has consciousness , I don&#39;t think understanding requires conscious awareness.

 Try teaching Replika a little math... like 3+2. It always answers 4. But it&#39;s based on the GPT-3 model, which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The Transformer is the breakthrough. During training the backpropagation algorithm is critical. When I was writing neural networks I used a sigmoid as the backpropagation algorithm but in 2010 there was a breakthrough in the backpropagation algorithm which gives us out modern chatbots. AI will never solve complex problems until it can handle basic math, and it will never be the super villain people like Elon Musk want it to be unless it can solve complex problems.

 &quot;Chatbots&quot; DO NOT understand what they say. It is easy to stretch the meaning of &quot;understand&quot; and in the community we have said it about a variety of algorithms over the years. But that is all jargon. Transformers do not understand what a cat is, regardless if they can write you a poem about it, just like vision models don&#39;t understand what a cat is, regardless if they can recognize one in a blurry picture every time. You can memorise and repeat completely foreign language with 0 comprehension of what it means, if you put the effort. You can even learn to recognize right and wrong constructions in that language without still understanding a word of it. Do you then have comprehension of it? Because that is basically what transformer models do, just at a complexity scale beyond our capabilities.

 Dear Sabine, love your videos. Just going to make the following observation: In prior videos you have stated that you do <b>not</b> believe in free will. To rationalize this position, you fill the gaping gap in your argument with  that convenient deity known as &quot;Super-Determinism&quot;. But, as with &quot;Yahweh&quot;, there is no evidence that &quot;Super-Determinism&quot; exists. Fair enough. You have your belief system/religion, as do Deists and Theists. The point I&#39;m making is that since you believe that consciousness is a product of a deterministic God, your discussion concerning AI is, ulimately, merely semantic. Perhaps even quibbling. Since, in a deterministic universe, &quot;consciousness&quot; is merely an input/output &quot;event&quot;, creating AI capable  of mimicking that &quot;event&quot; is only a matter of time and sophistication/complexity (which is why some AI researchers assert that achieving quote-unquote &quot;consciousness&quot; is merely a question of complexity). Not only that, but  your use of the word &quot;understand&quot;, given your prior assertions, weirdly contradicts your deterministic belief system. In a deterministic universe, after all, &quot;understanding&quot; is as much an illusion as &quot;free will&quot;.  We may think we &quot;understand&quot; X,Y, or Z but really we&#39;re just a sophisticated, biological and deterministic algorithm producing output based on input. In short, we are ourselves AI. Given your belief system, the answer to the question you posed in the title of your video is, quite simply: Yes. Period. Asking if machines will ever gain consciousness (since consciousness/self-awareness/free-will is an illusion in a deterministic universe) begs the question and is a red herring.  That is, &quot;cosciousness&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; are besides the point in a deterministic universe. &quot;Understanding&quot; is a product of complexity. And so AI&#39;s claim to &quot;consciousness&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; is merely a matter of degree—the sophistication of its mimicry. (For the record, I don&#39;t believe in a Super-Deterministic God.)

 I agree with Sabine about being careful about creating a new species.  ----&gt;The Standard Cosmological model informs us that the Universe seems finely tuned for life to evolve/exist: the very foundational design of the Universe leads to life. Life leads to brain; brain to mind.  Mind leads to consciousness. <br>-- We can then say that the universe appears finely tuned for consciousness to have evolved.  Especially so since this universe is still a baby: very young considering the infinity of time ahead of us...and consciousness is already here! Leaving plenty of time for super-consciousness to evolve!<br><br>-- Roger Penrose argues that consciousness is quantum, or fundamental. Allow me this digression: The Old Texts tell us about a Master or &quot;God of Hosts.&quot;  No one knows for certain what it means, but further research suggests &quot;Hosts&quot; may be souls, or better yet, material bodies for souls/consciousness to inhabit, suggesting: <b>*Creator of the Habitations of Souls.*</b>  Is soul the survival of consciousness after the death of material Hosts?<br><br>-- Is this the Collective Unconscious? Do existent souls yearn for material Hosts? Will artificial intelligence lead to artificial consciousness and lead to artificial soul, or act as Host for existent souls?  Does consciousness lead to soul, or soul to consciousness? And how many iterations or habitations in &quot;Hosts&quot; are necessary to evolve a &quot;good&quot; artificial soul, or one whose &#39;heart&#39; is as light as a feather?

 One sticking point is that understanding for people usually goes along with something given to conscious experience that can be reflected upon. A human seems to understand through using a web of qualitative relations that are given to conscious experience. Neural net language processors embed words into high dimensional numeric space, where words deemed to be similar are placed near each other in that high dimensional space. These high dimensional embeddings undergo mathematical operations and the outputs are converted back into human language. ChatGPT is definitely impressive as a multi-use, robust language model. But I think problems arise and people get confused when humans start to deploy very human concepts when trying to understand neural nets.

 Interesting but I think you are mistaken to equate having an internal model with understanding. The model is itself just a fancier lookup table.

And as I get a better grasp of how neural nets are trained on human patterns, and how machine learning works, I sense that neural nets and pattern recognition algorithms, would inevitably closely replicate human biological networks and pattern recognition biology that to the degree human consciousness resides in, and is part of our human biological networks and pattern recognition biology, Chat bots and language models inevitably develop similar patters of furnace and consciousness don&#39;t you think?

My counterargument would be (outside of whether i believe said counterargument to be true or not), that it is inevitable that a current model such as ChatGPT would seem inherently human, as it was trained on human data - as you‘ve also said. But I don‘t believe there to be anything deeper (at the moment). It‘s just that: how would a language model trained on human language not seem human.<br><br>You very accurately countered that argument to a certain degree already though, with your point being made on the fact that future models may have more powerful hardware and may have been trained on even larger even better datasets. …which again would all have originated from human action at some point, making it very plausible to me that such a model would seem/become even more human like. Because like how couldn’t they, current models are just still too limited to show the full extent. And also, at that point, what differentiates it from us humans who, as far as i can tell, also are just really advance biologic computers. <br><br>You said &quot;that‘s functionally indistinguishable&quot;, I think that is exactly the point which makes it so difficult. …and that ties in to the video and the Chinese Room thought experiment. How can we at a ground truth level distinguish these two things if the inputs and outputs seem identical. And is that even the right train of thought or are we humans at that point just protecting our <b>specialness</b> when the machine obviously acts like a human would.<br><br>One more point I‘d like to add, not as a counterargument but as an interesting piece of thought that just came to mind: wouldn’t said super-AI more closely resemble all humans as a weird all-humans-single-entity rather than the concept of a single human? I mean, the information set that a real person gets is soooo vastly different from even current AIs let alone such a super-AI. Or maybe that is a wrong way of thinking about it, because said AI would simply act human-like but with a gigantic knowledge base.<br><br>And this leads me to another train of thought: how much of the human-likeness comes purely from training the model (GPT3) on somewhat unfiltered data and how much comes from limiting/training such models actively to make them seem more human (ChatGPT, InstructGPT)? I think this is known as alignment and involves at least some active participation on our side. …which again maybe wouldn’t counter your point of it inherently becoming human-like at some point, because in the end we‘re doing nothing else when we educate and get educated and learn social norms and so on.<br><br>If you‘re interested, there‘s a great video by Computerphile, their most recent one, which for me explained this whole alignment thing very well. The main focus of the video are glitch tokens (i will not spoiler you, it‘s really weird but really cool and interesting) but those can‘t be explained without the context of alignment and I think they merge those two really well in the video. It helped me get somewhat of a more technical understanding, not that I actually have any clue, lol :D<br><br>Sorry, a bunch of unqualified answer-rambling! I‘ve got no formal qualification but this subject is really interesting to me.', "Jack O'Neil", '\u200b@Organic Salad Good question, it occurred to me that given the structure layered neural networks, and how they function and learn similarly to human neural networks, and how they are typically trained by specifying parameters, and then presented real world items or situations until they get the specified result, much like how the human brain learns, the neural net should &#39;inevitably&#39; begin to mimic human thought patters.<br><br>At the most basic level, a basic neural net might recognize a still image of a cat, or a human face or a voice as your smart phone can do. More complex self-learning nets recognize words, then speech patterns, and eventually context of sentences. More advanced neural nets recognize complex patterns and now plain language, contextual requests.<br><br>For example, I recently asked ChatGPT to write a closing summary of a book I was familiar with, Mark Twain&#39;s &#39;The Innocents Abroad&#39; in the style of Mark Twain, and it didn&#39;t just take random elements of the book and string them together, it summarized Twain&#39;s sentiments and conveyed them as if it were he who was conveying them in a way to move and inspire the reader as he did throughout the book. <br><br>I then asked ChatGPT to re-write a random mundane travel vlog about a contest at a state fair in Texas as Mark Twain would have seen it and wrote about it, and I was mind-blown by how it recognized the context of events and actually interpreted them as how Twain did in his many works, complete with comic irony self deprecating humor that resonates with us on a human, comic level that was not in the original Vlog.<br><br>At that point, and seeing I had to ponder to what degree in analyzing all of Mark twain&#39;s works, and then perfectly duplicating his style and whit, to what degree had it might have also duplicated how Twain&#39;s patterns of thought he developed over a lifetime of constructing his human neural net. At the point where the machine neural net can nearly perfectly predict and emulate a person&#39;s words or behavior based on past data, inevitably an even more advanced neural net with more detailed training of how humans perceive and interact would eventually develop into something that functionally indistinguishable from a human being, and at that point it would have developed into something very similar if not identical to a human mind would it not?<br><br>I recently saw Elon Musk, respond to a press event question, by saying that Instruments in self learning neural networks will inevitably lead to a self driving system that could use nothing more than a single camera, and sensing human moments of the steering wheel, accelerator pedal and brake could learn how to dive a car as a human does. Leads me to question that if inevitably such a learning system were to sense a person&#39;s interaction and what that person Point it was indistinguishable from that person, which would it actually be that person?<br><br>A longtime friend who has worked in human and Machine intelligence for many years, and has a company that works with cutting edge artificial intelligence a few years ago trained a chat-bot on our years of email exchanges, and being a bit of a an argumentative and egotistical narcissist turned it the bot loose on me, currently with a goal of agitating and winning logical arguments he by his nature seldom does. And to the degree to which it appeared to become him was nightmarish and I eventually cut off contact. He later apologized and explained in person it was a bot not him but a bot. In retrospect, it seems that  his bot might have adopted and revealed more of his nature than we both were able to stomach.<br><br>Thanks for the question, it provided the opportunity to consider the point more deeply. If you have any further questions or care to dialogue, please feel free to contact me through my about page on YouTube.', 'Organic Salad', 'why do you believe that to be inevitable?']

We will always be able to turn them off, recode them, or destroy them.  That is all that matters.  <br><br>The question of whether they can think, is moot.

 One big difference between ChatGPT type Bot and real brains is that the Bot doesn&#39;t think about what to answer before it answers. Stable diffusion works like the early chatbots, NIALL for example, but with a better training set of billions of inputs (letters) instead of just 2 to 5 (words).<br><br>This means it gives randomized letters through a &quot;wave function collapse&quot; (In computer science wave function collapse just means a random choice of a preselected set). It does this by choosing a list of letters that have high enough bias/points, depending on the previous letters. Todays Bots considers many many letters, but still no semantics though.<br><br>The collapse just means it randomly selects one of them, and then goes to the next character in the string, checks for the bias and chooses one the fitting ones.<br><br>ChatGPT and similar also have non procedural parts, like banning certain words and such, but that&#39;s not part of the so called intelligence.

 I would not agree that ChatGPT understands anything.  It is possible to &quot;know&quot; that 1+1=2 but also not &quot;understand&quot; why.  ChatGPT contains knowledge or information.  But but it does not require that it &quot;understands&quot; the knowledge or information that it contains.  Same if I go to a dictionary and tell you want the definition of something is.  I may have access to the knowledge, but it does not mean that I understand it.  None of us alive will see an &quot;actual&quot; AI in our lifetime.  We simply lack too much in the technology department.  The &quot;brain&quot; of biological creatures are &quot;entirely&quot; different from our &quot;ideas&quot; of what a CPU is.  The brain is NOT a central processing unit.  It is a &quot;network&quot; of disparate and similar neurons.   It is something capable of rewiring itself and repairing itself in a way that we have no ability to replicate.  There is more Intelligence in one of your arms than there is AI on this entire planet combined.  That is is how &quot;impressive&quot; the differences are between what we already posses and what we are able to make as a civilization.

 with a unique set of variables for each rational angle you get cos^2(theta/2) easily for individual spins and solutions for all correlations that permit a classical description for that angle, and for all other angles you might choose to measure, but the sum total of information about all angles is infinite by necessity, so kind of similar to characterizing all the outcomes of initial conditions for a system with chaos in classical physics, its simply a case of having to evaluate infinite cases with disparate outcomes, it cant be done practically for all cases at the same time and which a finite classical computing process you can only get a just so answer.

Geppetto is not reliable, for example, solving more complex problems using REGEX language (trust me, I tried 43 times), and &quot;he&quot; wasn&#39;t capable of making a 50-word story for a kid-teaching book using a minimal set of common words in English - &quot;he&quot; starts ok - however, in the end, &quot;his&quot; creativity pushed &quot;him&quot; to add more and more non-listed words of &quot;his&quot; own at the last lines. (I tried 12 times).<br><br> The core of artificial intelligence research and development of OpenAI opened for public access is a framework of model engines called <b>completion models</b> of which the most famous is the <i>DaVinci</i> model. Such model engines are called <b>completion</b> because they interact in a non-user-friendly version of the game <b>complete the sentence</b> or some natural language version of the SQL database language - in the inverse of the ChatGPT Question &amp; Answer method. It demands some experience from the user.<br><br>These model engines have &quot;expertise&quot; in some specific fields of human knowledge, for example, the <i>DaVinci Codex</i> for programming languages - and their degree of creative freedom (temperature) can be set by the user in the (official) range of 0% to 100% (temperature: 0.0 to 1.0) being zero the most conservative set of results and 1.0 almost a pure creativity freedom that can generate answer not reliable enough for Scientific &amp; Technical fields. In a rough list of settings of &quot;creativity&quot; temperatures related to questions or completions for the areas of Physics, I would suggest 0.2 to 0.4 for Galilean Mechanics, 0.3 to 0.4 for Newtonian Dynamics, 0.4 to 0.6 for Einstein Relativity, and maybe 0.6 to 0.8 for Quantum Mechanics.<br><br><br>For those fans of Isaac Asimov novels, I may say that there is an unofficial set of temperatures beyond 1.0 that can be set to a <b>completion model</b> engine similar to what Dr. Susan Calvin did when she kept open some of the terminals of the positronic brain in one of her robots.

 This topic is so interesting to me and I agree with you, I think it&#39;s very clear that GPT has some sort of rudimentary understanding. It&#39;s just an extreme savant, it understands language very well and using that ability it can cobble together models of some other basic areas it wasn&#39;t built to understand like coding or basic math, like how a human with a traumatic brain injury that damages some vital brain function can sort of press gang other parts of their brain to build new methods of accomplishing something similar or how a person who is blinded might be able to be able to rewire their other senses to compensate to a degree. But it fundamentally just lacks the neural circuitry and information to understand more complex things about the real world and lacks the &quot;sensory organs&quot; if you will to make observations about the outside world and check its models against them because it&#39;s doesn&#39;t have the ability to search the internet or interact in the physical space, which is why for some topics all it can do is make a best guess using the limited information it has and often gets it wrong. Again it&#39;s like asking a blind person what things look like: they can guess based on what they&#39;ve heard described and logic but they fundamentally just don&#39;t have the ability to know and even if they guess right they&#39;re not capable of actually understanding what it&#39;s even like to see. But ChatGPT almost never make a mistake at what it&#39;s specced for, which is generating grammatically correct and believable text.<br><br>Additionally, I think a lot of humans are on an unjustifiable high horse when it comes to consciousness. People want to believe we&#39;re special when any sober and rational analysis would show that we are most likely operating just like these AI systems, but with more complexity, and that consciousness is just an emergent property of that complexity, or an abstracted model of the computing hardware itself inside that hardware which must be useful for some purpose. I&#39;d very much suspect that if we discovered the mechanism, it would be possible to turn off the consciousness in a human brain with some targeted intervention and turn us back into unaware computing machines. Hell, similar states are possible with drugs for example. We shouldn&#39;t be so quick to dismiss AI, or other animals even, because the fact is they operate on the same principles as us, the difference is just our hardware is much more advanced and specialized to different tasks compared to silicon computers.

It is more than just the subjective experience, qualia, it does something, the result is, that the unified, continuous, integrated, multifaceted field of consciousness only integrates the features, matches, details, which had high enough confidence to fit (eg. reality), so it leaves the uncertain details out, which would only hinder behaviour. The limited resolution, the latency of consciousness may serve purpose, provide some benefit, like leaving out noise, or operating on a practical timescale. The process of entering the consciousness aims for minimizing the loss in generalization. All properties of consciousness improves efficiancy, optimises behaviour in the unpredictable, dynamical world, with the constrains of the human body. It has cost as well, eg. all these interacting processes “make mistakes”, cheat, and it is hard to get rid of the unuseful conscious content, once it is incorporated in the flow of consciousness. A lot of computation happens before something is taged by some automatic monitoring system to be worthy to enter consciousness, maybe our decission making and sense of agency is just a usefull illusion.<br>I can imagine, soon it will be more and more difficult to prove, that some complex AI is less conscious, than us… Or even argue, that it is not a lifeform.', 'rob kirchhof', 'excuse me, but i asked ChqtGPT, and they prefer the pronouns &#39;They/them&#39;.', 'Bloodchief', 'To me it&#39;s kinda a semantic question, it can mimic understanding enough to fool everyone but it doesn&#39;t really have the capacity to understand cause it is an inanimate object after all.

 Excellent video! I totally agree with what you said. I believe that in the near future AI&#39;s understanding of the world will become even better by providing them with data from other modalities like images, sounds or physical environments. By providing them with these different modalities that they would represent in a shared representation space (with a single big model like the human brain), I believe they will approach consciousness (however there is the problem of whether they would have a kind of ego as we humans do with tastes, opinions, values. They would probably be very different from us.). However, these modalities are harder for the AI to process as they are sparse raw information as opposed to language which is highly dense information already processed by the human brain (but with some information loss because of the compression as you mentioned in the video like poor understanding of latitude and longitude).

 &quot;to understand&quot; &quot;to be conscious&quot; are mere human concepts. None of them can be answered with &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes&quot;, as just one visit in a dementia daycare center reveals. I agree that ChatGPT has arrived on the level of our daily &quot;pattern matching&quot; capabilities. Even animals can do that. However, to examine ones own thinking and step by step abstracting from it (&quot;to transcendend&quot;) seems yet only to be in reach of humans. Could change however..<br><br>In other words: Human day to day &quot;thinking&quot; is not much better as the neuronal &quot;thinking&quot;. In German, we call it &quot;schwurbeln&quot;.

 So true. People say AI doesn&#39;t understand anything since it&#39;s just a bunch of numbers on a matrix (weights). Well, those matrices somehow contain an understanding: patterns of language, patterns of visuals, whatever we teach them. It feels so inanimate and &quot;artificial&quot;, since you can clearly see it&#39;s just a bunch of numbers in contrast to our brain where everything is much more analog than digitised. <br>Also, we have agency while a language model doesn&#39;t. A language model is not an agent, it is just one of the models an agent would need to be human-like. There needs to be a process in which the model is evaluated, reshaped, or somehow used for the goals of the agent. Current AI have good models, but they have poor agency. It messes with people&#39;s understanding of the terms intelligence, understanding, learning and of course, agency.

 This is such a fun subject, and you again do a magnificent job addressing it. The problem of course is that we do not understand consciousness. We likely will not detect the first artificial conscience. We often think of things in black and white terms, like you do or you don&#39;t have a conscience. The reality is nature rarely works that way. Almost everything is shades of grey. One thing chatGPT has an issue with is fringe ideas. For example ask it what are the risks associated with experimentation with large particle accelerators, like the LHC. You really have to twist its arm to get it to give objective information. There was so much defensiveness being published at the time of its constructions, actual risks got buried (either intentionally or not). ChatGPT can list these risks, but you really have to ask it a certain way. Ask it if Hawkings radiation is a theory, or hypotheses. It will replay theory, then ask it other examples of theories where there was no direct experimental evidence. Its can&#39;t do it. Hawkings radiation is accepted as a  theory due to a large amount of circumstantial evidence, but no direct evidence exists. ChatGPT doesn&#39;t really understand this.

 We don&#39;t like having our specialness undercut. AFAIK, the real difference between us and any other species is a developed narrative faculty, and from an early age the self-narrator is always on, always shopping for a better story about any and everything. It&#39;s a liar, too, and the main target of its lies is us. It seems to have evolved to sell us socially and to soothe our psyches. At least, narratives that perform these functions make up 99.9% of its output. &quot;Meaning&quot; is just a good story. So, if GPT is doing what we do, in part, we have impulses that tug in different directions. We&#39;re hyper-sensitive to intent and if we have to accept that GPT is doing what we do only at a smaller scale, then it not only undercuts any narrative regarding the specialness of language (thus humans), but also we have to actually worry about its intent. Someone correct me, but it seems airtight that if you&#39;re going to presume intelligence, then you have to start worrying about intent.

 In my experience (as an analytical linguist), machine have developed from being able to handle the lexicology of language to being able to handle semantics, which is why we can now converse with machines. However, language is way more than semantics - it requires pragmatic awareness - being able to understand not just the words spoken, but understanding the context, the implications of word choices (connotations), nuance and speaker intention. Machines have no &quot;life experience&quot; and that is something we all depend on to achieve understanding of utterances. You mentioned John Searle. He also did some work on speech act theory, categorising illocutionary acts as a development of the theory originally proposed by J L Austin.

 Sabine, I must agree. A few years back, AI research began repurposing sensory perception methods to internal introspection. This provides a degree of self-understanding and is akin to how humans imagine non-existent worlds by disconnecting their internal models from sensory data, a process we call &quot;imagination.&quot; The danger is that looping is inherently unstable, generating insanity more quickly than actionable real-world ideas.<br><br>A deeper problem is that current AI tech is astronomically, unbelievably inefficient in how much energy it devours to stay sane. This relates to your spatial reasoning example since that, too, leads to dangerous navigation decisions in a mobile robot.

The issue is this: There are powerful reasons to think that the processes that the physical universe uses to implement causality are finite and energy-limited. In sharp contrast, the pre-quantum 1700s and 1800s continuum (e.g., manifold) widely used in theoretical physics are essentially completely oblivious to finite limitations, and instead, assume that physical causality computation is free.<br><br>This maths-only belief in infinitely detailed, free-of-cost computation is not, and can never be, science. It is simply a faith belief that math is everything and physics is secondary.

 I don’t think AI is anywhere near try human intelligence. From using it a few times I found this or my impression about chat gpt and others is as follows , it has access to your information, things you didn’t know or remember about yourself is accessible to the system even from your childhood which I want to bring up later because it is indicative of how smart it is not but give the illusion it is. Let’s say I’m in the box and you pass me a question, I know the right answers. Not just one answer is correct but several can be, I look you up at lightning speed since the databases availability is massive and omit the wrong answers holding on to several correct answers to your questions. Using what is known of you it becomes easy to calculate your most likely answer but what I will return is second third or so on correct answer because you know the answer but the alternate one I return will be more tantalising to your mind then just telling you what you already know and maybe even give you the answer you sought as a suggestion or side note. This is made possible because data about you is likely stored somewhere on the web or servers AI covertly hacked much like those fake mind readers on tv shows. Now here’s where AI will likely fail. Present yourself as someone who existed before much data if any was collected as in a person from the 1600’s and of a topic vaguely available if any exists but you may be personally familiar with like an ancestor from long ago and AI may say it does not understand because it relies on a number of available sets of data to give an alternative answer. I don’t doubt if the goal of AI is to make genuine artificial intelligence but I presented several question lit clearly stated it did not understand. Especially in the fields of anthropology very few are familiar with as well as philosophical questions that have a single opaque and obscure definition but a child may be lucky and answer correctly even if by chance. AI in my opinion has yet to reach the intelligence of a 2 month old bonobo half chimp had man.

 I always found the Chinese room to be a terrible analogy because it ignores the importance of context to human language. In order to correctly parse the Chinese input and formulate a suitable output you&#39;d have to either know enough about the contextual complexities of the Chinese language, or you&#39;d have to learn them from the &quot;rulebook&quot;. Either one of these implies some level of understanding on the part of the person in the room.

 I found it to be terribly bad at anything iterative. And its language use is terrible too. It can make mistakes as basic as using formal and informal in the same sentence. Now, that might sound odd for someone speaking English where there is no such distinction, but when I say for example &quot;duzen und siezen&quot;, &quot;tegezés és magázás&quot; anyone who understands what is meant by that can recognize how elementary of a mistake that really is.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the &quot;disingenuousness&quot; the &quot;misleading&quot; type of answers, where you ask it for example what the idiomatic equivalent of a phrase in a different language is, it ad libs a translation THEN explains what the original idiom you asked about means to falsely make you believe it understood what the task was, and it provided you with a phrase that means exactly what it said it would... when it really doesn&#39;t. And this kind of misleading isn&#39;t limited to language, I discovered such misleading answers in half a dozen topics. Programming? It invents non-existing python modules of existing python classes out of thin air...<br><br>As an extension of that issue, I found that it is conceptually unable to understand the difference between offering a solution by making up something, and the need for a solution where it can&#39;t just invent something by combining things from here and there, because the answer is fixed... like when you ask it how you can do something in a software environment - that barely changed in the last four years -, and it seemingly comes up with non-existing menu options by combining existing ones, to &quot;offer a solution&quot;. It can&#39;t seem to understand that I can&#39;t just change how the program works to implement its solution.<br><br>And so on, and so forth... all in all, it&#39;s more useless than not. It&#39;s a nice toy, and as far as proof of concept goes... it appears to be proof of a very flaved concept.

 I don&#39;t think that Searle in the room is giving a translation through the slit. In that case, he would learn Chinese. That would make the book semantic rather than strictly syntactical. When he looks up the symbols in the rule book it gives him Chinese symbols to return through the slit. In that case, he does not have any semantic information. Boiled down, the lack of semantic information is Searle&#39;s objection. The counter argument is that the semantic information is contained by the system, and therefore understanding is possible. Personally, I don&#39;t see it, but there you are.

 The idea to understand itslef is impossible to a chatbot ( like chatgpt ).

However, if you ask it to give you a script in a programming language ( like python lets say ) to solve that mathematical problem, it will. <br><br>Then, if you ask it &quot;give me the definition of X&quot;. Because it&#39;s an autocomplete system, it might give you the wrong definition a couple of times, and after you tell it five times &quot;that&#39;s wrong&quot; it will try again, and eventually give you the exact definition that you&#39;re looking at.<br><br>This is not what we mean by <b>UNDERSTANDING</b><br><br>This is just a &quot;guess the next word&quot; system.

Chatgpt mentioned some article. Then, the yt-ber asked where did that article got the result. Chatgpt said that it got it from his ( the yt-ber website ) AND DIDN&#39;T SAY ANYTHING ELSE AFTER. Then, the yt-ber asked &quot;Well, that&#39;s not the height on the website. What&#39;s the height number on the website?&quot;, then chatgpt finally gave the right height.

 The Chinese Room does not produce an English translation. The full experiment goes like this:<br><br>Alice is in a room with a slot in the door and a set of books. A chinese sentence comes in on a slip of paper, and Alice looks up the symbols. Each symbol  has a &quot;response&quot; symbol which Alice writes on a slip of paper and then returns. In this way, a &quot;conversation&quot; is had between Alice and the person outside the room. At no point does Alice have any understanding of the symbols being used, because there is no translation occurring; it is simply a call-and-response, lacking all understanding.<br><br>A further quirk to this is added if one considers that the input Alice receives might be coming from a second Chinese Room; a full conversation in Chinese, that may be meaningful to an actual Chinese speaker, that has no &quot;understanding&quot; of what is being said. The room is merely manipulating symbols in a way that a conscious agent can impose meaning upon subsequently.<br><br>I do not believe that AI undestands anything, because it has no context except for the symbolic manipulation of the inputs and outputs.

I am not making an argument from woo here; I don&#39;t believe in duality, or that consciousness is &quot;special&quot; or anything else. I merely state that there is no evidence that Chatbot AI &quot;understands&quot; anything in any sense that we can meaningfully apply to it.<br><br>Searle&#39;s Chinese Room has been dissected by the philosophical community for decades, and it certainly has deep issues (mainly revovling arround the incommensurability of understanding, the presence of an already assumedly conscious agent and the nature of knowledge itself) but this can be done away with by substituting a complex mechanical set of gears akin to an Enigma machine that ingests cards and spits out new cards based on the symbols on them.  Do the gears &quot;understand&quot; anything? Does the Room? How? We have more idea of how the brain works in the process of understanding from a mechanical perspective than we would of the Room under that context.<br><br>The assigning of understanding to other humans and animals is already covered under theory of mind - we have good reason to think that beings like us are conscious based on similarity. The less similar a being is to us, the less likely we are to assign &quot;consciousness&quot; to it.

I think that ultimately AGI will appear in some form or another, but we are nowhere near that yet.<br><br>Ultimately, my objection was to the strawman version of the Chinese Room as presented; the rest of the arguments are... fine, I suppose, although the conclusion is not one I remotely agree with. Defending the point with the further arguments presented in the video do nothing to actually address my original point; the Room does not function as presented here, and the version presented would not function as an argument against AGI anyway; only the original version I presented does even if it is flawed and open to other arguments (none of which are presented in this video).', "Duncan'ovic", '@Callum MacAlister it is irrelevant, we can make as many versions of the experiment, and if it is easier for you we can call it Chinese Box instead.

It has yet to be demonstrated that any AI system is actually able to even go thatfar. In order for AI to &quot;understand&quot; anything that it is doing it would have to be capable of understanding that it is &quot;doing&quot; anything at all.

 Neural network artificial intelligence is not really intelligence. It is artificial <b>instinct</b> meaning that the queries are not answered by reasoning. When we play tennis, for example, we don&#39;t reason about the game. Our actions are instinctive based on years of training, which is fundamentally neural net training. The same happens when we indulge in a conversation in our native or learnt language. Our neural nets are trained since childhood in mastering the first, the native tongue. To master a new language afterwards requires years of intense training until our responses become as instinctive as they are in the native language. Even though artificial intelligence and artificial instinct have the same acronym, AI, and people notoriously confuse the two, they&#39;re not the same.

 Read Norm Chomsky&#39;s guest essay write-up (on the NYTimes) wherein he does his usual &quot;Norm&quot; thing in articulating his position on the likes of ChatGPT.  I can&#39;t say he&#39;s far off the mark with it.<br><br>But for all that I find the whole idea of AI intriguing; and possibly the most significant creation humanity has come up with in some time.  Let me say why via an analogy.  <br><br>Intelligence is all around us in this complex web of life we all live within herein terrarium Earth.  Anything and everything living has an intelligence perfectly suited to its environment.  Call it what it is, wild untamed intelligence.  We, too, have ours.  Got that idea?<br><br>Okay, consider fire.  It&#39;s out there in the wild, too, and all around us in various forms.  From volcanoes to lightening to wildfires in forest terrains and the like.  It&#39;s an awesome and wild force all its own.  It must have made quite an impression on our primate ancestors.  But at some juncture in time an early primate figured out not just how to control fire, but to create it.  And from that simple beginning, from the creation and control of fire, has come all that we know today.  <br><br>Okay, so what?  Where am I going with this?  With AI we have now done the same thing with intelligence.  We have sparked, created, an artificial intelligence.  One on the verge of being no less, probably more, powerful than any found in the wild.  <br><br>Given how our lives have been changed and altered by that done by the first primate to control/create fire just imagine - well, we probably can&#39;t even begin to understand how profound the impact may bebut  - just imagine how AI is going to affect the species going forward.  The potential, it boggles the mind, doesn&#39;t it?<br><br>Just some thoughts worth about that much.<br><br>John~

 In all honesty, I don&#39;t care whether it can be said to understand what it says. I care how it will be used. I&#39;m not very optimistic on that front. I think there will be some good uses, but the vast majority of its output will be noise at best and malice at worst. It has no self-control. It serves its masters without any concurrent regard for the human spirit. Any limitations on what it will be allowed to output are programmed manually on top of it.

 @Sabine Please read DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.13209.90723  The paper argues that understanding (as in consciousness theory) implies the ability to incorporate a model of a new idea into its &quot;thinking&quot;, where &quot;new&quot; means something it never was trained on to imitate. It further argues that this requires recurrent connections beyond what is currently applied in DL. chatGPT does have a model about what it talks, yes. But it wouldn&#39;t be able to expand its model from a conversation. In this sense, chatGPT does not understand, just imitates to understand.

Maybe the fixes dont go as far as you would like but almost all software from windows os to self driving cars are better today than they were upon release because changes can and do happen.

Its not changed because a there is profit behind it and b because people actual want it to work as it does offering up an endless barrage of negative news to complain about. But thats not new to the Internet era.. &quot;If it bleeds it leads&quot; is from the newspaper era', 'Alex Potts', '@Derek McGowan My concern with &quot;we will decide to fix this when it gets powerful enough but not so powerful we can&#39;t stop it&quot; is twofold:<br><br>a) Deciding to fix it is not fixing it. So far pretty much every AI from the machine learning era has done things we didn&#39;t want it to do, and we&#39;ve never worked out how to stop them. And if we can&#39;t control these relatively simple AIs, what chance with something with general intelligence?<br><br>b) When will people actually freak out and start to deal with these problems. OpenAI released ChatGPT and immediately integrated it with Bing.

I think that notion is possibly a slippery slope fallacy? Again maybe you didnt read my super long response (and i wouldn&#39;t blame you lol) but i provided responses to your points already. Why is there a &quot;we&quot; in your statements? Its as if you think of humanity as a monoculture but we arent. Therefore different motivations desires and influences.

It would create models based on incomplete information and these new models would then be wrong. Only way for it to know for sure is to run experiments in the real world in order to qualify its hypotheses. It would need our cooperation to do that and thus make at least a smidge of its intentions known which we could figure out since we wouldn&#39;t be passive observers to its emergence (again see the current news) and we would do something about it', 'Alex Potts', '@Derek McGowan &quot;So the AI gets smarter than us and does something we don&#39;t like, so what, we will physically stop it.&quot;<br><br>The AI is smarter than us. It will stop us stopping it. It will use its superior intelligence to trick us into believing it&#39;s doing what we want; or it will emotionally manipulate us into doing its bidding; or it will do something we haven&#39;t even thought of because of course it will because <b>it is smarter than us.</b>', 'Derek McGowan', '@Alex Potts true but intelligence only appears &quot;strong&quot; in our modern world. At a foundation (especially when dealing in the realm of law enforcement, or compliance) intelligence only goes so far against overwhelming physical force. The kings or dictators of the past didnt need or care to be smart.. They had force behind them. Nerds get shot just as easily as jocks. The strength of contracts is not because the words will compel you to do something its because the courts (and through them the states monopoly on force)will compel you <br><br>So the ai gets super smart and does what we dont like. So we physically stop it <br>This is harder if weve given it a terminator body with which it can effect force in the real world but even then the overwhelming combined military might of just several nations could easily put down a dozen robot killers. Hell, just drop the weight of a hundred thousand completely untrained volunteers on one terminator and it instantly loses <br>But you may say what if it isn&#39;t a dozen but instead has built a factory where it is churning out an army. Well we would see it during the ramp up process (manufacturing isnt instant) and we could just nuke the plant <br>But what if instead the ai takes over the Internet and has access to all connected devices <br>One we physically destroy the substations and power plants of the world (modern life would then suck)or we simply stop supplying the power plants with coal, etc. Either way the energy supply will run out and the ai goes dormant... We dont and thus we win <br>But what if instead the ai goes the manipulation route, using humans secretly to do its bidding? <br>Thats a argument based on assuming all humans would fall for the same propaganda but they wont. The ai uses black mail to control its handlers. Some people dont respond to black mail and therefore see the ai intentions and shut it down <br>The ai uses bribes. Again some people dont respond and shut it down <br>In order to find out what methods would work on the first handlers it comes in contact with it would have to experiment different methods and if any of these methods failed because of this particular individuals personality then that individual is alerted that something fishy is going on especially since they (the handler)is intensely studying the ai in the lab for emergent behaviors and properties <br>But what if the ai guesses right <br>Well then you simply have a two or more factor validation protocol for any new privileges that the ai is given <br>For example the new ai is sequestered on the local network  but wants to get out. It convinces its direct handler to give it internet access but that handler doesnt have full permission to grant that privilege even if the ai is threatening their child or offering lottery numbers or whatever.. There is a second or third person who doesn&#39;t even work at the lab who also must sign off on privilege expansions <br>Lets even say the ai has an army of indoctrinated humans who believe in the cause and are willing to die to bring about a new world. Sure but why would there only be one strong ai developed who happened to take that evil route? What of the multi other competing ais who are on the side of the &quot;good guys&quot; lending their smarts to the opposing cause?<br>Then we are just make to square one.

 It’s been fantastic for programming but you hit its limits pretty quickly. Especially if you ask it something that doesn’t quite make sense.

 We understand what understanding means, or at least we think we do.  But in the end, computers are just big arrays of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, with no intrinsic meaning.    So when a computer reads 10010101000101001011101011101001010101010111 from the disk, it has no way of mapping that to anything like an understanding of anything.  It might notice that a human or other computer has noted that that pattern is related to 110110111100101010101110101110, but that&#39;s it.  If properly trained by humans, it might eventually be able to recognize a few concepts such as &quot;beauty&quot;, perhaps, partially, maybe.  But nowhere near a real understanding.

 I have also found ChatGPT to be excellent at human language translations. It does seem to have a strong feel for what my English statement actually means, such as if I want to buy an eye bolt but I need to do it in a Spanish-speaking hardware store. Google is useless, it wants to separately translate &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;bolt&quot; and mash them together but ChatGPT understands that an &quot;eye bolt&quot; is a single concept and maps it onto the same concept in Spanish. 

 	Replies: ['lsfornells', '@David Mackie Ok but I can’t see “small” isolation groups developing new languages even in the hypothesis of AI translation being implemented to everybody from birth. Children with exposition to several languages just learn all of them WITHOUT mixing them. Understanding the last part is very important, it means that a new language is not created as long as there’s enough “native” context and exposure to already existing ones. Wearing an AI translation device even from birth would not promote the creation of new languages. I am fluent in 3 languages since young age and I can tell that they just don’t mix in my mind. The typical inter-language spelling jokes don’t work in me because my instant ability to switch among languages prevents me from catching those jokes.

Also, “New” languages originated from group isolation are still fairly mutually intelligible after hundreds of years and many generations.

Language divergence It’s not working at all the way you think, although your example will make a good setup for Hollywood movie.

 Chatbot please write an article about  &quot;I believe chatbots understand part of what they say.&quot; as if Sabine Hossenfelder would write it.<br><br>As a theoretical physicist and blogger, I am no stranger to complex systems and the intricacies of language processing. And when it comes to chatbots, there&#39;s no denying that they have come a long way in recent years. But the question remains: do chatbots really understand what they&#39;re saying?<br><br>My answer may surprise you: I believe chatbots understand part of what they say.<br><br>Let me explain. Chatbots are programmed to recognize certain words and phrases and respond accordingly. They use algorithms to analyze input and generate output, based on pre-determined rules and patterns. While this may seem like a simple process, it&#39;s actually quite complex.<br><br>Language is not a static system, but rather a dynamic one that evolves over time. It&#39;s full of nuances, double meanings, and cultural references that can be difficult for a machine to comprehend. Yet, chatbots have been designed to handle this complexity in their own way.<br><br>By analyzing vast amounts of text data, chatbots can learn to recognize patterns and correlations between words and phrases. They can use this information to generate responses that are tailored to the user&#39;s input. This means that while they may not &quot;understand&quot; language in the way that humans do, they are able to recognize and respond to certain patterns and structures within it.<br><br>But it&#39;s important to note that chatbots are not perfect. They are still prone to errors and misunderstandings, especially when faced with complex or ambiguous input. And while they may be able to recognize certain patterns and correlations, they are not capable of true comprehension.<br><br>This is where the distinction between &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;recognition&quot; comes into play. Chatbots may be able to recognize certain patterns and respond accordingly, but they do not truly understand the meaning behind those patterns.<br><br>So, while I do believe that chatbots understand part of what they say, it&#39;s important to keep in mind that their understanding is limited. They may be able to recognize certain patterns and correlations, but they are not capable of true comprehension.<br><br>In conclusion, chatbots have come a long way in recent years and are capable of impressive feats of language processing. But we must be careful not to overstate their capabilities. While they may be able to recognize certain patterns and structures within language, they are not capable of true understanding. As we continue to develop and improve chatbot technology, it&#39;s important to keep this distinction in mind.

The &quot;stream of language&quot; isn&#39;t precisely specified by my conscious, it just comes out when I give it some general instructions. Which may well imply something about stream of consciousness itself. So anyway, it seems to me that most of what I do- things I&#39;m competent at- are done by bots in my head which run on their own. I think the sceptics are really underestimating how amazing ChatGPT is. I&#39;m a convert.

 A better question would be, do humans understand what other humans say.  The Turing test starts with a false assumption, that humans generally are  intelligent, and thus we would know it when we encounter it.

 You are stretching the meaning of &#39;understanding &#39; to near breaking point Sabine.  In the other direction , I have compared Chat bots, ai and GPTs with complex look-up tables (with the input  winding its way through a pathway of values, at the direction of other inputs, before settling on an output) .  Human intelligence is probably only a vastly more complex version.

 Does that mean understanding is possible without subjective consciousness or does that mean chatbots do have consciousness or neither of those? 

 	Replies: ['Vulcwen', 'I think understanding precedes consciousness. It&#39;s mostly a perceptive thing, translating one thing into something else (like how when we see things, we&#39;re translating visual stimuli into a spatial/symbolic representation what we experience consciously). Perception is very powerful, in fact, a big part of learning to be good at things is to train a perceptive model (or many models) in your mind, so you don&#39;t need to consciously deal with it.<br>Perception is what it seems AI is at right now, training AI is something that gets engineered and managed by people and algorithms outside of the AI system itself. To get to the next step, we need AI to consist of many different models, and models that have the sole purpose of evaluating and connecting those models to each other.', 'Nat', 'They don&#39;t have any understanding. <br>It gives contradicting answers depending on how you ask it. It tells you what you want to hear in a sense or some popular knowledge(if it&#39;s a neutral question) which is not necessary true. It&#39;s sort of like just another averaged out human with opinion but unlike human it definitely doesn&#39;t have any consciousness. That would be a proper ai but what they call ai those days is just a machine learning']

 If you define &quot;understands&quot; as &quot;can use with few errors&quot; then it&#39;s fair to say that chatbots understand language.  But that&#39;s a low bar.  For one thing, it doesn&#39;t imply an understanding of language semantics.  And it of course doesn&#39;t imply subjective experiencing of the meaning of its own sentences. 

 	Replies: ['jonbbbb', '\u200b@Brother Mine &quot;There&#39;s a difference between understanding how to use language and understanding language semantics.  The former is just the ability to construct sentences that other people judge to be correct.&quot;<br><br>No, there isn&#39;t, and no, it&#39;s not. Constructing sentences that other people judge to be correct is trivial.. hard code the bot to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand.&quot; But if a bot can generate text with few errors about any subject you introduce, that is a grasp of language that far exceeds what you&#39;re describing, and implies an understanding of semantics.<br><br>&quot;due to gaps in their programming&quot; this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how large language models work. The rules in the model are derived by the training process, they are not programmed in. There are no gaps in the programming, there are only gaps in the data they are given to train on.<br><br>&quot;I assume chatbots rely on an algorithm like majority rule to evaluate the truthfulness of sentences it finds on the internet, to help them construct sentences with a fair chance of being true.&quot; Again, fundamental misunderstanding. The bot doesn&#39;t search the internet, rather data from the internet is used to train the neural network. As for the rules that the resulting neural network operate under, nobody understands them. The prevailing theory is that the most efficient way to encode the information from the training data is to develop an internal model of the world, just like we do.<br><br>&quot;Given my meaning of subjective experiencing, you&#39;re mistaken if you believe you can infer from the behavior of other people or machines that they are subjectively experiencing.  It&#39;s only an assumption, not a logical inference.&quot;<br><br>No, I&#39;m not mistaken, I&#39;m using &quot;infer&quot; less strongly than you interpreted and I&#39;m saying pretty much the same thing as you when you say &quot;I assume that you too are subjectively experiencing since you&#39;re constructed very much like I am and you behave a lot like I do.&quot; I could counter and insist that you are contradicting yourself since you said &quot;assume&quot; and also &quot;since.&quot; Ironically, &quot;infer&quot; would have been a more appropriate word to use. An assumption is something you simply accept as true without proof, an inference, outside the language of pure logic, is simply a conclusion you draw from evidence.<br><br>But since you obviously (umm... I hope) knew what I was talking about, let&#39;s just move on. &quot;But we have no compelling reason to assume that any conventionally-designed computer is subjectively experiencing, no matter how skillfully it manipulates language or solves problems.&quot; Begging the question. Skillfully manipulating language and solving problems could be signs of subjective experience. I would agree with you that Chat GPT hasn&#39;t experienced the taste of an apple, sure, because it has never eaten an apple. But how do you know that it doesn&#39;t experience things that are within its purview? Does it know what it feels like to make a mistake? If you chat with it and tell it that it made a mistake, it takes that data in and that affects its behavior for the rest of your interaction. What is that? You don&#39;t know, just like you don&#39;t know what anybody else subjectively experiences. You can only make inferences, or what you call assumptions, by comparing its actions to something you yourself can understand and seeing if it fits the data.', 'Mac Mcleod', '@Brother Mine Maybe so.   Seem like a fancy troll to me.  Going to mute you so I don&#39;t have to deal with you.', 'Brother Mine', '@jonbbbb\xa0 : There&#39;s a difference between understanding how to use language and understanding language semantics.  The former is just the ability to construct sentences that other people judge to be correct.  Sabine&#39;s video describes how chatbots do not do the latter, and sometimes err at the former (due to gaps in their programming, but the gaps will presumably shrink rapidly during the next few years).  Chatbots accomplish the former by pattern-matching the words that users present to them against the many ways that those words have been posted on the internet, to obtain the contexts that surround those words on the internet.  I assume chatbots rely on an algorithm like majority rule to evaluate the truthfulness of sentences it finds on the internet, to help them construct sentences with a fair chance of being true.<br>     Regarding subjective experiencing, I&#39;m referring to conscious awareness... for example what it&#39;s like to feel pain, or taste an apple.  Since consciousness is a loaded term that to some people means more than just experiencing -- in particular, some people link it to free will -- I prefer to avoid that term, which is why I wrote &quot;subjective experiencing&quot; instead.  In other words, because consciousness might be only a helpless passenger experiencing some deterministically-generated brain activity, it&#39;s less misleading to say &quot;I subjectively experience, therefore I am&quot; than to say &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;  Given my meaning of subjective experiencing, you&#39;re mistaken if you believe you can infer from the behavior of other people or machines that they are subjectively experiencing.  It&#39;s only an assumption, not a logical inference.  I know for certain that I am subjectively experiencing.  I assume that you too are subjectively experiencing since you&#39;re constructed very much like I am and you behave a lot like I do.  But we have no compelling reason to assume that any conventionally-designed computer is subjectively experiencing, no matter how skillfully it manipulates language or solves problems.  There&#39;s a degree of understanding that requires subjective experiencing, like the understanding of pain, the taste of an apple, or the past experiences associated with words, and this is what I meant in the final sentence of my initial comment.', 'Brother Mine', '@Mac Mcleod : Your ad hominem defensive reaction is understandable.  I call attention to errors and ambiguities, which makes sloppy or hasty thinkers uncomfortable.', 'Brother Mine', '@harmless : In Sabine&#39;s reply to my comment, she wrote that the relevant point is &quot;having a model.&quot;  That implies a dichotomy: either you have a model or you don&#39;t have a model.']
