 It is not bad, but it could be better. The formats are standard across every system. I built a whole document on it and even showed how to take programs apart one operation code at a time at CPU level.<br>There is a lot missing, such as magic numbers at the start of the file known as signature numbers that identify the format type and is used for redundancy. How metric is used with the binary size of byte data and bits. All systems read data in bytes in memory which is 8 bits. The order the bytes can be read in can be in little byte order or big byte order and are stored in word grouping sizes. Video memory is stored in pairs of three bytes for each color going to a connected monitor. The bit map picture format is a hardware independent picture format as it can be written directly to video memory across all systems and hardware. Graphics cards can compute and set different pairs of three-byte colors as different colors calling graphics drawing functions. The CPU in your computer can also write pairs of three bytes to any position in video memory, changing a color on your display. Video memory exists in game consoles and computers and is generally the same RGB format. Text is standardized across all game consoles and computer devices to allow text-based communication; see the Unicode standard <a href="https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html">https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html</a>. Audio wave files store audio as is without compression and can be played directly across systems, much the same as a bit map picture. All processors that are x86 understand the same machine code operations since the 8086 processor in the 1980&#39;s and can run dos natively. Native machine code that computers understand as instructions are standardized by processor type. A x86 compiled program will run on an x86 core without translations. An ARM type core will not run x86 instructions as it runs ARM-encoded binary instructions. The graphics memory (video memory) and audio formats are read and displayed the same even if we are on an ARM core running ARM-encoded machine code instructions. You may also like a article that me and a couple of people helped clean up on the mac OS application format.<br>.<br>Another thing to take note of is that the word and grouping size of bytes have different type names such as integers, when we use binary as a 8bit number or 16bit number in word grouping size as bytes. Floating point numbers comprise of a sing, exponent and mantissa and may sound complicated, but actually is very simple and are the same across processor cores and hardware. It is amazing how very little changes between systems. The thing that does change is the speed and performance that newer hardware can operate at. Also, the introduction of callable functions we can call that do processing for us that are dedicated to do a particular task requiring a driver. The ability to switch operating systems. Other than that, the base binary formats never really change, and even machine code and compilers do not change much unless we introduce new operation codes that once did an undefined operation on older x86 cores or ARM cores to speed up a calculation. 

 	Replies: ['Damian Recoskie', 'Once you understand the standards, it also makes it easy to take any software or program apart also, considering machine code and encodable operation codes are standardized by core type, such as x86 runs x86 encoded binary instructions.<br>I also plan to clean up how Microsoft and ELF files are read. I did a lot of cleanup work on the Mach-O application format on Wikipedia and even built my own decompiler. Other than that, I am glad to see someone putting in some effort to better explain the simplicity and standardization of different binary formats and data types and how they are read and processed. I also really like your style and video presentations. You are very talented.']

 A lot of this does reinforce my base knowledge of how things work in computers (which is probably what the title of the video should have been since the video is concerned with transistors, graphics, etc.). Yet I&#39;m sorry, but the part about instructions is rushed and does not grant any insight into how things are done at the firmware level. That being said, this is not a video without a value.

 This is a really good, intuitive, 1000 mile flyover of computing. I just have one gripe, one tiny, little issue which is the explanation of why. First of we also use analog data processing, which is processing data at its voltage, interference be damned. And we have methods to minimize interference for them. But I get that is another rabbit hole to go down, I just feel it would have been nice to mention. The 2nd is that it&#39;s not so much that other systems are too susceptible to interference, I mean they are but again with analogue we have ways to minimize that. The real issue is that there aren&#39;t any particularly useful applications that involve any more than 2 states. You can get some speed efficiency sure, but for any greater than binary logic gate you can just run more binary logic gates in parallel. For example, why use a quaternary gate when you can just make a system that handles bytes, which is what we did.

 How does the computer &quot;count&quot; consecutive 1s and consecutive 0s? <br>If zero volts on a data line is a 0 bit and the byte is something like 00001100, then the voltage would simply be off-on-off. <br>Is there clock synchronization between the data sender and receiver? i.e. if voltage high for 2x time =11. If voltage low for 5x time =00000?

 I‚Äôm a software engineer. About mid level. I rarely have to deal with this type of stuff cuz of course it‚Äôs all abstracted away by the time it gets to the high level programming languages‚Ä¶but man I love watching your videos. It brings me back to my college days when we briefly had to learn about this stuff. There‚Äôs something truly magical about binary and hexadecimal representation of data. Thanks for all your hard work. Your videos always have great explanations as well as great animations to back them up. I hope you keep at this and keep enjoying the process of making these videos.

 If we use the light spectrum instead of electricity to represent the 1s and 0s... Couldn&#39;t we combine a red, green, and blue light together to make a white light as the output?<br><br>In my example, wouldn&#39;t that be analogous to sending a 3-bit message in one light beam? As opposed to sending three 2-bit messages via electrical on/off combinations. 00 = off, 01 = red, 10 = blue, 11 = green?<br><br>I&#39;ve read a little bit about optical computing but, why aren&#39;t we using fiber optics or something to create a light-based system?

 Add the fact that Base 10 is probably used so prevalently by humans because 10 fingers, but requires 10 separate symbols, 0-9.  Binary restricts to minimum 2, 0-1, on/off (electricity), etc.  Any fewer just gives constant state.  No choice, very boring.

 	Replies: ['Basic Blob', '@Logicked Mazimoon obviously, but as a informative video the examples are kept simple like eye color. What could another simple term to describe someone in a binary way (yes or no in this example) be? Something that might be the first thing you&#39;d ask in a game of guess who? Maybe &quot;is the person a female&quot;. Not is the person feminine. When the rest of the examples are so binary and simple why would you use a term like femininity instead of another binary term like gender?', 'Logicked Mazimoon', 'Feminine is a presented trait. A boy can be feminine']

 Nothing escapes the gravitational pull of the blackhole when things become so near it&#39;s event horizon, beyond event horizon there&#39;s no turning back everything sucked in by gravity. Nothing can enter a white hole because the white hole spits out bursts of energies coming out not in. Only God can make us enter the white light entrance as He said he can change the effect of the Orion&#39;s belt as another phenomena.

 The black hole engulfs using it&#39;s very strong gravitational pull, objects, things, planets, stars, and galaxies can be engulfed by a black hole depends on size because the center of every spiral galaxy has shining center hole gravitational pull that can become blackhole though blackholes can reappear anywhere in space, area of the blackhole has large something, a universe. The other side of blackhole after entering the worm hole is a black nothing space but the exit from the wormhole is a rare white hole that seldom appears and that white hole spits out strong energies that can create a universe in the other side and there are plenty of black holes and seldom white holes meaning there can be many universes created in a thin dimension between black holes and white holes, called multiverse which are space polarities by itself and it goes on and on like number 9 which is continuous, goes on and on the universe on 1 side to 0 to the other side and filling up the 0 to something as 1 and again 0 on the other side from thin to wide, from wide to thin on and on and on.

 1 signifies singularity in science, 1 signifies spiritual balancing like the 1 God in spirit God the Father, Christ and holy spirit in the good side and evil 1 in the dark side, 0 means nothing, to suffer, to shadow, people as in row though they have varieties claiming the row, and everything was created out of nothing or 0, because if there&#39;s something on the other side, something will be created from nothing and when that nothing or 0 have something already, the other side of them will be 0 again or nothing.

 Using binary is just playing a game of 20 Questions, except it&#39;s more like 8 Questions, 16 Questions, etc. Something I often say is that while binary is how computers work on the level of individual wires, you could argue that from the point of view of the CPU, it&#39;s more accurate to say that the computer works in binary-coded base 256. The exact wording is borrowed from &quot;binary-coded decimal,&quot; which uses 4 bits to represent a decimal digit. The same logic can be used to argue that our clocks aren&#39;t decimal, but rather &quot;decimal-coded base 60.&quot;)<br><br>For an 8 bit number N:<br>Is N &gt; 127?<br>Is (N % 128) &gt; 63?<br>Is (N % 64) &gt; 31?<br>Is (N % 32) &gt; 15?<br>Is (N % 16) &gt; 7?<br>Is (N % 8) &gt; 3?<br>Is (N % 4) &gt; 1?<br>Is (N % 2) &gt; 0?<br><br>In a way, compression sort of works by peeling back the abstraction. Videos are conceptually just a sequence of images, but video compression requires peeling back that abstraction to actually look at what&#39;s in each image and how they differ. Similarly, Huffman coding throws out letters as numbers and instead returns to looking at individual bits to encode each. Compilers act in a similar manner as compressors, de-abstracting the input to produce something that may not be smaller, but is still more efficient to process.

 Rather than firmware I instead would have mentioned MIME types and file headers, since that I think matches closer to what you were referring to, but overall really enjoyed the summarized version of it all.

Linux is nice that on files with no extensions, in the file browser it will label the mime type as an image, text, etc just depending on what it can determine. For the most part though extensions are what is used.

 I&#39;ve been working with bits for quite a while but I haven&#39;t known the &quot;why&quot; of it until now. I also didn&#39;t know that video compressors turned images into instructions, I thought they just used the same bits for similar colors across many frames.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMpNhbMjDj0&amp;t=12m54s">12:54</a> This part is backwards. Voltage is more like the speed of water and amperage is more like the pressure (that is, the number of electrons/water-molecules). - Though to be accurate, the speed <i>comes</i> from the pressure whereas voltage doesn&#39;t specifically come (directly) <i>from</i> it&#39;s current (Ohm&#39;s law notwithstanding). But then, the water/pipe analogy for electricity was always tenuous at best, this is just another example of why it doesn&#39;t quite work. - This is why teachers make the big bucks, because trying to come up with good analogies to explain things is hard.

 When you understand this, you start to understand why computers can be made out of hydraulic pipes, domino chains, interconected brain cells, marbles rolling on slides or wooden gears. The idea of the bit is independent of the physical substrate which encodes it.
