 I have a book for you, it&#39;s relatively short. Legend by David Gemmell. I should also note that it&#39;s worth reading up on when and why this was written... But see if you like it first

 I really didn&#39;t enjoy reading &quot;100 years of solitude&quot;. the, as you say. messiness of the family just graded on me after a while, and by the end it became almost unbearable. I&#39;m not the &quot;I need to relate to what I&#39;m reading&quot; kind, but these characters really pissed me off. it was like Kafka to me, in a way - great author whose books I don&#39;t like reading.

 We have a lot of overlap. <br><br>I enjoy me some Flannery O&#39;Connor. Her short stories are alright, good writing; I like how she&#39;s not afraid to go dark with some of them (A Good Man is Hard to Find), and her twisted Catholic sense of irony (The River). Wise Blood is absolutely great (though the movie sucked shit through a straw); TVBIA on the other hand, is hands down one of the most boring fucking books I have ever, ever read. <br><br>As for Double Indemnity, I sat through half way the movie. That&#39;s all. <br><br>I love Phillip Roth, and The Plot Against America is his best.  <br><br>I read the first chapter of Moveable Feast. Fantastic writing; couldn&#39;t keep my attention after that, though. <br><br>Marquiz is one of the biggest bores. Ever. I read No One Writes to the Colonel. Such a slim book, took months to read. Kill-me-now boring. I also tried to read Autumn of the Patriarch multiple times. Lost my place. Christ, the goddam boredom. So monumental, it humbles. To hell with it. <br><br>And Steinbeck is also a stupendous bore. <br><br>Anyway, good video (I actually came here from your Elmore Leonard video, whom I also enjoy).

 Jake, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for the content you regularly put out. I&#39;m doing my best not to sound pedantic, but in case I fail, apologies in advance: There&#39;s a million &#39;booktubers&#39; on this platform, and most of them sound like little more than hype machines for the most popular best-selling franchises out there. All of their videos talk about books, but as if they were just products you bought to decorate your pristine, methodically composed shelves. They value premium editions and differences between book covers. You compare their channels and in all of them you find reviews of the same five or six topical fantasy series (I get it; I know how YouTube works, but still). You, Jake, on the other hand, genuinely seem like someone who really reads a lot of different books, without pretensions, and value them for what they are as works of art. I really appreciate you picking poetry for your suggestions, for example, as well as older pieces of literature, that aren&#39;t as marketable. In a world dictated by algorithms, where Arts and Humanities are ever more often frowned upon, I think we&#39;re veering towards an increasingly colder, utilitarian way of experiencing books. What seems to matter most are the number of pages of a book, it&#39;s ranking on a tier-list, or the respect it gets you in a fandom. The obsession with spoilers makes it seem as if knowing the ending of the book was the most important thing about it, the sole reason to read it. And I think it&#39;s a shame. My Literature teacher used to say that the great benefit of the written page is the freedom it gives to the reader. You can read and re-read the same paragraph time and time again, you can linger on the same page until it really sinks in. You can even skip an entire chapter at your own risk - it&#39;s your right as a reader. What really matters is that the reading experience is your own. And nothing compares to picking up an old book you&#39;ve read more than once and being surprised by details you had never noticed before, or recognising how your perspective changed on them. Books are truly one of the best ways to evaluate our personal growth, and much more than novelty items.

 I really recommend &quot;A Different Drummer&quot; by William Melvin Kelley. I just finished reading it this week, and it might be one of the most impactful and thought-provoking reads all year long. Originally published in 1959, the book is a great exploration of race, othering and an individual&#39;s will to break the past. Give the synopsis of it a look and you will be completely hooked by the idea of the story and the writing is just exquisite.

 I tried reading Faulkner on your recommendation from another video and it was the most boring, unrelatable, slow paced plot I‚Äôve ever read. (As I Lay Dying). Like I liked the metaphor about the kid thinking his mom is a fish because he has never dealt with before but if only the ideas are fun and not the story then I‚Äôd rather just listen to someone discuss the ideas instead.

 Recommendation here; Raymond Carver stories. They&#39;re short, very impactful and sort of eerie/bizarre, but human and relatable . His writing is very clean and has a lot of this deceptive lack of intensity. I&#39;ve read What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, which I liked a little more, and Cathedral. I hope you check them out or anyone else reading this!

 Its so good to know you like Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, he&#39;s writing is some of the most beautiful ever. For anyone interested, he wrote two other books that are as good as Cien a√±os de soledad: El oto√±o del patriarca, and El amor en los tiempos del c√≥lera. Also, he really was influenced by a previous latin american writer, who wrote stuff using the same lyrical and dreamlike style: Miguel √Ångel Asturias.

 I love Cannery Row. I&#39;m excited to check out these recommendations. Cannery Row reminds me (mostly through the name, but also a bit through the portrayal of the working class) of a collection of three stories by Takiji Kobayashi called The Crab Cannery Ship, which I would recommend. The eponymous story is about the crew of a crabbing ship traveling between northern Japan and Russia, and their struggles to fight for better working conditions. The other two stories are also worth reading, they give an intimate perspective of communist activities in 20s and 30s Japan.

 I&#39;ve really been enjoying &quot;If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler&quot; by Italo Calvino. It&#39;s one of the strangest fiction books I&#39;ve read that, to me, gets at the heart of why I love to read. It&#39;s mostly second person, and because it is originally an Italian work, I sometimes wonder if the act of translation plays a part in the complex sentence and paragraph structure. I haven&#39;t finished it, but I believe it will be one of my comfort books.

 The book for The Princes Bride is so weird and meta and wonderful. It is written as if it was a translation of an older book and manages to play with that concept in such a wonderful way. If you ever wondered why the story in the film is told as a book being read by a grandfather to his grandchild it was to preserve some of that meta analysis of the story that the book does.

 The non fiction book that I read this year, which has stuck with me even months after I read it, is the book Alaric the Goth: An outsiders history of the fall of rome, by Douglas Boin. Fascinating book on a time in history people talk a lot about but rarely look at critically. The book is fantastic because as you read it youll be able to see the parallels between the late Roman Empire, and the many late capitalist imperialist powers of today.

 Gabriel Garcia Marquez often said that Gregory Rabassa‚Äôs translations‚Äîespecially for 100 Years‚Äîwere better than his Spanish. He was likely just being modest, but it really speaks to how well the English translation captured the nuances of the original work!

 Looking forward to checking these out<br>Also I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read much David Sedaris, but they&#39;re an author I very much enjoy. His books are all mostly collections of humorous short stories about his life, usually with a stretch of short stories in the middle of the book being based around a central arc in his life that the title is based on.  Really fun stuff and some of my favorite reads.

 I have two recommendations, both George Orwell, one fiction and one non-fiction. <br><br>Burmese Days is about an Imperial Police officer Burma and is about colonial society and Imperialism and reflects Orwell&#39;s thoughts about these and his time in Burma (he was an imperial police officer) .  If I remember rightly it was his first novel, and it really got me into Orwell in a way that I hadn&#39;t been able to with 1984 and Animal Farm. (I think they suffer a bit from being &#39;English Lit&#39; books that we all know the plots and themes to already)<br><br>The Road to Wigan Pier is a book of two parts. The first is about the lives and living standards of the working class in the industrial North of England, based on Orwell&#39;s travels their and investigative journalism. The second part is essentially why society hasn&#39;t responded to fix these problems, and why Socialism isn&#39;t more popular, and is a critique of bourgeois left wing cultural mores. Orwell is really good at describing how people lived and the raw statistics of their lives in a way that really brings home the immorality of poverty, and its really interesting both as a picture into the past but also as a comparison to today. The second half is also really interesting to consider in a modern context (Think why do left-wing politicians so often come off as elitists). It was a book that spoke very directly to things I already believed but had never really put into words, and as a snapshot into the lives of (essentially) my ancestors, but I think it would still be interesting from an American&#39;s perspective

 Hey Jake, I usually comment some meme or some joke here, but I have to say, thank you for talking about Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

 In my opinion Cannery Row has the best opening paragraph of any novel I have read:<br>‚ÄúCannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitant are, as the man once said, ‚Äúwhores, pimps, gambler and sons of bitches,‚Äù by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, ‚ÄúSaints and angels and martyrs and holymen‚Äù and he would have meant the same thing.‚Äù<br><br>Also, have you read Steinbeck&#39;s &#39;Tortilla Flat&#39; or &#39;Sweet Thursday&#39;? Both involve several of the characters and locales found in Cannery Row and are fantastic additions to that world. I especially love &#39;Tortilla Flat&#39;.

 A Moveable Feast!!! That book is so good, feels like Hemingway at his most bitter, but also his most loving. Even though he depicts Fitzgerald in moments of weakness I found it to also border on a sort of admission of love (possibly unexplored romantic love, especially in his conversations about Zelda and the physical descriptions he gives of the guy). Haven&#39;t seen you talk much about Pynchon, so correct if you&#39;ve already read it, but The Crying of Lot 49 is his shortest and probably my favorite book of all time and you should absolutely check it out.

 OK, since you asked, I&#39;ll give you a book recommendation. The Blood of Angels by Johanna Sinisalo.<br>Sinisalo won the Finlandia award with her debut novel, Troll: A Love Story, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s her best. Of the ones I&#39;ve read. This is.<br>A very basic description of the premise is: Colony Collapse Disorder has pretty much rendered bees extinct in North America, and Orpo, who is a bee-keeper in Finland is looking at the disaster from half a world away, hoping his bees don&#39;t die.<br>Now, Sinisalo is the foremost writer in the genre known as Finnish Weird, and that&#39;s where this one goes as well. She&#39;s also likely to have you in tears with intergenerational trauma by the end of the book.

 One Hundred Years of Solitude sounds really interesting, I&#39;m adding it to my list. Don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll actually get around to it, it&#39;s a long list. A Moveable Feast sounds a lot like what I&#39;m currently reading, Naked Lunch. It&#39;s also a semi autobiographical collection of &#39;situations&#39;. It is incredibly grotesque and perverse, but also hilarious. It&#39;s a real trip, I&#39;d recommend it.

 Man, a lot of my favs here. Cannery Row was a defining book of my college years and every time I go back to Flannery I‚Äôm reminded of how technically and emotionally powerful she is.

 I appreciate that you mentioned Cannery Row. I loved that book so much that once I finished it I took a roadtrip to Monterey with my girlfriend specifically to visit the row. Any time someone asks what they should read by Steinbeck to get into him, I say Cannery Row, The Pearl, or The Red Pony.<br><br>One other short book I enjoy is called Arise and Walk by Barry Gifford.

 For anyone wanting to pick up One Hundred Years of Solitude, please really consider reading content warnings for this book before! If you have any sensitivity concerning familial abuse, se*ual abuse of spouses and children as well as incest, animal abuse and much more, maybe don&#39;t pick up this book. Even more than magic and history, these topics are the central part of this novel.<br>Tbh, I&#39;d recommend The House of Spirits by Isabel Allende instead as the (imo) superior South American magic realist history and family drama (also with its own slew of content warnings, but better at dealing with them and unpacking them more).
