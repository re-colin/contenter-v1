 One of that the language of expression apart from habits of indent of voice or sway of idea of being version in billions plus or minus being clothed in different realms clothes of high status to low status segregate, to expression and idea inner and outer self interact of a sincere word separated into unsincere word then a billion plus or minus possible event superposition per self version in a mode of expressive language to mind interact of that many in a supersystem?

 Can a billion plus or minus  language words be minimized simplified into several words likened to comprehend expression by multi knowledge in concise whether a code or not?

 I wish you had posted this in 1984. It would have cleared up so much confusion.

 For me it&#39;s refreshing enough to find channels that do not use A.I. voice, heh

 The most fun I ever had on any computer was doing machine/assembly language on my Apple 2e.<br>Load Accumulator ;)

 i learned C at college for Automation (best ever for that) but you can &quot;call assembly commands&quot; within that for Exact movement, not the sort of gaming commands but really useful for robotics.

 LoL-  As a hardware engineer for Data General  1984,  I wrote small programs in machine code by knowing and understanding the assembler codes on Nova and Eclipse systems, 16bit.

 I had to write crude diagnostic programs in machine language. Instead of using GOTO I would have to inted C3, which is the JMP command for the 8080 and 8085 processors. There much more, but it&#39;s been almost 40 years.

 I like omelets. ( Former System/360 Mainframe Assembler Language programmer - Have you had your cards punched and verified? ) Really enjoyed this video. Thank you for refreshing the memory cores.

 Did HND Electronics in the 80&#39;s, had to learn Assembly Language for programming Z80, still got the pages of codes  to use. we also learned pascal. Them C64 commands brought back some memories. LOL.

 You are a national treasure.<br>I did Pascal in college. And I knew of Assembly language.<br>Still don&#39;t understand how the addresses in registers convert to say an action figure. Does the register represent 1 pixel, and to create, say, a figure running, you have to create a series of pixels changing colors to create the effect or an illusion of a running figure?<br>Your mastery of machine language is impressive.

 Very interesting but some of you analogies just don&#39;t work and are confusing - for example talking about converting a series of notes into a symphony but it being much more difficult to convert a symphony back to notes. That analogy makes no sense to me because it&#39;s easy to convert a symphony to notes as all you do is convert the music heard for each instrument to notes - it also doesn&#39;t work in terms of your ML example because a symphony is more like a high level language so it&#39;s easier to convert the symphony to notes in that respect.

 Youngsters!!  Late 70’s was responsible for a control data 924 on a flight simulator, learned machine code, card readers, paper tape punches/ readers, etc, than learned “A” language, then HP tech basic, my first easy language.

I just remember that massive print head with the individual wire &quot;hammers&quot; and the ruby at the front.']

 I hate to nitpick,  but Assembly does NOT use s Compiler, it uses an Assembler.  A Complier converts high level instructions into Assembly,  then it converts the Assembly into Machine Code.

 24secs into it,  I see some basic,  and hear a vic20 and c64 reference,  my first two computers.  I&#39;m so ready for this.

 OK. But you didn&#39;t explain how machine language works. You explained what machine language IS. Big difference. How does a processor see a series of bits and these bits cause the processor to add a number to the number in accumulator A? THAT would be &quot;how machine language works.&quot; But that is, perhaps, for a different audience. <br><br>Also, you were a bit dodgy on interpreters, but I understand this is a just an overview. Still and all, it is a good video.

 I used to be pretty good at 6502 assembly.  I wrote an answering machine program for my Franklin Ace 1000 using an AD/DA card and modem card.  It recorded digitized messages to floppy disc.
