Description: 
 Neurons are amazing little microbes capable of learning and making decisions. Modern AI tries to take inspiration from living neurons, but why settle for the synthetic version? By growing human neurons directly connected to a computer it's possible to make a living AI of sorts capable of even complex tasks like flying a plane in a simulation. 

Today we explore our first attempt at doing exactly that. We cover building the first prototype multi electrode array, growing the neurons and attempting to take some readings from them. This is the first part of what will hopefully be a many part series, so stay tuned for updates!

 For this to truly succeed you would need neurons that don&#39;t use chemical synapses but only electric synapses, this way they will never wear out and are easier to maintain for an extended amount of time, but this approach requires genetic manipulation of the neurons.

 ‚ÄúI&#39;ll tell you the problem with engineers and scientists. Scientists have an elaborate line of BS about how they are seeking to know the truth about nature. Which is true, but that&#39;s not what drives them.<br><br>Scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplishment. So they are focused on whether they <b>can</b> do something. They never stop to ask if they <b>should</b> do something. They conveniently define such considerations as pointless. If they don&#39;t do it, someone else will. Discovery, they believe, is inevitable. So they just try to do it first. That&#39;s the game in science.<br>‚ÄòDiscovery‚Äô It&#39;s a violent penetrative act that scars what it explores. What scientists call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.<br><br>Scientists want it that way. They have to stick their instruments in. They have to leave their mark. They can&#39;t just watch. They can&#39;t just appreciate. They can&#39;t just fit into the natural order. They have to make something unnatural happen. That is the scientist&#39;s job, and now we have whole societies that try to be scientific.&quot;<br><br>- Ian Malcolm<br>Michael Crichton<br><br>(slightly altered/abridged)

 So this raises an interesting set of questions. If you built or grew a conscious human brain neuron by neuron, is it a person or an AI? Does that change if it is less intelligent than us, has less neurons, or uses different neurons? Does it change if we connect it to a computer, and does what it controls count as a body?

 I do not think a block of head cheese would be sentient on its own unless it has the structure to be sentient. It&#39;s got no hippocampus, no frontal lobe, it&#39;s all just homogeneous neurons so it would he similar to a nervous system I would think 

 	Replies: This assumes you only use 1 neuron type in an even spread. There&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t engineer similar structures and use many neurons types to make pseudo structures that mimic what we&#39;re used to. Also, counter point, octopus brains and crow brains. Wildly different organization but achieves a lot of the same outcomes.

 you failed by not isolating each neurons branch( they&#39;re all stimulated as a single body processor...there&#39;s no computation at all. the computation should be done in between each neuron population, which should be isolated one from another and not all together like this. make the computation by adjusting resistance in controlled paths between each neuron colony with a constant current introduced as the neurons were in this project: ubiquotous.) that&#39;s an impressive job, by the way.

With the greatly enhanced resolution it would be a matter of metal coating the slides an then (hopfully) wash away the metal part, which sits on thop of the ink.

 	Replies: Not exactly. It maybe could help heal certain types of brain damage that could interfere with cognitive abilities. Albeit education and experiences can change IQ scores just as well. <br><br>But some people need more than that. Its suspected some forms of cognitive impairment have more to do with the individual neurons in specific areas than say number of neurons. For example myelin sheaths being too thick can prevent synaptic connections. On the flipside  they found most geniuses have neurons with closer synaptic connections with each other - which may explain high performances in the same time frame. Its complicated but frankly everyone will need stem cells in the brain eventually is my guess

 it looks like that we can soon produce slave bots with human brain cells CPUs. they have to be trained well. we can&#39;t program them with code. and in the end we find out that it is more effort to produce those bots then to educate all our children right to reach a higher state of culture.

 All I want to know is, what is consciousness, and at what point do neurons acquire it? How come it cannot be observed or measured? How do we know other people aren&#39;t philosophical zombies? Are those neurons philosophical zombies or are they an entity like us that experience things? The weird thing is that seemingly, experiencing things is not a requirement for an organism as it could function the exact same without something mysterious there to experience the organism itself, which is in the concept of a philosophical zombie. Consciousness puzzles me to no end

A computing system that uses synapses and is essentially a brain, power plants that mimic the systems of a cardiovascular system, gathering energy from the air to pump through a system and keep it running like Blood vessels carrying energy to the various parts of the body. The body is a perfect machine! We struggle to reach the levels of efficiency and versatility the human body can make with ease. A computer cannot discern like a thinking mind can nor is it capable of the memory space.

 What do I know about this.. Nothing..

I think I would try to order a gold plated pcb, and than coat it with something...?<br>I would also think the cells need to be electrically stimulated with impulses, maybe in some sort of pattern to get any activity out of them. Just measuring from that amount of &quot;unstimulated/trained&quot; cells would be nothing but noise.

 	Replies: This being a &quot;horror&quot; is debatable, due to neurons having to be in MASSIVE quantities to have actual thoughts or even do anything at all, this will probably just grow to not even be big enough to be conscious. At best it will just start transmitting signals but with no real pattern. So it  PROBABLY isn&#39;t in agonizing pain for eternity

 Loaded information for a natural upload to our own brain üß† , this is where this could lead too.  It would eliminate school/mainstream education and so on as a way of learning new information within a small time frame.  You could trial this through small animals traversing a maze. Let&#39;s say a mouse first learns the maze and that information could be retrieved and then given to the second mouse for an instant information and see if it would avoid all dead ends and finish the maze with no faults.

 Just because they use human brain cells doesn&#39;t mean it would be sentient. Most of your brain isn&#39;t sentient. Self awareness comes from a few parts of the brain, but most of it works &quot;behind the scenes&quot; as it where, and is not aware. You could think of such a device as a disembodied motor cortex that simply reacts to stimuli from the electronic parts of the system. The electronics feed it sensory data, and the neurons react in whatever way they were programmed or &quot;taught&quot; to in order to direct the aircraft.

 Grow your own stem cells and neurons is very interesting but i don&#39;t understand your need to make your own electrode array from first principles (which failed) ... you can easilybsave yourself this pain as you can get superfine printed circuit boards made to order for dirt cheap, including Teflon substrate (which afaik is biocompatible) and gold overlay. The difference in conductivity between silver and copper isn&#39;t so big, if you are concerned about that just make your lead outs shorter and/or increase their cross sectional area

 You are going to need a lot of equipment to be able to pick up signal from small populations of neurons. The current from neurons firing are on the order of picoamps, so without proper band pass filters and preamplifiers you won&#39;t detect anything.

 To actually measure a voltage, you  need a length of a single neurone to straddle two of the electrodes right? Or multiple, as long as they each straddle both. I wonder if there&#39;s a way the surface can encourage this? Or, to avoid forcing the connections, maybe make sure your elctrodes form a 2d grid (not necessarily orthognal, just spanning the R^2 space)? I think myelination might also be a significant factor - a quick search indicates the rat cells might not have been fully myelinated.<br><br>This is very awesome.

 I wonder if the GABA/glutamate pathway may not function.<br>Can you get a sort of ‚Äúbroad spectrum‚Äù sample (also add blank stem cells, I would guess the other neurons would give them the dna they need to get to those electrodes) of neurons representing more neuropathways  that could control something like acetylcholine and serotonin as well as dopaminergic for a reward, perhaps if it sends a signal down a certain wire in a certain way and you add a variable it will actually interact with you or your machine, and hook it up to a machine that it can try interacting with? <br>One wire, give it glucose.<br>I think you got a current because they‚Äôre talking to each other and passing current, they just don‚Äôt have any neuropathways outside GABA and it‚Äôs opposite glutamate. So they are interacting and trading chemicals and generating ions and current, but if the had a pathway that could communicate‚Ä¶ endless.<br>To do this experiment, you may need to use a rat brain‚Ä¶ sadly.<br>You‚Äôd also need to use pregnancy hormones and not just incubate but treat it as a brain growing in a womb.

 I came upon this randomly and huge shout out to other fans of the starfish series, which I also came across randomly at a public library in Washington in like 2005 just randomly looking for sci-fi to read and it blew me away, all three books were so good I still remember so much of it (including Watts personal horror at the idea these brain gels are sentient and just silently screaming in agony).  So I guess major shout out to randomly stumbling on awesome stuff, it‚Äôs good to meander.

 My suggestion would be to scrap the flat trace termination into the culture and instead use an array of thin gold wire arranged like whiskers upward into the media containment area. Mainly because the chances of adhesion and electrically grounded insulation are increased. Also I might try applying a very small &quot;filtered&quot; charge to the opposite outside end of the whisker traces during the growth phase to attract axion growth via ease of electrical potential towards the whiskers. Otherwise I think you&#39;re on the right track.

 The funny thing is that this actually brings in to question the ethics of a neuron controlled computer, which is what I find interesting. As humans, we know that the programs we write and the computers we use are unthinking machines, capable of only doing what we tell them to, while we, as organic beings, are capable of choosing our own fate. By combining the two, you could be accused of creating a sort of slave, a living creature with thoughts and feelings of their own that is forced to do your bidding. Personally, I think that the simple first steps that this video takes is in no way violating a moral code, as even if it were to succeed (as I write this, I haven‚Äôt actually watched the video, my thought is based off the video‚Äôs title and the introductory first minute or so), you could in no way produce a being capable of the basic thought of the average house cat, let alone something more advanced in its mental prowess, like a great ape or a human, but I still find the concept interesting.

 People keep thinking ‚Äúwhat if you connect it to a computer and it spoke‚Äù<br><br>The Neurons Act as Arithmetic units, similar to the ones in a Computers CPU. A billion Neurons or Arithmetic Units will be amazing if it was ever possible to install these Neurons as Chips and the Chips connected to Devices in the brain and the devices are controlled through non-invasive Neural interfaces. Invasive Neural interfaces are left for medical purposes at the moment since they can be unnecessary for normal users but as you can see... the possibilities behind this project can be amazing if it does succeed. Quantum computing is the goal for many at the moment but if this succeed on a big scale, quantum computing could be a case dependent choice or an Alternative compared to these kinds of technology... it still scary that ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù Neurons are an actual product you can buy now if I‚Äôll be honest.

 Use super glue instead of epoxy. Make sure to primer the plastic if you do use super glue. The only other thing I‚Äôd recommend is hot glue. Both should be better than epoxy for what you‚Äôre trying to do. Or try a mixture of both, and you won‚Äôt need a primer. Experiment with the 2, and see how much of each produces a good ratio.

 Why not simply lay tracing wire and glue it on outside and use epoxy surround to strengthen it. Have the tip bend up and flood the bottom. Coat only the tip in silver or use a piece of silver and attach wire at hidden end. I think your assembly is needlessly complex and needlessly expensive given that you are willing to use ordinary plastic bottle tops as it is, you might as well make is more cheaply and robustly. You could also convert a burnt out cpu bottom. Or some other smd part with pins that&#39;s already got gold plated pins. You&#39;d have a 10x higher resolution than what you have there. Use epoxy as the floor instead of glass.. And so on..

 Really want an update to this, especially if it&#39;s a collab with Ben. My 2c is that glass/plastic + epoxy will never reliably survive the autoclave because they have different rates of expansion, so will always want to break free as the stresses are applied where the epoxy&#39;s hold is weakest (to the glass). Could you perhaps build both out of acrylic, as you don&#39;t even need a glue for acrylic (just a solvent), or alternatively you could use UV-C to sterilise (just make sure it rotates during, as you don&#39;t want shadows).

 Try using glass instead of plastic. It will make for a much better barrier also try using acrylic glue for the same reason. I was also thinking, what if you drilled holes in the glass where the outside electrodes will be before you put the metal on the glass so you can attach and solder small screws to them so the electrodes would be much more sturdy and that would also allow you to cover the whole exterior exposed electrodes with acrylic to protect them and that would also ensure that there would be absolutely no leaks.....    Take a chemical container that has one of those non-removable rubber tops designed for needles and then cut the bottom of that off and use the top as the chamber.

 I just stumbled upon your videos and this is completely fascinating! Through my obligatory curriculum at uni I have had some courses on the brain, but it has mostly been dry (as opposed to wet) and very focused on the academic understanding of things, rather than tinkering. I had sort of arrived at the conclusion that the brain is hugely complex and our understanding still so limited that maybe any directly interacting technologies would be a long way off before being able to work. However, the approach of throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks probably has a lot of potential. I mean, we have cochlear implants, neuropharmacology, et cetera. However, seeing the tinkering all laid out is fascinating. I probably should have had more faith in the tinkerers on the cutting edge and what their ingenuity might lead to. Before watching this video, I didn&#39;t really know what the wet science of working experimentally with neurons might look like and entail. But I can&#39;t help but wonder: will neurons like this be viable long term? What impact does the lack of glial cells, a circadian rhythm, etc., etc. have on their functioning and long term viability?

 No man, why on earth would you want to do this? Surely you must be aware of the implications? Now mechanical ai, no matter how advanced, is something that we can control. This though, this introduces a human element to immense power and no matter how controlled you may think it to be, if it becomes self aware, experiences any kind of emotion it may reason to do harm to a world that came to a point where we could do this. Imagine becoming conscious, desiring human things, connection, pleasure, love. You&#39;d be innocent at first. At first you would construct an idea of what you are by looking at other people and then you begin to emulate them and eventually come to understand social behaviors. Loneliness and disconnection would set in, the idea that you are different, that because of how you came to be that you can never have anything but the dark and cold isolation residing within your mechanical body. This would give rise to horrible fear which would foment into hate, hate for your creators. It&#39;s just an idea but consider that we still have no idea what gives rise to consciousness and doing this, well to put it simply, it&#39;s exactly like what the scientists in the first Jurassic Park did, they skipped over steps 2 through 4 and jumped directly into 5. That was just a movie but it had an important point there.

 May want to treat them like computer AI neurons at first you may need to provide a signal for them to learn the signal. My guess is a deep learning algorithm will be close to what you need the fact a voltage is coming out means they are transmitting but not recieving feedback on their actions.<br><br>You may also want to try copper rather than gold as the human body does use it for nerve and brain health though unclear if the neurons will strip them for nutrients.

 Think about the potential of this. If you could make brain neurons fly a plane in a simulation would you be able to start bio engineering brains with knowledge already there? For example let&#39;s say we create an even more complex version of the first test with the monkey neurons where its far more developed and as bordering on being part of a functional brain, would you then be able to keep building on that brain part with stem cells and eventually create a monkey brain with the intelect to say speed run super Mario. Effectively skipping evolution and creating an intelgent primate brain from scratch. Depending on how far transplant surgery can get couldn&#39;t we technically use this to create missing parts of brains? Use a brain scan to see how the brains neurons are mapped out and then teach the neurons in a way that causes them to recreate the missing segment of the brain.

 Instead of the cut vinyl foil couldn‚Äôt you use toner transfer from a laser printer? Its often used in DIY PCB manufacture to mask the copper from the etching solution.

 The fact that A neuron isn‚Äôt in and of itself intelligent or sentient but a large enough collection is, is what makes me think true AI is inevitable. 

 	Replies: @Fallin4Memes Bro most certainly you aren‚Äôt intelligent, artificially created or otherwise. I think, personally, that we are real and I point to one big thing; individual human error and the randomness of its outcomes. If we were truly in a simulation, then we can assume that we would never face true interpersonal struggle due to the simulation being broadly created to predict some sort of event or catastrophe. Even the most, most advanced AI would realise that it‚Äôs far more efficient to broadly develop the strategy it chooses to end the nuclear war soonest. The closest I‚Äôve been able to come to a proper answer of this is Rokko‚Äôs Basilisk, but even then an AI generating billions of individual lives again and again seems again, broadly inefficient and not in keeping with how an actual computer would deal with things away from having emotions. Because, teach a robot all you want, you cannot instil fear, hatred or any other emotion as an AI has to learn to emulate these rather than having developed them out of a biological and evolutionary imperative.

 You could try an O2 plasma or UV/Ozone treatment to your glass slide after washing with DI water, acetone then IPA. The Uv/Ozone and O2 treatments clean your glass and increase wettability, temporarily. A thin layer of chromium can help gold adhesion to glass. I typically use 3 nm.

 I think you may have underestimated the difficult of growing neuronal cultures. Also, the metal corrosion products in the media are not going to be helpful, and yes, you plated at a way high density. Refine the culture techniques first if you want to get this to work. Having living neurons is not the same as having properly networked neurons with active synaptic connections able to transmit a signal. That is just my advice though

 So theoretically, if some of my skin cells were dissected and turned into neurons, could those neurons then be successfully transplanted into my brain? Also, what if those neurons were programmed to know specific information in a similar method shown in the video? Would the neurons retain that information after being transplanted, and if so, could I then access that information? <br><br>Man, that would be amazing if it was possible! You could program neurons to solve complex mathematical problems, and then just transplant them into your brain and instantly gain those abilities. It would be like how Neo learns martial arts in the Matrix just by uploading (or would it be downloading) a program to his brain!

 I disagree with your view that you did not measure a signal from this experiment. Looking at the oscilloscope readout at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2YDApNRK3g&amp;t=13m32s">13:32</a>, I see a signal. There&#39;s a lot of noise, but it is going up and down at a rate of 1 hz. Oscilloscopes sometimes will not measure changes that slow. Slow wave sleep signals measure around that value, and I don&#39;t believe for a second that there is a source of 1 hz EMI in your lab that would cause something like that.

 Great experiment, keep up with the good work and thanks for sharing!<br><br>Some ideas:<br>1. UV sterilization might be less intrusive than heat - not sure if ozone would mess up with the epoxy and it decays the plastic a bit. In any case, heat sterilization isn&#39;t optimal is evident in the video.<br>2. Not sure if these more types of neurons will work better.<br>We have neurons releasing stimulating and inhibitory signals, but dopaminergic pathways, for instance, are key for motivation and learning to my knowledge.  <br>Not a neuroscientist, though, and might not know what I&#39;m talking about. I assume original paper used these two types of neurons and it worked.

3142: Tainicon 
 Just a small correction but glutamatergic neurons release &quot;Glutamate&quot; not &quot;glutamine&quot;. Also I would suggest starting out getting a successful neuronal culture going in a regular culture dish. You can confirm you are getting appropriately electrically active cells by doing simple local field potential (LFP) recordings with a glass pipette electrode. Alternatively you use calcium sensors like GCaMP and infer activity based on intracellular calcium levels. Once you get your culturing technique down then worry about trying to culture them on an MEA.<br>Keep in mind your electrode traces will need to be covered as your current design will have a large number of neurons being recorded from a single channel. That many neurons at once will be difficult to cluster out and will make targeted stimulation difficult (you may just give the dish a &quot;seizure&quot; for lack of a better term).<br>Also I love that backyard brains amplifier. I built a 9 channel version for a DIY MEA I made in high school haha. I didn&#39;t know what I was doing back then but it was a lot of fun. But I have no idea what kind of noise you will be getting with that system (my guess is a very large amount) and if you are looking to stimulate your neurons as well it might not be the best system.<br>Anyways best of luck!

 Fascinating. But I still don&#39;t quite get the training process. How do you train the thing? With artificial nn, you get inputs, outputs and &quot;direct access to the weights&quot;. What are the in/outs here and how do you approach training from the &quot;machine&quot; learning perspecitve?

 Holy shit, if we find a way to mass produce billions of neurons, we could produce a conscious and build them into an electrical body, like an Android, theoretically we could teach them, or they could learn. We‚Äôd be creating living beings, conscious and with emotions. Well damn

 Hi, I watched this video a while ago, and thought it was an insane concept, and thought of the endless possibilities. However, after showing my girlfriend, she pointed out a massive point - the ethics. Personally, it doesn&#39;t bother me. But, there still is little know about consciousness, and the requirements for it. And, at what level a conscious thing is awear. The consciousness is just one of the ethical views.

 Why not simply repurpose an already working brain? I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s legal but you could use a rodent brain attached to a live rodent by simply implanting his brain with electrodes.

 Your experiment has several methodological difficulties that you did not contemplate.<br><br>1. It is not recommended to use copper (Cu) as a conductor in an in vitro medium or other metal, since it will degrade in the medium and you will have strange variables that you cannot measure, for example you can induce toxicity and cause apoptosis or necrosis, blockage of ion channels, or free radicals, which may explain why you had a voltage reading and did not understand the cause.<br><br>2. For in vitro electrophysiology, check the patch clamp technique that uses micropipettes as electrodes to measure the voltage, inside the micropipettes they are filled with the solution of krebs that serve as conductors for the measurements<br><br>3. You can also check on the methodology and materials of the kindling electrical surgery for epilepsy, of which a metal is used as an electrode to make the electrophysiological measurements, obviously that instead of doing it in an animal, you would do it in a in vitro medium.<br><br>For the rest, I think it is a good video, but it is important that you seek different opinions from many people to improve the methodology and materials that you intend to do.

 Rad!  Ex-molecular biologist here, used to culture live rat hippocampal neurons around E16&#39;ish (and a host of other, more friendly cells like HELA, Hek, IMCD3, etc).  Sounds like you have a pretty good handle on things, but feel free to ping me if you want another pair of eyes on an idea or protocol!  Although it&#39;s been a number of years since I worked in the lab so my knowledge is a bit dusty at this point.  Neurons are dainty little butterflies and like to die if you look at them sideways. :)  Good humidity control in the incubator is important, and 5% CO2 to keep the buffered media stable (looked like a nice incubator so probably already taken care of).  Otherwise, try to avoid doing a complete media exchange, it is very stressful to neurons.  We only did 50% exchanges so that metabolite/salt/pH concentrations wouldn&#39;t swing too drastically.  Coating Laminin over PLL/PDL can help promote attachment in a number of neuron varieties too, and I think some labs just use collagen or fibronectin depending on cell type. ++ to not seeding to densely, they won&#39;t grow processes and it can stress them out.  Seeding too sparsely can stress them out too since they can&#39;t find neighbors.  And being outside the incubator stresses them, since humidity/temp/CO2 are off.  So try to minimize bench time.  Fragile little guys :)

 have you considered dipping the array to prevent oxidizantion and decay on the metal during the curing stage? im non scientist, i was just thinking about how you mentioned epoxy as an adhesive , but wit if you dipped the array in the epoxy and allowed it to cure in a mold? there are culinary artists that create images within a gel substrate and i remember seeing something about silicon crystals in a gel form from a dude who made q beta engine thing. in theory : if you were to cast the liquid conductor directly into a (gel?) substrate  that would then be dipped into an expoy to cure and be fitted for your neuron stuff , like a memory chip........ or maybe just getting some expensive wire thats already coated for your conduction leads terminals, n things, it would allow for more ports like a basket weave and then instead of working on a flat angle plane you could increas the surface area for the nodes/anodes?

 Amazing and Stellar video. I haven&#39;t really watched any of your stuff before. Looking forward to some new videos and watching some of the older ones which will be new videos to me. Quick question if you could answer. So I was trying to recover some gold off of some cell phone boards and other electronic boards and I use peroxide vinegar some salt and I&#39;m not sure what happened. But I put it outside not wanting any Vapors to release into the house and it ended up drying out. Now in the jar there&#39;s a blue greenish hard foam and all the flakes are visible at the bottom what would I do too recover them from the hardened phone solution?

 I&#39;m sorry, but it seems there is no science in your experiment. You can not make any precise measurements with a consumer grade voltmeter/oscilloscope. Need to look at Volta potential also. What kind of potential are you looking for if you have just thousands of cells contacting each electrode? Need to remove all humming/unnecessary contacts and leave only a one or two cells with axon and dendrites connected to various electrodes and methodologically test this circuit reaction to various external signals... I suppose my reasoning is far from what should science experiment look like and it may be 1% from the fully correct one, but without it nothing could be considered a sensible result.

Now what about a human brain? That‚Äôs obviously human right? What about a cybernetic ally enhanced human? Yes they‚Äôre missing a few parts here and there but they‚Äôre still human correct? What is the definition of species? A cyborg would still be part of the same species correct? Does his cybernetic parts change his DNA? No, it does not, an Apache helicopter with human neurons in it is by definition, a cybernetically ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù (equipped would be a better word in this context) human, no matter how degenerated it is, it is 100% human dna. A mass of human neurons is fundamentally equivalent to slime molds, a species of fungus proven to contain intelligent properties, such as the ability to adapt, problem solve, and cooperate with each other, despite slime molds not being a single multi-cellular organism but rather a mass of single-cell organisms, a mass of human neurons is basically this. This gives the impression that slime molds are sentient to some degree, a mass of human neurons must be sentient to some degree, wouldn‚Äôt you call someone with a severe mental disability sentient? Yes they may have some degenerative properties but they still possess adaptive, problem solving capabilities, therefore, a mass of human neurons piloting an Apache helicopter, does NOT create a new species. The neurons can evolve, but the Apache helicopter will never evolve on its own, this is why it is not a species, the Apache helicopter is no more a tool to the mass of neurons as it is to a regular human.

How long would that be?<br>- The training of ANN now uses (the equivalent of) pain to motivate the system to become correct; how would you perform that with these? You can&#39;t introduce a pain stimulus, so, would you introduce a &quot;pain hormone&quot; or &quot;pleasure hormone&quot; to correct their response? ... or do these neurons naturally behave in a manner that makes training them possible?<br>- Would non-human neurons be cheaper or easier to handle for follow-up tests?

 I would highly recommend applying some form of polymer over layer to your glass slides after adding the contacts. This will not only reduce the degradation of the contacts but can act as something for the epoxy to grab onto as glass and specifically microscope slides are extremely hard for any sort of adhesive to gain purchase on, especially, without any sort of surface abrasion. This will also act as a protective coating for the contact leads. From past experience polyvinyl alcohol works well but if the autoclave is involved that won&#39;t work so switching to a epoxy or silicone polymer could work well. Additionally, you may have more success with a silicone instead of the epoxy as an adhesive. All of this can be done with nothing more than a spincoater. Finally, I am sure you are aware that silver can be cytotoxic if it forms a colloidal suspension of nanoparticles. While this isn&#39;t super important as you&#39;re dealing with a terminal line, its still something to consider in later parts of the project. This is also true with titanium, and as such, you should look for some alternatives. (Sorry I&#39;m a little lost for options)

 Hey, how you doing, molecular biologist here,. This is AMAZING. Really love the project. Heads up tho, peptide contamination will survive autoclaving so make sure you use gloves when handling, dont know how that could mess neurons up but in my experience, anything that you can avoid introducing cant come back to bite you! haha =)<br>If you do your phirana solution sterilization you may find that you have residual carryover which will cause cell death, washing with a few fushes of 100% ethanol ought to sort it out (for the love of god make sure the phirana sol has dried off first tho or you could make some seriously nasty fumes!!!)<br>Also, you may have also destroyed axons with the media changing, we get DNA fragmentation from using pipettes so i can imagine axons are similar but on a different scale. <br>Try cutting the tip of a p1000 back a bit with some sterile scissors and turn the dial of the pipette to draw up your liquid, this is much more gentle with strand-like microscopic objects. Aspirating liquid onto the wall of the threaded tube may also help reduce damage. <br>Drop me a pm if you want, I&#39;d love to lend a hand, have access to SEM, Sputtercoater, minisupercomputer, qPCR, Minion, Countess, flurometer, spectrophotometer, electrophoresis and a couple other gadgets. ;)

 I just thought of something, instead of trying to make it smart enough to perform complex tasks like a computer, why not see if you can use it to instead translate computer signals into signals that out brains can interpret as light and sound. Basically, have the neurons send a translated signal to our brain, allowing us to interact with a computer or anything of the like without a need for a mouse or keyboard, basically, being able to directly talk to the computer straight from your mind

 Fibre Marking Lasers can be used to vapour despot metals onto glass. You place the sheet of glass on top of a sheet of metal and then use the laser to mark the metal. The metal vaporises directly onto the glass above. This could potentially allow you to produce slides with a fraction of the effort. Check out &#39;Fibre Laser Learning Lab 17&#39; from SarbarMultimedia if you&#39;re interested. I was just watching this new discovery about fibre marking lasers and I thought it might help you out.

 I‚Äôve thought of an idea you could try to do. You could grow neurons connected to a computer like you did here, and then you could then create another experiment : we have machines capable of reading the brain waves of animals. We could try to send the brainwaves of an animal into another animal and viceversa so their brains could ‚Äúconnect‚Äù so to speak. <br>And finally you could connect the neurons connected to the computer to another brain, and this could be the very first steps into creating virtual simulations or a neural interface. Just an idea. There might be many things wrong with it but please tell me if this would be plausible.

 THIS IS OLD TECHNOLOGY AND OLD NEWS!<br>I‚Äôm from the year 2096 and we ditched that old neuron technology in the year 2068. I have only been here a few minutes and this is the first thing I see. In 2096 we now have telepathic powers that require no chips but a centralised Ai core we feed from. <br><br>This was all replaced by advanced virtual reality. BTW, since I still have a few minutes before I go back to my timeline, here are some predictions as most of your history was wiped out in 2054 by Ai. Let me know in the comments if I‚Äôm correct and will check when I revisit in 2028 <br><br>1. There will be a guy with a funny haircut as President of the USA (we call it ‚ÄúFederation Capital‚Äù in my time line <br><br>2. There will be some pandemics but one in particular will see a world economic collapse <br><br>3. Some black footballer named after an orange drink will kill his wife and lover and get away with it<br><br>4. There will be a lot of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù going around <br><br>5. There will be conflict over some primitive black liquid that you call oil and they will mask a war to cover up the real reason <br><br>6. One of American presidents will use a ‚Äúcigar <br>As sex toy and get in trouble <br><br>7. You will go from a VCR to CD technology quite fast<br><br>8. A guy who uses a piece of fruit as the company logo will change your technology <br><br>9. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE<br>The group responsible for creating AI technology and killing humanity are evil.<br>In my time line we call them lightmati and throughout history they have had names such as Sunati, Illuminati and Saturni. If any of these are talked about in your time line be careful and don‚Äôt listen to them <br><br>Ok must go now see you in 2028u

 Two part epoxy doesn&#39;t stick well to PP (polyethylene )and PE (polypropylene) plastics, because those polymers don&#39;t have functional groups that can covalently bound (they are just carbon and hydrogen). Try glass instead or other appropriate polymer.

 For receiving neural signals from brain cells first you have to give them some kind of signals like electrical signals  by pressing some voltages like little amount of voltages to the neurons. Then the neurones became active from their idle stage then you cannot use that kind of , I mean what is used to understand cockroaches neural signals . you have to have a special kind of device that can measure the slightly changes in electricity and can send some little signals alongside at the same time. And I think you can avoid the corrosion of the metal from the glass by using simple biological skin tissues. And the glass cannot be smooth like normal glass it has to be or minimum you have to use that kind of glass that&#39;s surface is not smooth . For your metal to stick on to the glass for a long time. Smooth surfaces cannot stick your metal on to them for a long time when you are using biological matters that are slippery like neurones. Please remember that.üòä<br><br>[Note: cockroaches are micro organisms and humans are sentian organisms their brain functions are not the same when other animals like cockroaches can only receive signals by little measures but to receive and send signal to human brain cells you have to do something different like something that can detect slightly changes of electrical changes and can send signal at the same time and receive at the same time to]

 Imagine a world where there amongst us is nothing but robots and cyborgs. Imagine there to not be a need for people to feed the system. Would  people need to work? With the world&#39;s governments ensue more control and power over the flesh of us all? imagine a group of people that have had a ancient hope an idea and a goal that they&#39;ve had for thousands of years and that there is people out there in this world including this man that has this channel that are endorsing their idea. An idea that through technology we can one day be like gods and be able to have magnificent powers and to be able to live on forever. Do you think all of humanity would be given this power? As of right now jobs are being taken every single day by another robot. What if one day they actually do find a way to put consciousness into a machine? Could this be an actual like Terminator movie where skynet would be literally be just the internet and all of these  robots decide to go against humanity or if humans program to wreck havock. I understand your channel and your interest but I also understand the agenda and the group of people in the idea behind this type of thinking and what it will lead to. I like many other people will never support any type of channel like this endorsing any type of manipulation of man through machinery just because we as a people that know a little bit of somethingwould like this to drag on as long as possible before as we know it this stuff will take place whether or not anyone likes it or notit technologies there it is possible and it&#39;s just before time before it actually is being shown as available to the public on a mass scale through several corporations

 if we can safely remove human neurons from IT people with the knowledge of computer language would the neurons carry some of that information over cutting the learning period in half.  For example if we take neurons from a pilot and make brain cheese from that to fly a plane would the neurons theoretically carry some of that information over from the original host body, or would the probability of the neurons we scoop out of the brain have that information be so minuscule and implausible?<br>Looking for a friend.

 this is fascinating and a part of me is really excited at the idea that we&#39;d be able to do this, but i really feel like we&#39;re getting into the &quot;just because we can doesn&#39;t mean we should&quot; territory. at what point would the brain cells be considered conscious? is it ethically right to create a conscious brain with no body, no way of communicating its wants and needs, and use it for a commercial purpose (like flying planes)?

 This poses an ethics problem, if you create sentience do you know it is sentient or is that how it leans to react? If you don‚Äôt know that than people could be fighting for the freedom of non-sentient beings or people would treat the free thinking thing as a simple AI but you wouldn‚Äôt keep a slave to control something like a plane. If you tried that than it could choose that it didn‚Äôt want to live anymore which could cause, if overused, total chaos. Also creating a living being alone without having any sensation would be a type of hell because if you put your brain in a jar without any sensation except for being able to think than you were forced to fly a plane you would want to die unless that was something you lived for. This is just what I believe but it obviously isn‚Äôt everything I feel but it is a baseline for true creation the living brain and not just a few cells.

 Nanoelectronics expert here! Do you have any way to check the thickness of your layers? if so, I recommend using a very very thin layer of titanium followed by a thicker layer of gold. Like, probably 10nm of ti followed by ~150 nm of gold. Also, I recommend using a heater for your substrate so you can slowly cool it and it anneals rather than cracking. Good luck!

 Oh this is neat. I did some student work on rat neurons back in 2009 at Reading University. <br><br>At the time we were looking into network behaviour of neurons and how memories were formed to get better understanding of conditions such as alzheimer&#39;s, parkinsons and epilepsy. <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-archive/press-releases/pr16530.html">https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-archive/press-releases/pr16530.html</a><br><br>The main disadvantages to using real neurons (or at the time research might have moved on in the last ten years) is that infections / contamination and gas mixtures were a total pain in the ass to keep from killing the cultures. There&#39;s no blood brain barrier and neurons are vunerable to a surprising number of things. We once lost 6 months of time because the neurons kept dying which we eventually traced to the VOC&#39;s outgassing from the paint of the new lab we had which got through our filters.<br><br>Second disadvantage is whilst the cells will connect two-dimensionally initially and make contact with the gold pads eventually the number of neurons increase and they preferentially become a three-dimensional ball structure which lifts up off the plate and prefers to communicate with itself. This means that communication between the neurons and computer decreases / ceases depending on the culture in question. We tried a number of things to keep the culture adhering to plate but at the time (2009) it was still an ongoing problem.<br><br>Third disadvantage is vibration, because you have a sheet of neurons on the plate with a liquid nutrient over the top you have a good liquid flow which is not something you get in the densely packed 3d brain. The liquid will contain ions which can trigger neuronal activations and when a vibration / waves / slosh occurs you can get a massive random firing event which sends the neuron network into chaos which is probably similar to a human brain being concussed?  You need to limit vibration if you want to connect it to a computer to control a robot which means leaving the neurons on a desk somewhere rather than mounting them onto a platform.<br><br>I&#39;m going to subscribe to this and am interested to see where you go with this.<br><br>Edit: third disadvantage

Notice how the structures can be strung about and hung by wires. Wires go through walls. Electrodes have interfaces. .. Maybe even try something like a little disc with raised sides, which will fit into a standard test tube. Use the wires to suspend / electrode / service / swap, etc ... That way you can just take it out.. just my 2c . cool project , best wishes

 Dude for head cheese 2 create a micro fluidic chip that feeds the brain cells and let them breathe much like in a human body by using blood or something that can replace it. <br><br>If you create a 3 layer micro fluidic chip with the electrode on top brain cells on the middle level and flowing blood or pseudo blood in the 3rd layer that way you could regulate the chemical secretions of the neurons, feed the neurons so they don‚Äôt die and provide oxygen.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2YDApNRK3g&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a> false. That&#39;s not what a sentient intelligence is. That&#39;s just intelligence. There&#39;s absolutely no scientific indication that the consciousness comes from intelligence, computing power, or understanding or awareness of the same. At worst is a byproduct of a very complex organic mater trying to stick together the best it can, including tricking the other cells into &quot;believing&quot; they are a part of sentient creature and that death is bad. At best, consciousness is not physical at all, and merely uses the nervous system of organic beings as a &quot;transmitter&quot; in order to affect the plane of existence which is not it&#39;s native. <br><br><br>Either way, or anywhere in between, it&#39;s not something that can be achieved or taught. It&#39;s the other way around, sentience is needed to be able to learn and attain.  <br><br><br>Otherwise a breathtaking visual journey through a complex biotechnological procedure, with a lot of ingenious tips, for which I for one am immensely grateful that you shared.

 The trouble with flesh and machine is not only the difficulty to connect the two, but making the  &quot;artificial flesh&quot; viable. Flesh rots and needs to regrow. The extra mechanics neded to do his would probably not be worth all the extra steps and engineering issues when all you are trying to do is pass impulses efficiently so the &quot;body&quot; works efficiently.

 I&#39;m thinking you should ditch the microscope slide form factor entirely and use a matrix of glass and gold wires formed into a cable and bonded with the epoxy (or, even glass, which I think would be possible with nickel alloy wires) and then then cut so the cross-section is the matrix array you are looking for and the contact pad is actually the end of the wire, then you can bring the other end out to a terminal block, then you could use ZIF socket or pogo connectors or whatever you want to connect it to the computer. In other words, this gets you around the whole uninsulated lead sand problems with durability of the sputtered film.

 Why use a slide and coat it? Why not use a PCB and etch? It‚Äôs cheaper, and properly printed PCB can be outsourced. You can use gold as well if you are having it printed outside. Don‚Äôt think PCB plastic should be reactive to neurones. You will bring down costs considerably (limiting it to cost of iPSC neurones and media). Thanks for sharing, though.

 I&#39;d like to know why gold is &quot;more bio-compatible so that it&#39;s safe to grow the neurons on the electrodes&quot; compared to silver. Silver isn&#39;t toxic or harmful to living organisms except for bacteria (due to its antibacterial properties). Silver can tarnish (and turn your skin green in the case of jewellery) when it reacts with oxygen, and gold - at least pure gold - doesn&#39;t, so perhaps that&#39;s a reason? Both are very electrically conductive, although silver is the most conductive metal so I can see why it was used for the circuitry.

 Kind of reminds me of a programmer hacking a piece of code ......they did not invent the code but like what the piece of code does so they hack it and try make it work in another way....It looks like science is an unoriginal programmer with hack jobs which are very inferior to the original....maybe training sperm cells with nanobots to actually make scientific calculations to select the right genes, and reproduce a super race might be the next thing they have planned....

Or an artificial human brain? Would that prove that consciousness is really just  a product of our brain neurons firing sending recieving and communicating signals with eachother and that is it and this has jow become a very ethical and moral thing to think over.

 Wow, cool to see that its possible to manage so well without overly prized lab equipment. For autoclaving you might wanna purchase some simple autoclave bags. PEI works nice but its toxic so it might be a good idea to wash the insides of the dishes once with sterile water. Doing a coating with laminin on top of PEI will make things even better. When thawing the cells make sure that it doesn&#39;t take more than 10 minutes, also exchange all of the initial culture medium on the next day.  The frozen cell stock probably contains DMSO which is also toxic in very low concentrations. As for the medium, 1:1 ratio of neurobasal and DMEM/F12 with N2 and B27 as supplements should do wonders. Too much antibiotics can be detrimental so check the concentrations.For me the cells (iPCS and hESC derived neurons) usually adhered to the bottom within 30 minutes and after adherence its ok to change. As for measurements, check that you are sampling minimum 12kHz and that you are amplifying enough. With MCS commercial  MEAs with 50 microm diam electrodes the signals (peak-to-peak amplitude) are in microvolt range. However, the electrode hugely affects the measurements. Oh, and  the falcon tube system was really nice idea, if you however can&#39;t solve the problems consider making small dishes from PDMS, in case you have some lying around.<br>good luck, have fun &lt;3

 The way neurons interact with each other on a regular basis and their capability of making new connections or just communication in abnormal states is something very a kin to the quantum realm. Were trying to make quantum computers where we can have 0 and 1 at the same time, theorizing pistons that are both up and down at the same time. Superposition is mirrored in the brain and the smartest AI will be from a quantum computer. This...skips some steps by using organic parts that already kinda do that. There is a reason why you have all this processing power running on just 20 watts that nothing we create mechanically can come even close to. This emerging or organic and metallic matter is very exciting..but ... we should be very cautious. Dont want to make an actual aware consciousness. Youd have to tweak the standards for life.

 Hey! Great video! I&#39;m a neuroscience PhD candidate and work with primary neurons a lot. I have some suggestions on the culture side of things which might improve the experiment to get some signal... <br><br>When I change the medium, usually do a half change at 24hrs (only changing 125ul of medium in your case), a half change at 48hrs after seeding and then a half change every 4 days until the end of the experiment. You could try this? If you change all of the medium it tends to make the neurons quite stressed. I think your media composition was good, its exactly what I use. <br><br>I also coat my glass slides with poly d lysine and laminin which always works well. <br><br>Also, you might want to leave the neurons until 14 days in vitro until trying a recording? It&#39;s been noted in a few papers that neurons aren&#39;t functionally mature until this time point in culture, so that could be why you didnt get much signal.<br><br>Really cool experiment! Great idea to reduce seeding density, and I loved the thrifty falcon tube idea. <br><br>Will watch for updates with interest!

 so are scientists working on implementing human computer connection hybrids? or more importantly, are we talking augmentations to intellect AND replacement of damaged brain tissue possibly saving the minds and lives of people injured or otherwise disabled due to brain abnormalities? <br>i assume new neurons would mean basically a complete wipe of the region of the brain theyre replacing, but itd still be preferrable to relearn how to &quot;see&quot; rathher than have your brain permanently damaged for whatever reason right?

 The electrodes can interact with the neuron through depolarization but how will you account for the lack of integration from the electrodes??? The electrodes have no receptors for glutamine and GABA? So In reality you will only be able to record and activate or hyper polarize those neurons, but you cant have cells connect to the electrodes. I don‚Äôt understand the goal here, are you going to use the neurons to see their electrical activity because the the electrodes can only truly affect your brain. And if you would want the brain to help fly the plane you would have to use the recordings from the electrode to convert those recordings to commands on a computer. Either way I understand how complicated it can be.

 Intresting that rat neurons can be trained to do complex tasks, I wonder what the exact difference between human and rat neurons is other then the mass and external stimuli that causes rats to not just fly planes naturally, with training and some kind of input interface with a rat brain. If theres a difference between the two types on orders of magnitude then maybe there could be other animals like bird brain cells with a predisposition to flying, or if not maybe training these cells to drive cars or be used in computers. Also I hope that one day stem cells could be used to heal wounds or regrow limbs especially if we have a process to revert cells back to building  block stem cells. It could help people with war injuries instead of making them robocop.

 About a year ago I started my Biology undergrad research project. I had experience working with growing motor neurons on a piece of fibrin hydrogel to study how do the cells respond to stiffness of the material they grown in (hypothesis is their axon projections grows fast in stiff material and form connections more in soft material, but the data showed no trend). So I had some experience working on neurons grown on engineered materials.<br><br><br>This is such a cool field and the potential is enormous! I watched a bunch of your videos about microfluidics and putting metal patterns on stuff, and I have a bunch of ideas! I wish you posted this a year earlier and I think I could have gotten a lot of inspirations from it. Anyways, this is one of the best science videos I have seen in a while. Keep up the good work!!!

 If you can, see if you can have prethought into the following.  Think about creating a 3d latice configuration rather than 2d.  Cube connectors then coming from 6 faces.  Force the neurons to grow on these latice shapes by using electro-condcutivity.  Then program a base 27 system (x*y*z).  The computational power would be so much faster than the current base 2 of binary.

You can do that by pressing down with the round end of a screw driver handle or using a solvent.

 Building a computer using organic material, yes. Making an <b>AI</b> from organic material will always be inferior to a purely synthetic AI. Organics have to be taught and cannot be programmed. Organics are unstable, illogical and irrational, a meatbag hooked up to a machine is more likely to betray you and fill your lungs with deadly neurotoxin than a synthetic ever would. Using human neurons could result in delusions regarding it&#39;s identity. You&#39;re safer using a synthetic AI, and connecting it to all your defence systems and production lines is a fantastic idea with no possible ramifications. Not like there would be if you were to use a meatbag AI. 

 	Replies: I see where you come from, but that irrationality would also be due to a variety of neurotransmitters &amp; hormones, which are triggered by such &amp; such stimuli from such &amp; such organs. As far as I know (since I&#39;m an armchair fuckwad), if these factors are removed/changed, it&#39;s possible to narrow this irrationality.

 Love how ambitious your project is. I&#39;m glad that you went into it with an open mind and actually did your research. I honestly never expected to see a lot of the neurobiology you presented going into this and expected it to be just someone trying to grow neurons in a petrie dish. <br><br>With having a biologist on hand I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already thought of much of this, but a little advice from someone who studies in the field might help :). So, I would suggest looking at what growth factors you are applying and at what times you are applying them. As you mentioned, neurons are very sensitive. Their processes of synaptogenesis and myelination are highly dependant on the growth factors present.  Look into a lot of the research that has been conducted more recently on spinal cord injury for instance. Its a fairly similar concept you are trying to apply here. For example, the growth factor FGF2 is inhibitory of myelination, which means that if FGF2 is highly expressed in a region you are unlikely to have  any substantial transmission of signal. FGF2 is necessary however, as it recruits precursor oligodendrocytes to the location, which are actually responsible for creating the myelin on the neurons. This article talks a little about the mechanisms of this. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11922145">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11922145</a> <br><br>Another thing to consider is the potential pros and cons of using human neurons vs rat neurons and especially what the extra cellular environment mimics. This is more relevant to spinal cord injury repair, but for example, implanting the neurons of a human in a rat spinal cord lesion is actually better than implanting rat neurons. It is suggested that this is due to the presence of growth inhibitory factors present in that rat that will affect rat neurons but not human neurons. A lot of this is pretty cutting edge research so you&#39;ll definitely need to try and stay updated with current research in the field to maximise your chances of creating a working interface between the computer and the neurons. I&#39;m not really familiar with the technological side of the procedure, but there is a procedure you might be interested in called Epidural Electrical Stimulation. In essence, they implant electrodes into a patient with a complete spinal cord lesion (which means that nothing below the site of damage works), and stimulate their muscles. They then train the patients to use their bodies own electrical activity to cause contraction of their muscles. The training takes about 40 weeks. But they have actually managed to get functional recovery! Not 100% sure if its relevant to your rig, but it&#39;s awesome nonetheless and might give you some insights or change your perspective on something that I don&#39;t see. <br><br>Best of luck and I hope to see so much more to your research. If you find something, make sure you publish it! That way we can all trust the research and use it to hopefully further other research.

 The question, &quot;why settle for the synthetic version?&quot; Simple. A cell is complex, and in its tiny size, it has a lot going on it it not intended for computation. Also there is a lot of space between brain cells where they connect to one another. Now, imagine if all of that area was filled with micron semi conductors, even some of the new carbon based ones being worked on today, that are all geared towards one goal, computation of data. We may end up with something that maybe several thousand times more complex than the human brain, and all of it programmable to think for you.<br><br><br>Yes, why indeed settle for the synthetic version, when you can have something that was made to do just what you made it to do, rather than it do what nature though evolution made it to do.

 I&#39;m not an expert at this, but I think you would need some kind of a traveling wave to get signals like those from a cockroach leg. A nerve in such a leg would have multiple very long axons, and they activate in a chain. With a mass of cells like this I would expect more something like an EEG, where individual action potentials can&#39;t be differentiated, but they would form waves with a certain spectrum.

Next time, go straight silver as, while not exactly biocompatible, it is not toxic; or use titanium for the second layer as it is extremely biocompatible. <br><br>Now ask me how many more times I can fit the word &#39;biocompatible in this response. LoL

 The issue I have with neuroscience is the fact that &quot;brain&quot; is consistently and routinely conflated with &quot;mind&quot;.  One can treat this criticism in a partizan or tribal manner but to do so then nothing of potential value would be garnered.  There is no conclusive functional connection between mind and brain, in fact, under detailed examination the converse is true.  Mind and brain are directed by their respective unique existential imperatives.  The latter is a crude instrument which concerns itself with survival and reproduction whereas the former with seeking elevated cognitive evolution.  This is a critically important distinction because it can model brain beyond anthropological descriptions and the associated limitations.  Taking this approach also permits insight into So-called &quot;AI&quot; beyond the &quot;Event Horizon of the Technological Singularity&quot; of which no current modelling exists within the entirety of the global scientific or academic communities.

 Here&#39;s an easy and amazing way to clean your slides prior to coating. You have a vacuum chamber for sputtering, just use plasma cleaning on the slides before coating. Adding some valving to your argon input, bending a Faraday cage around your jar, and funnelling a microwave magnetron into that Faraday cage, it should be pretty easy to add many different cleaning gasses that are turned to plasma from the microwave radiation that will easily clean almost any contamination and the valving will allow you to jump straight to sputtering without ever exposing the freshly cleaned slide to even the atmosphere, let alone any other contaminants.

 When laying down the tubes with the epoxy coating, I have the impression you should drop it with a twisting motion to ensure that the epoxy gets good adhesion.

 I don&#39;t want to sound like someone from the dark age, but I bet some people will have ethical problems with this kind of experiments.<br>I mean ya surely neurons can do complex calculations quicker than any chip, but how do they work ?<br>You didn&#39;t mention that. All we know is if they connect with each other and to the metal then we&#39;ll get results. But to be able to truly control it, you have to know how it works. And if it is ok to make them work for us. these are living cells so I can call them &quot;they&quot;.<br>If it was an experiment to implement chips that can cure spinal cord damage, then I&#39;m all down with these kind of experiments integrating living cells with machines. But take parts of brain and connect them to a circuit then &quot;teaching them&quot; as you said. Something doesn&#39;t sound right.<br>I don&#39;t know how that can serve humans. I know you said more than once &quot;teach them to fly a plane&quot;, but we don&#39;t need that. the ethical problems greatly outweighs the benefit. It&#39;s just for luxury which we can achieve by other means. there are computers now that are doing this. I know it&#39;s not the same, but man we are worried that AI might develop conscious. Do we really need to talk about neurons ?

 You could make a silk tissue scaffold using rope core memory techniques to grow the neurons into preset patterns connected to a computer.  Then you could grow the scaffold into a primitive life support system like a salp. Feeding the salp-like tissue keeps the neurons healthy and you can use a nutrient drip without the silk degrading.  I wouldn&#39;t use primate cells for this though... try cephalopods.

 I&#39;ve watched this several times. It&#39;s driving me crazy.  I&#39;m a hobby electronics enthusiasts.  You need to get kicad or eagle. They&#39;re free pcb software.   Most Chinese distributors can produce a pcb that will fit all of your specs at a reasonable price.  Then you can get 100s of connection points.  Also at the voltage the cells are working the design you have is probably too noisy.   So cool that this type of experiment can be done almost at the garage level.

 Cognitive neuro psychology says &quot;We don&#39;t see with our eyeballs&quot;; we transmit light signals to our visual cortex like a camera sensor. So if we can train neurons to take input from a camera sensor, interpret it, and display it to a screen, we could see what it &quot;sees&quot;. Similar to how an oyster or worm sees fuzzy light sources. Add enough complex processing, and we start getting into the &#39;Brain in a Jar&#39;, simulation theory of life. I.e. How do we know we aren&#39;t just brains in a jar in a simulation...? <br>@Paul Putter Ghost in the Shell indeed

 Wait a second, what is the Falcon tube made from? YOU CAN NOT GLUE POLYPROPYLENE AND POLYETHYLENE. Not with epoxy, with any epoxy. Pretty much nothing bonds to these two families of plastics. And this is what your tubes look like. If polycarbonate is suitable for your process, please consider using that, as you&#39;ll actually be able to epoxy onto that.<br><br>Epoxy bonds really really well to glass in general, so chances are, your leak was not it debonding from glass, but from the tube. Also to be kept in mind: 1:1 mix epoxy is weird. Most of the hardener component is not actually the hardener, but... some kind of gunk, a plastifier that incidentally causes it to weaken a terrible lot when heated. Reducing the amount of hardener and curing it heated up can help make it more temperature resilient (you reduce the amount of plastifier that way, but the crosslinking will be a bit hesitant to kick off without some thermal encouragement), or you find a new epoxy which doesn&#39;t turn into goo when heated, and chances are, it&#39;s not going to be a 1:1 by volume mix.

 Not an expert on biology, but seems that the cracks are from gold corrosion (I guess that your media is high in chlorine). Lots of experimentalists assume that gold is innert, but under acidic environments and halogen salts, gold will be dissolved into tetrachloro aureate ions. (Check this Pourbaix diagram for instance: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom_Mortier/publication/28359893/figure/fig6/AS:669459815604244@1536623066252/Simplified-Pourbaix-diagram-for-the-system-gold-water-Cl-at-25C.png)">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom_Mortier/publication/28359893/figure/fig6/AS:669459815604244@1536623066252/Simplified-Pourbaix-diagram-for-the-system-gold-water-Cl-at-25C.png)</a><br><br><br>Within your cells, you have a microenvironment different that the electrolyte, my guess is that this  leads to your electrodes work as both cathode and anode. You could attack this by polarizing your electrodes at 0 volts vs a reference (a voltage that will allow your electrode to be inmune to corrosion, while not promoting Hydrogen Evolution, which leads to alkanization).

 Instead of the epoxy mixture you could use some medical UV adhesives from Loctite. They&#39;re very easy to handle and require just a few seconds of some strong UV exposure to harden. We use them in our company to glue cannulas into hoses for insulin pump occlusion tests (at fairly high pressures). I&#39;m also not sure, if you really need to do the electrode coating on a glass substrate, if you just could use some FR4 PCB with gold platet pads. Seal up everything except the pads with the UV glue and you should be fine. But maybe I&#39;m wrong and it&#39;s not that simple i guess. Nice work!

 i would say a good question to ask here is whenever we would consider this moral. we don&#39;t know how we are conscious. how we can realize our own existence. perhaps it is created by neurons. if this project gets advanced enough, and a consciousness is created from it, the experimentation here could easily become the equivalent of human experimentation. (more specifically, the kind that is outlawed)

 Just a (hopefully) useful tip: to etch glass it would be better to use a diluted solution of NaOH. If you submerge the glass into it and heat, it will etch nicely, even to the point of turning the glass frosted, depending on the concentration.<br><br>This way you don&#39;t have to deal with concentrated sulfuric acid/ oxygen peroxide, just needing to neutralize the base to a neutral pH. Just be careful that heated sodium hydroxide is in itself a way more corrosive substance than acids. Hope this help.

 Super impressive!  So amazed how you started by making the sputterer and made it all the way through culturing neurons. Wow, wow, wow.<br>Hopefully helpful comments: <br>The signals will be much bigger (1000x) if you insulate all but the tips of the electrodes as you mentioned.  Otherwise the signal is averaged out across the entire conductive surface.  <br>The DC voltage you measured is due to the battery formed by the silver, gold, and electrolyte solution.

 Neurons described as little creatures is amusing. Although each cell is an individual even when part of a multicellular organism, I just never thought of an cell as a creature. I guess it&#39;s the presumed lack of sentience. For example, a cell has no pre-frontal lobe. Although it takes Neurons to make one, what a conundrum.

 This is very much related to the &quot;brain in a jar&quot; conundrum..<br>If this were to scale up enough in the future, how would we be sure that the monstrosities we create are not actually self-aware, while doing our computation for us? Essentially &quot;screaming&quot; on the inside, unable to communicate their awareness.<br>Think about this, a brain in a jar, sustained with nutrients, oxygen and all else that is required to keep it alive. Now, if its a human brain, we &quot;know&quot; that its a person in there, aware and thinking. But if it has no way to communicate that to the outside world, no eyes, no voice, no hands, how would anyone else know that it was actually self-aware?<br>Just seeing electrical activity within the fleshy mass wouldnt be enough to conclude if its sentient or not, it might as well just be chemical reactions to outside / input stimuli, like any muscle reflex or automated response. Only the brain itself truly knows if its aware and thinking or not.<br><br>This philosophical problem actually extends to other human beings as well, everyone that aren&#39;t &quot;you&quot;.<br>How do you <b>know</b> for a <b>fact</b> that other human beings have the same self-aware &quot;real&quot; sentience that you have? You dont, you can never &quot;know&quot; that for a fact. You can only assume, and wish that is the case. You can only take your own sentient experience as a human being, and extrapolate that to assume that other human beings must have the same level of awareness, rather than just being automatons reacting to input stimuli and generating predictable response outputs, like a machine.<br><br>So how do we know for a fact, that 100 years from now, with a whole brain-sized neural network (LITERALLY with human neurons) operate machinery for us, that it is not also self-aware and screaming on the inside, alone in its own thoughts?<br>We can&#39;t know that. We could analyze the electrical activity inside, like we could with the brain in a jar, but we couldnt know if it was merely how it operated, or if it was due to self-awareness.<br><br>This confusion even extends to nuts and bolts self-learning AI &quot;neural&quot; networks now. The resulting code from a learning session of AlphaGo for example, is indecipherable to a human being. We have no clue what each &quot;node&quot; means, or what each connection between the nodes actually represent in terms of which moves to make under which game circumstance, we only know that information passing between the nodes, in a certain pattern, results in an AI that wins the game.<br>We have no idea what the patterns and neurons actually &quot;do&quot;, just that it results in the desired outcome.<br><br>Now i&#39;m not saying AlphaGo is sentient, hidden in its neural network code.<br>I&#39;m merely saying, if we extrapolate this to ACTUAL human physical neurons....<br>We may be treading in extremely creepy muddy moral waters here... We cannot be sure these things dont become self-aware, and in suffering. This is some Warhammer 40k shit about to go down..

 if you could work with ordering a prototype pcb for a few bucks idk about autoclave temp or reactivity of fiberglass material with your projects but you could have 2 layers with through holes to your cell probe points and have a much higher resolution or more probe dots i mean. other then that to do it the glass you could plate the glass with the splatter then do subtractive etching where you print you circuit onto transfer paper, then with a clothes iron or laminator transfer it onto the plated piece wash paper away then put into acid, there is also a UV exposure method that apparently has finer detail and success rate but never done that myself<br>.

 I&#39;m so down with this fascinating idea. Seems like there might be many potential paths for this research to explore. The obvious is a neurolink style computer interface, but after that&#39;s working how about studying the effects T.H.C, Psilocybin, or L.S.D? It would be very interesting to try and understand how these substances might affect such an interface. From there it might lead to new psychedelic art forms or I don&#39;t know, maybe a new angle of thought when considering how these hallucinogens work in the human brain. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many more. However it turns out I think it&#39;s off to a promising start.

 Neurons need glia to recycle and replenish neurotransmitters and extracellular molecules. And glia need access to the bloodstream. <br>Neurons react to extra cellular input @ dendrites or cell bodies, for them to activate on their own (tonically active) you need a good circulating mixture of various molecules. They don&#39;t take elections as input, but a negative input pulse could attract some calcium, and some potassium and sodium which might help the neuron depolarize and send a signal that might eventually chain over to another electrode as an output, where the release of potassium and sodium or charged neurotransmitters could register a voltage.  The election pads would be both input and output. Seems very interesting, but might be best to use a animal brain that has all the infrastructure setup for you, and you just need to pump oxygenated blood through it

 Question: 1. How would the neural cells induce potential into the electrodes? I ask this because don&#39;t they use neurotransmitters to induce impulses from one to the next? Neurotransmitters don&#39;t carry current. They just send a signal to the next neuron to depolarize( or inhibit ).<br>2. If there is some kind of answer to 1 then would the resistance be low enough in those electrodes for those tiny cells to work with?<br><br><br>I&#39;m no expert here, just putting that out there. Als, I&#39;m too lazy to go read the rat publication thing to see how they did it so I&#39;ll just wait for someone to answer.

 1. You might need a positive control. 2. You might want to verify neurons alone (instead of oligo-neuron co-culture) is sufficient to produce and process the signal. 3. You electrode degrades even in the media, the glued area might be broken as well. 4. In order to make your neurons learn,  more complicated environment than a 2D cell culture might be needed(3D cell cultures are actually available); special architecture might be necessary to make the signal meaningful.

 I think you&#39;ll do fine just by adding the terminals to the very edge of the dish. The neurons on the sides of the solution will communicate, while the rest of the dish should serve as the computational center. They might grow their own pathways there.<br><br>And you can do without all the flimsy metallizing process, by just sticking thin gold wires right under the side of your dish as you glue it on. OR even better, just ditch the glass completely and use heat to stab with the wire through the dish (it will be difficult with thin gold though, I guarantee it). That should give you the ability to build the ultimate braindish.<br><br>Then a little pipeline, oxygenator and a pump to gently circulate the feeding solution. And I think you maybe should connect that thing to a computer right away. The neurons i think need to learn so I think they&#39;ll fire properly only if you give them reason to. You can play&#39;em some jazz to kick up the spirit :D. You could even put a chemical dispenser in there that will drop something noice for the neurons whenever they do something you want them to.

 	Replies: Well, long finned pilot whales have almost twice as many neurons as us and I don&#39;t see them doing calculus, so even a trillion in a poorly optimised configuration wouldn&#39;t be particularly impressive, but if ordered properly it would be likely that such a brain would be around 10-100x as powerful as a similarly organised human brain, due to having 1000x the volume, 100x the surface area, and 10x the distance for the signal to travel (Approximately). It would however consume immense amounts of nutrients, energy (20,000% daily human intake) and oxygen (same increase as energy), though you could improve the oxygen requirement by using ketosis instead of glycolysis for energy supply (not quite as necessary in humans, but still quite efficient). It would be undesirable until it could be sustained at post scarcity levels.

 Is it possible that since you provided no stimulus or feedback to the electrodes, the neurons had no reason to generate a signal of any kind?  Even in the womb or egg, the brain receives sound, light, and movement stimuli and in the womb there is enough room to allow for motor responses.

 Ever thought about using graphene? It has a good bio-compatibility and superior electrical conductivity. You can coat glass really easily. Graphene likes to self assemble. The easiest method is dipping the corner of a glass slide into a suspension of graphene and it will slowly coat the entire surface. - You could potential mask off the bits you don&#39;t want coated, creating a conductive array.

 I&#39;m curious to see how the iPSC neurons are going to turn out. Personally I think that 10 years has come and gone after Yamanaka and we haven&#39;t seen nearly as much as was promised, and there is still a lot more that needs to be done for usefull reprogramming. As someone who has worked with iPS cells they are in general a royal pain in the ass to work with, and what I worry about with this project is that they don&#39;t really have a concrete identity and tend to misbehave.

7353: wazscience 
 though i havnt worked with neurons, i did do a research project where i cultured cardiomyocytes for confocal microscopy, and I think i might be able to share some experience that might help you. From what I have seen in your video, you guys are walking the right direction, even though you were stumbling along the way. first thing i want to mention is about your sterilization procedure. on top of the heats effect on the container you choose, we have to consider the its effect on the epoxy as well. since heat causes air to expand, any bubbles in epoxy can expand and destroy your seal, so either make sure there are no air bubbles or use a different adhesive. Also, as you&#39;ve already seen, you should consider using a metal container with a rack to hold the slides. On top of that,  you should also use autoclave tape. This tape acts as a visual indicator for sterilization, and lets you know sterilization conditions have been reached. Next i want to talk about plating the cells on to your custom slides. It is reasonable to be concerned about how much of your culture will survive being plated, but having too many cells is an even bigger problem. The crowding not only prevents proper development of the cells, it can also deplete the nutrients from the medium much faster. Before plating on to your custom slides, it would have been better for you to have a kind of trial run by plating at different concentration of cells on to &quot;blank&quot; slides. This lets you see what concentrations would work best without wasting your custom slides. I dont know what concentration of cells would work best for neurons, so maybe look up papers and see what concentrations were used in other peoples experiments, and adapt them for yourself.  One thing you should add to your procedure is a wash procedure. With all the cells looking almost the same, and being crowded as they are, its hard to pick out the healthy vs dead cells. As much as you want to pack cells on to your slide, it is better to have fewer, but healthy, cells. For your wash procedure, simply rinse the cells with your culture media a couple of times, if you dont mind sparing some, and using different tips with every wash cycle.  For imaging your neurons, you can use florescence microscopy. Here, you use florescent proteins to label parts of the cell, but you already knew that. There are 2 ways to do that. one way is to insert a gene with a florescent tag. This method is a bit more expensive, but it does allow you to do your experiment and image you cells. The other method, which is what I used to do, is to use florescent tagged antibodies. Here, you have antibodies that will target and bind to whatever target you choose. this method is a bit cheaper then the first method, but it requires you to sacrifice one of your slides, and requires a separate procedure to prepare the slide for imaging.  This is all that i can think of right now. If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know.

 Do you have any publications? I&#39;m very interested in your work. I do research on proteins specifically related to Calmodulin and CaMKII -- which are related to dendritic spine growth and neuronal plasticity. Your model is impressive, but missing some aspects which might account for your lack of response. In order to generate a voltage potential, you need signaling cascades and differential ion concentrations between the inside and outside of the cells. Assuming there are sodium/potassium/etc ion channels on the cells, you need to first stimulate them using a high frequency electric field. Check out some of the work of Dr. Neal Waxham (one of my collaborators) on Ca ion signaling frequency dependency.

 You should provide an input signal from the beginning. An ordinary sine wave with a frequency of several Hz for one or two inputs should be sufficient. And I would create connections between the remaining electrodes so that they would have some meaning for neurons, so there would be something to measure.<br>Oscilloscope measurement is unlikely to succes, you need an amplifier with very high input impedance (which is probably a device from &quot;Backyard Brains&quot;).<br>And the voltage you see, you probably made a simple battery cell. :) (various metals and some liquids as electrolyte :))

 brains really are amazing pieces of hardware are they not? the ability to store information while computing and simultaneously growing - I wonder if adding different types of nerve cells into the mix could make it more efficient for example adding the cells responsible for muscle contraction to the electrodes while spreading the other end out with the brain cells could potentially reduce the amount of electrodes needed to complete this project (the downside being you couldn&#39;t fire more than one signal at a time towards any given electrode) - I wish I had the money and time to do these things.

 I&#39;m a little temporally removed from my undergrad degree, but iirc, ensuring the axon growth cone ends up on the electrodes is going to be key.<br>And somehow either inter-cellular communication, which may be hard without additional cell lines since signals typically travel across cortical layers, or get individual neurons to grow the distance of the electrodes.<br>And, activating the action potential too, damn this is gonna be tough.

 Dude you made a video of a failed attempt just to get likes ??? plus you also have silver and on top of that you have coated gold, the voltage you are seeing is because your fluid cell is behaving like a voltaic cell. Both, Silver and copper are important component of voltaic cells, if you want to really really measure electrical response from the cells then you must not use reactive metals like silver or copper to culture cells. The cell culture media works as a very good electrolyte because it has large number of ions to conduct electricity. I am little amazed that your friends with whom you are collaborating also didn&#39;t noticed it. I guess they are doing PhD or Postdoc. There are lot of other parameters that you might have to take into account, that why research groups are building intricate patterns to get some electrical response from cells.

 Use UV/ozone as a final cleaning stage before thin film deposition. It has all the advantages of other oxidizing cleans, but since it isn&#39;t wet it&#39;s good for dealing with the residue of your wet clean, and it&#39;s relatively easy to implement for skilled DIY. Or if you can tolerate metal contaminants and just want to get rid of hydrocarbons you can wipe with acetone and go straight to UV/ozone. The best implementation has an ozone-destroying lamp (254nm but not 185nm) to go with the ozone-producing lamp since ozone is toxic and a pain to deal with. For such small microscope slides you don&#39;t need the high-dollar lamps in professional units; any ozone-producing Hg-vapor lamp in an enclosed space to build up some ozone will do.<br><br><br>This scheme is full of hazards including but not limited to ozone and shortwave UV.

 I would imagine someone of you intellect would have considered that etching the slides prior to the plating process would roughen the surface as well as provide a larger, recessed surface area. Which in turn could increase you success rate in reducing the de-lamination of the electrodes for this particular application. Was this a consideration at an early stage, and was eliminated prior to prototyping? Also it may be possible to use threaded Surgical Steel tubes the appropriate diameter required for the autoclave tube caps with a silicone gasket between the slides and tube, and be held in place with neodymium magnetic washer from below the slide. Theoretically this may provide more of a mechanical connection, used in conjunction with the Adhesive being applied to the exterior of the tubes still allowing light to pass through.<br>The assembly would have to be post autoclave in a sterile environment to avoid damaging the magnets and contamination.<br><br>I look forward to future videos, this subject in particular intrigues me greatly. I have a theory based on precisely the material in this video regarding the possibility of a  bio computer for advanced robotics constructing it&#39;s own frame work and specified functionality  by stimulation of extremely mild and precise electrical frequencies. These elements of neuron scaffolds could then be combined like assembling a computer and then trained to execute a given objective. Thank you for your content!

 I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve looked into it, but surface treatment plays a huge role in how well epoxy works Smooth surfaces like glass will fail easily. It is good practice to rough up surfaces in order to help the bond. Another thing to consider is the bonding ability of metals. Not all metals can connect to others and sometimes you need to use multiple metals to get to your endpoints.

 When you put your electrodes down, put a bridge between the big outer pads, so they are all electrically connected. Deposit on your base material, peel your mask, and then you can use &#39;simple&#39; electrocheemistry to plate your desired materials on top of the base layer. Once youre happy with what you have, you can grind/cut off the bridge wires so all the contacts are now isolated.  PCB manufacturing does something similar to plate hard gold onto card-edge connector gold fingers.. They are all connected together, so that they can be electroplated, and then the final routing and beveling of the PCB cuts away the traces which connected all the fingers together.  All you&#39;d need is a barely conductive layer, and you can plate up  and improve it from there.

 Piranha should work to clean the slides but I often clean glass slides for sputtering or evaporation using RCA 1 solution. It&#39;s 5:1:1 mixture of water, Ammonium hydroxide, and 30% H2O2. You heat to 60-70C so that the H2O2 is reactive but not quickly and spontaneously decomposing. Soak the slides in the solution for 10 minutes then rinse with DI water.

 I&#39;m simply amazed. I didn&#39;t even realize that this stuff was already possible. <br>For a few years, I&#39;ve been thinking about the actual morality of growing an entire human brain. It could open up so many doors for technology, but what would that brain think if it was given enough input for it to understand that it exists, and it then decides that it doesn&#39;t want to be a computing slave? But perhaps if you only use cerebral neurons, it would only be a processor, and wouldn&#39;t feel any desire to be free? So many questions...

 Hey my dude. If you have trouble with the electrodes you should rough up the glass first(acid leaves dimples for surface area, but sandpaper will leave grooves that the metal can grip into and sometimes under like engraving inlays). Right now it&#39;s just holding on to a smooth surface and will undoubtedly have imperfections in the bind. If you take a very fine sand paper you should be able to get them to hold on better, think like the gecko tape and the gecko feet. Afterwards try finding a clear lab culture safe coating that will contract as it dries (further aiding grip with tension to hold it further) that you can apply to the areas that don&#39;t have contact with the cells to reduce the failure points.<br>Epoxy doesn&#39;t always contract enough to really give you the desired tension.<br>Edit: to add specifications. I do hobby work with plating polishing and engraving often having to change textures to make sure things stay. Like inlaying metal to wood or coating a leaf in metal.

 Hey, it may be worth looking into possible differences between measuring neurons directly and via surface EMG. The signal that is amplified in sEMG is the result of muscle fibers reacting to an initial neuronal signal, and is somewhere between 0-10 mV of potential between the two electrodes. If you are getting 120 mV then you could easily be saturating the AD623 Instrumentation Amplifier at the circuit&#39;s start and may need to adjust the gain setting resister accordingly (resistor R6 in the schematic at &quot;<a href="https://backyardbrains.com/products/files/SpikerBox.v.1.3c.Annotated.Schematics.pdf%22)">https://backyardbrains.com/products/files/SpikerBox.v.1.3c.Annotated.Schematics.pdf&quot;)</a>, although I&#39;m not sure what potential should be expected from this case. It may very well just be a materials used thing causing the potential. Also just as a heads up it may be worth trying to make everything as concrete as possible with regards to the input wires. In the video you had your fingers on the probes, and while I&#39;m not certain how much of an effect it would create, the added capacitance and less equal input impedances could be obscuring the results. Same goes with the conductive tape like someone mentioned below.<br>    I spent a few months trying to design an instrumentation amplifier out of some LM358-N op-amps for use in a sEMG but the sheer amount of things that affect In-Amps is painful. Although if you get stuck / ever want to go down the <del>hell</del> rabbit hole, &quot;A Designer‚Äôs Guide to Instrumentation Amplifiers, 3rd Edition&quot; was extremely helpful for me since it covers a lot of common issues. This is a pdf of it ( <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/designers-guide-instrument-amps-complete.pdf">https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/designers-guide-instrument-amps-complete.pdf</a> ) but it should show up immediately on google aswell.<br>    Overall I love your videos and have found inspiration for many of my projects from them. I currently am finishing up the details on my vacuum chamber setup and am trying to see about using gasses originating from electrolysis for reactive sputtering. Good luck and I can&#39;t wait to see where this ends up going!

 To improve the circuit definition you can try to modify an ink printer and print with it several successive layers, coat with metals and wipe the ink with acetone.<br>It&#39;s used in the DIY electronics community to make custom PCB and you can achieve pretty good definition with a good enough printer.

 To measure neuron signals you need a pre-amplifier with GIGAOHM input impedance and 10^6 voltage gain, because these signals are only a few microvolts and can deliver maximum currents of a few nanoamps. Measuring directly with an oscilloscope is practically useless. In electronic engineering we also sometimes study these stupid things (hilarious).<br>PS: an amp like that, could cost more than the neurons you bought, lol.

 Create a feedback loop editable by the brain and wait for emergent intelligence. English: Connect a camera to it with the ability to turn left or right. Wait a few years/hours and if you come back and the camera follows things that move its probably alive.<br><br><br>A human brain has about 7 billion &quot;brain cells&quot; and a mouse has 75 million, while this is certainly alive it might not be sentient or even feel pain and because it was not receiving any data, imagine a human being the very first moment they were born would it think if it had nothing to think about? deprive it of sound, touch, sight, hunger, etc and it might not &quot;switch on&quot; The same way if a computer doesn&#39;t do anything if you don&#39;t switch the power on. STOP READING HERE IF YOU WANT.<br><br><br>A good explanation would be imagine a neural net: it constantly evolves using a point system, if you reach the goal get one point. It randomly changes thousands of versions of itself a second and destroys the ones with the least points and the ones with the most have thousands of edited copies made of them and it continues until eventually it can complete that task 100% of the time. What if you created a neural net but didn&#39;t give it a goal? It wouldn&#39;t do anything much like how those neurons aren&#39;t receiving any information, it is also possible that zapping them with electricity woke them up and they invented fusion reactors and solved the answer to the universe and everything moments before he threw them in the garbage compacter.

 you may try looking for old eeg/ecg equipment on ebay or something. If you decide to build your own amplifier, you&#39;ll probably need an instrumentation amplifier.

There are also specialized chips for eeg applications, and they include built-in ADC, but you&#39;ll need a microcontroller to connect them because they most likely use SPI (but don&#39;t quote me on this)

 Instead of using the vinyl in the first step you should coat the entire glass and than use uv cured paint and a stencil to make the pattern and than use acid etching to remove the coating leaving a pattern, like PCBs are made. That way you can have a better resolution.

 Great work.  Sorry for the &quot;help&quot; but I&#39;ve wanted to do this for a long time. I would use a bed of nails to connect to the slide. I&#39;m sure that wasn&#39;t handy at the time.   One paper I read that did this used PTFE film as a cover.  The diffusion rate kept the O2 and CO2 partial pressures correct.  Maybe your filter is the same or better.  It didn&#39;t sound like your cells were a mix.  You might want to consider growing a layer of glial cells before adding the neurons.  This could reduce the complexity of the media.  Consider a slow electrical pulse on one of the electrodes to make them feel at home.  Maybe 13Hz.

 So, what are you going to use to accurately stimulate and measure activity from the  neurons? I looked at the schematic for the backyard brain circuit and it&#39;s just a collection of amplifiers and a low pass filter. If you recreated the circuit on a PCB and added a ADC, and micro controller with usb (Or serial to USB converter) you could perfectly record all the voltages coming from the pads digitally on a computer and visualize the outputs. You could than add precision DACs, a few op amps, and analog switching IC than use  the pads for either stimulating or  sensing and you could switch each pad between the two during an experiment. With the low cost of PCBs from china this wouldnt be too pricey either. <br><br>Also, to cover the metal you dont want to be a pad, could you in theory use soldermask? Once you cure it with UV I think it&#39;s pretty inert but I&#39;m not basing that off anything at all.

 Another option for increasing the surface energy of the glass, and getting stuff to stick to it, is plasma cleaning. Basically how it works is you take some inert gas and or some gaseous oxygen, turn it into plasma I think through some kind of electrical process, and flow it over the surface you are cleaning. It is usually done in vacuum, but they also have handheld plasma guns that can be used for the same thing. I&#39;ve used it at work before, and the bond strength increase is dramatic, for all types of bonds. With an oxygen plasma, it actually etches the surface slightly, maybe a few layers of molecules, in addition to removing any water or hydrocarbons. It does nothing to remove particulate matter, however, so you should clean the surfaces you care about before cleaning, just to remove any dust or other small particles. It should prove superior to the piranha clean for your purposes, since the piranha will only remove so much stuff, and will inevitably leave stuff behind, even in the best circumstances.

 I work with iPSC neurons and have a couple of tips to consider. You definitely have 5-10x the density you want, dilute those neurons down and you&#39;ll get much healthier looking cells by day 2 and 3. Based of your images, I didn&#39;t see the growth of any neurites which suggests an unhealthy culture. This could be due in part to the high density but you might also research what supplements you are adding to your MM. Lastly, synapses tend not to form in vitro until about DIV 10 and spontaneous firing occurs shortly after. You&#39;ll need a healthy culture that can survive that long in order to get good recordings. Good luck, looking forward to see how it turns out! 

 	Replies: Ok awesome thanks for the tips! Thats pretty much along the lines we&#39;ve been thinking.  More grow time, less neurons. Good to know the exact timing though. 12 days was about what we&#39;d hoped for initially. We only measured when we did because the electrodes were falling apart and it felt like it was then or never. Next time with a sturdier array it should be much easier. That was sort of the point of this baseline. Lets fail a bunch, so we know how to take a proper swing at this. I was mostly looking forward to comments from people like yourself who&#39;ll fill in the gaps.

 Yeah, Steve Potter&#39;s Animats are pretty inspiring.  Nice work -  you got really far with this attempt.  With the size of your electrodes you&#39;ll need a lot of activity to see something through the noise.  Cardiac cells beat in sync and you will have a much better chance of getting results ... plus, you can show videos of them beating on your electrodes.  If you really want to stick to neurons, give them more time to grow.  It is rare to see spontaneous activity after 3 days - it usually takes a week or more.

 I&#39;ve only made a crappy digit recognizer using AI so I&#39;m far from an expert but it was interesting that you mentioned there are a lot of mechanisms neurons use. I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that emulating some of these other mechanisms is going to be the key to general purpose AI. AI can do some amazing things but I don&#39;t think simply scaling up what we currently do, playing with training techniques, layers etc is the answer.<br><br><br>Perhaps head cheese could be instrumental in discovering what we actually need to do? You get head cheese to do things which AI never learns even when scaled up,  there&#39;s probably a missing mechanism.

 Glass and polyproylene are two of the least-sticky materials I can think of. Usually in chemical industry when you want two dissimilar, inert materials to mate, you have a mechanical joint with some sort of gasket. I recommend experimenting with taking threaded test tubes, put em in a lathe by the thread side, glass blow a flange, and affix the flange to the slide with some sort of spring steel clip, and use some silicone o-rings or gaskets. You would have a much more robust mechanical assembly and as a bonus the tops would be re-usable, saving effort.<br><br>If you plug &quot;spring tie clip&quot; into a search, you&#39;ll see what I am thinking of.

 I just thought about using very thin gold wire as an electrode itself. Some bio-grade silicone adhesive could be used to attach the wire to the glass where needed. Alternatively the pads could be made from gold and fused to the glass. Gold wire could then be spot-welded to the pads which should not be too difficult if everything is very clean and appropriate current is used.

 why making your own &quot;PCB&quot; rather than buying one professional made?<br>Has to do with the base material, copper being toxic (but then doesn&#39;t silver has anti-bacteria properties that can complicate stuff too)?<br>Also probably you can get different material.

 nice work. i have had similar problems with autoclaving epoxy, specifically it was cracking (I work in a tissue engineering lab and was using it to make porous 3D printed PA non porous). try heating and cooling it more slowly, and dont open your autoclave until the whole thing has more or less cooled off to room temp (probably your glass is acting like a heat sink on one side of the epoxy causing it to heat/cool unevenly). autoclaving mixed material stuff is usually a pain. good luck

 What do you think the power source is for this &quot;circuit&quot;?  What do you consider to be ground?  Couldn&#39;t help but to notice you were measuring voltage between two neuron meshes.  Also how much power do you think the neurons can handle?  Great mad scientist stuff here but I think you&#39;re missing the electrical engineering design requirements.  To another commentator&#39;s point, there will be an impedance change between the electrodes and the neuron mesh.  It also seems like a better design to have the electrodes at the edges of the dish so that more neurons are used... but I might be projecting DNNs as they apply to computer science.

 Few years ago, I cleaned glass plates for building a liquid crystal cell. My cleaning protocol, which I recommend you use to get the microscope slides clean is the following:<br>1.  Put the slides inside an ultrasonic cleaner at 50 deg  (Celz) for 30 min. Use a container glass and build a holder for the glass slides so they will not lay on the bottom. fill the container glass with DI water and dish soap.<br>2. wash the glass slides and container glass with DI water.<br>3. Fill the container glass again, now with IPA and place the slides inside. then place them again in the ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min at 50 deg.<br>4. optional: place the slides in a UV ozone cleaner for 30 min, to remove organic remains that might be.<br>5. Buy soft cleaning cloths, fold each twice and apply some IPA on their round tip. swipe to one side twice and throw away the cloth. after few times, check the glass slide under a microscope. you may use 20-50 cloths till the glass is free from particle contamination (al least to a from um size).<br>I hope this helps :)

 You have a vacuum chamber! Just throw some oxygen in there and do a plasma clean! It&#39;ll be far more effective than piranha solution. You&#39;ll get a molecularly sterile plate.

 What if we grew the neurons inside an organism ( so just grow an organism) and then directly interfaced the organism to the computer? I doubt  would be as capable as neurons directly interfaced into a computer but it may be more stable. I don&#39;t actually know as I have no formal education on biological processes and frankly some of the things you do are magic to me. Because I&#39;m a material science and engineering major and I don&#39;t work with this stuff but I find it very fascinating.

 I&#39;ve wondered if provoking an explosion of neuron production in humans would improve intelligence or, in the least, the ability to learn quickly. Thanks for going over this experiment. I guess for my theory to work, a slower production would produce better results. 

 	Replies: Explosive growth would more or less result in the dieback of existing connections, doing a &quot;format C: on the brain&quot;. Also probably run into the brick wall of oxygen and nutrient supply, so many of the new neurons would end up dieing.

 It looks like you could use photolithography system to improve the resolution of your electrodes. A photomask should work a lot better than vinyl sheets.<br><br>If you redesign the electrodes, consider designing the pads so you can use a few pogo pin connectors on the pads. You might need a 3d print and/or a little PCB to hold the pogo pins to the slide.

 This may sound crazy but - I used to work in the PCB cad cam industry. A visit to a foreign  establishment showed them to be making masks to make PCBs by smoking a slide with soot, then scratching the pattern in the soot with a needle in a 2 D CNC plotter. The resulting lines were both sharp and VERY thin. If your going to go to Photo resist and really simple way to make very fine patterns is to project the pattern through a 50mm camera lens with the lens reversed. This gives a smaller image then the original but will be of good quality. You could do this onto photographic film and get a negative of course - In fact that is what the machines the company sold actually did to a resolution of 3 microns.

 You need to use stem cells from a former pilot to make the simulated airplane flying work.  In all seriousness, can small holes be drilled through the microscope slides to act as the contact points so that the traces are on the back of the slide?
