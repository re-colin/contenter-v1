MINOR CORRECTIONS:
In the graphics, "programme" should be "program".
I say "Mac instead of PC"; that should be "a phone instead of a PC".
And most importantly, I say "every sixth cycle": that should be "every ninth".
Fortunately, none of these materially affect the content of the video!

 I have been following you for years, watching your videos about everything from cool stories about geography, games... Last year I started studying computer science, and tomorrow I have a test on computer structure. I had no clue on the fetch decode execute cycle, and was desperately looking for something on youtube (as one does). I saw your face and was inmediately relieved, as your narrating skills would make me get it instantly. You have saved a fellow computer scientist my friend.

 It gets more complicated than what Tom explained in this video, there&#39;s 2 types for a computer to understand code - a compiler, and an interpreter. If you think about it, languages are still written in some other programming languages. For example, NodeJS is written in C/C++. NodeJS  is technically not really a &quot;programming language&quot;, rather a &quot;Javascript Runtime&quot;. In a nutshell, it runs Javascript on your machine client-side, rather than in your browser. Other, faster runtimes exist nowadays, for example - bun.js<br><br>To be clear though, the Javascript in your browser is still ran client-side, it&#39;s just that NodeJS makes it possible to make genuine apps with Javascript without needing the browser.<br><br>Javascript is not a compiled language, otherwise - it never would need a runtime (unless the designers decided to make a compiler and interpreter for it, but it was meant to be ran in the browser anyways, and as something that&#39;s always sent with the page you load - it just wouldn&#39;t make sense to compile the file, as it would be insecure). Instead, it is an <b>interpreted</b> language. This means that your computer runs some other program to try and understand the code that is written in Javascript, and convert it to the instructions your computer can understand at runtime. Of course, it&#39;s a lot more complicated than that, but I could speak for hours on that sort of stuff.

 Then there is the conditional jump which takes a bit and jumps if its 1 or is ignored if 0 (or vice-versa depending on the instruction). This is practically what makes every interactive program possible, ...and screws around with the entire fetch-execute cycle.

 This is a very informative video for people to understand the basics of computer architecture, but unfortunately computers haven&#39;t worked like this since the 80&#39;s really. Sure the basic idea is the same of fetch, decode, execute is the same somewhat, but with modern superscalar pipelines, a lot of the details of how that happens is different. Today it would be Fetch, Dispatch, Schedule, Execute, Status Update. and each stage would happen simultaneously, with the execute stage executing multiple instructions at once out of order. Fetching multiple instructions at once and dispatching them as they are decoded for them then to be scheduled onto an execute unit. Then the Status Update would put the instructions back in order for the user. Computers today are order&#39;s of magnitude more complex than computers back then. Good video still.

They wouldn&#39;t just start coding the animations or graphics from nothing‚Äîit starts with a pencil and paper. Probably grid paper, once they had worked out the rough idea. To ensure the animation was legible, capture each frame on film then play it back. Or, more simply, just flip the pages.

 I think you&#39;re oversimplifying a bit here. Even the most simple CPUs require multiple clock cycles for simple instructions. And of course you need at least one clock cycle for every memory address.<br>In your case you use direct memory addressing, which would require a clock cycle to read the instruction, a clock cycle to decode the instruction, a clock cycle to read the memory address, a clock cycle to read the value at that memory address, and finally a clock cycle to execute the instruction.<br>Of course your program is quite badly written, too.<br><br>LDA $6<br>LOOP: ; informational only, label. not actually cpu instruction, just a reference for later<br>INC ; implied addressing, no need to read memory to add 1<br>STA $6<br>; assumes some kind of interrupt to break out of the loop<br>BRA LOOP ; (-3), branch always, endless loop, better than jump because jump uses more bytes for the address<br><br>would be a lot more efficient because it doesn&#39;t direct addressing but implied addressing for the adding and branches use relative addressing, which is on 16, 32 and 64 bit cpus very much shorter (-128 to 127 bits relative, which is one byte instead of 2, 4 or 8 which you would otherwise have to load from memory) and allows more easy use of caching and more efficient pipelining because you don&#39;t switch memory pages.

 Modern CPUs can also fetch while they&#39;re decoding, and decode while they&#39;re executing meaning they get closer to 1:1 instructions per clock. More interestingly though is hyperthreading, where a single CPU can execute two or more instructions at once depending on what part of the CPU those instructions are using e.g. they might be able to execute a jump instruction at the same time as doing an add. Modern CPUs are crazy complex and the x86 instruction set is more or less interpreted on a virtual machine that does loads on real time heuristics to schedule instructions for execution simultaneously.

 Well counting up actually never breaks<br>Usually, for example, if the size of the accumulator would be 8 bits then it can store up values from 0 to 255<br>When you try to add 1 to 255 you get something called overflow and the accumulator is &quot;overflowed&quot; to 0. It&#39;s a more complex subject, but you would have an infinite loop and it would probably just use 0.01% of your CPU power at all times!!

 In the video JUMP 1 sets the PC to 1 and the next FETCH would increment the PC to 2 and the accumulator would never increment. So the instruction would be JUMP 1, but would be encoded as JUMP 0 and would set the PC to 0. Otherwise the HW engineer will need to waste a handful of gates and implement an incredibly risky DONT_INC_PC flag which would not be good if someone set it.

 I just can&#39;t visualize four billion times per second. I understand it on an intellectual level, but it&#39;s such a  non-intuitive concept. If you watch the How does it know with the Scott CPU (coincidence?) it runs at two hertz in the video. That is easily comprehensible. Billions of times per second is not. That in and of itself is just an amazing feat. We take it for granted, of course. But that brute force is the whole key to how it works.

 What does &quot;decode&quot; mean if it can be done in a single tick?<br>Does the &quot;fetch&quot; portion of the cycle include the coming and the going? If there is nothing to fetch, does the cpu default to endless subroutines of fetch attempts?<br>Also, when a pulse is sent through that cpu, why should it discharge to one function only? Can it not send for data AND, meanwhile on the other side, add a bit to the register, on the same tick?

 This was a fun video, however multi-threaded programming is a beast of a challenge, try creating a bunch of threads, have them increment the same variable, you&#39;ll lose tons of increments because if it fetches, then at any point changes threads before it stores in that 3 step process, it assumes the instruction set was complete, so it will pull it from memory again, and then increment.<br><br><br>you can lose anywhere from 30% to 50% of the increments in my experience. this is where thread protection and mutexes come in handy, but they are expensive, so if it&#39;s a non essential code block generally we accept out losses and run anyways. (poorly engineered thread protection is also a great way to have threading deadlocks)

 I did code a 16-bit RISC assembly program once for a project, which was an interpreter for ASCII encoded commands and piping of data in an FPGA soft core to control the hardware blocks&#39; functionality. There are some really clever things you can do at the machine code level to make your code small and fast, but to do so correctly is very hard and basically requires you to be able to step through the code flow in your head (or with flowcharts for assistance). If you think refactoring c++, java or C# is hard, try refactoring hundreds or thousands of lines of assembly. Some experience with code golfing can come in really handy then. (our case was on the order of 450-500 lines of an initial assembly implementation getting refactored and reduced to 150 lines because of a need to keep more data state in the limited registers, and a severe penalty for too much memory access to shuffle data between RAM and registers.

 Ah, good ol&#39; ECE 4613 -- Computer Architecture.  That example&#39;s a little on the slow side, though -- typically you&#39;ll see some pipelining, with instruction 2 loading while instruction 1 decodes, or rather instruction 2 loading and decoding while instruction 1 goes about the rather slower process of executing (provide the execute phase hasn&#39;t been split up and not counting speeding things along some more by making memory accesses another phase in the pipe).  That way once the pipe fills up, you&#39;re burning through a phase of as many instructions as you have pipeline phases all at once (which gives the components no respite, often making them switch every clock cycle, dramatically increasing heat build-up), making for big ol&#39; gains in throughput when not frustrated by conditional jumps making a missed branch prediction mean dumping large portions of the pipe, leaving a so-called &quot;bubble&quot;.<br>I sure can see why you left it out, though!

 Isnt the clock on the MoBo though, CPU just takes that and runs it through a multiplier to get its speed(in hertz), which it runs the instructions at. 

 	Replies: Modern computers are much much more complex. They have multiple clocks, multiplicators and different ways to transfer data from one bus with one speed to a other bus with a other speed.<br>The clock source comes from a crystal. Most PCs have multiple crystals.<br>Also, a modern CPU does not make one instruction in one cycle. They split the instruction up in many small steps (like explained in this video) and try to run them in parallel as much as they can. While the write the data for instruction 0, they already try to read the data for instruction 1, decode the data for instruction 2 and fetch the instruction for instruction 3. They even try to do it completely parallel if the data of instruction 0 does not affect instruction 1. That is how they can do multiple instructions in one clock cycle. It becomes complicated if a instruction needs the data of that the previous instruction wrote or when there are conditional jumps.

 If you get into it further it gets even cooler. Modern cpus take those instructions and execute them out of order if one needs to wait, they do those jump instructions before they know they actually need to to do work in advance, they do all three of those steps (fetch, decode, execute) at the same time for multiple instructions, and many don&#39;t even have a specific set of bits for each register: they just rename and move them around as time passes to allow that parallelism from earlier to work properly.

 Your description of compiling is off. You say that if you want to move your program to a different OS you can  just compile for that cpu, however you can run macOS, Windows 10 and Ubuntu all on a single processor and they won&#39;t be able to compile and execute the same code (depending on the high level language)

 Very nice explanation! My informatics teacher at school actually wrote a virtual machine (for DOS) with it&#39;s own simple assembler language and some simulated IO to display text that allowed us students to step through the code and see what actually happens on the CPU.

 I know you are sponsored... but KeePass is better.<br>It&#39;s an application you install and it encrypts your passwords into a local database. So it&#39;s never online and its 100% free! I&#39;ve used it for years! Very handy and 0 risk data leaks cuz data never once leaves your local machine!

 Random symbols make the passwords hard for us to remember. It doesn&#39;t make it harder for a computer to crack. Better to have a longer password than a short one, regardless of the &quot;complexity&quot; involved. Make up a sentence that is 40+ characters long, and it&#39;s virtually crack-proof. Then alter that sentence depending on the website, and you&#39;ve got passwords no one can guess, that no one can crack, and that you can remember easily.

859: AURORA FIELDS 
 In all honesty, after working with assembly for years, its not all that much more difficult than, say, C. While you are using more text and more lines to express what you want, it also makes you think more deeply about the problem you are solving, helping you avoid bugs proactively, and making solving some problems actually easier. It doesn&#39;t even take much longer for me to write code, yet it makes easier for the code to be self documenting and easier for me to document it better. However, learning to be proficient assembly programmer will inevitably be more difficult because there is a lot of nuance in understanding how individual instructions relate to the whole problem as a whole and how to write well optimized code. I think writing assembly code will be very good practice for anyone using a more modern languages; there are many lessons to be learned from using assembly that can vastly benefit you in writing even in object oriented languages.

 Three more features gets you awfully close to a &quot;modern&quot; CPU:<br>- Pipelining - each step of the fetch, decode, execute loop becomes a one or several steps that all happen on each clock cycle. In a simple example, your CPU would have 3 stages and complete 1 instruction per clock cycle. If your code is full of branches and dependencies, it will have to stop and wait (stall)<br>- Branch prediction - guessing the outcome of a branch will prevent your pipeline from stalling as often. If the CPU guesses incorrectly, it will have to discard the incorrectly executed pipeline steps (flush the pipe)<br>- Out-of-Order operations - safely rearranging the incoming steps will reduce the number of stalls as well<br><br><br>It would be cool to see your &quot;CPU&quot; evolve with each of these. I&#39;d feel bad for your fingers though.

 Excellent video! To be fair, modern assemblers look only slightly different from high or mid level languages nowadays. On the other hand, high and mid level languages have become so efficient in their code conversion that you don&#39;t gain nearly as much as you used to by going straight to the bare metal, especially with computers being exponentially more powerful than they used to be. For example, on a 1 mhz Commodore 64 you wouldn&#39;t want to use BASIC for too much for speed critical things, so ASM was what almost all coders used on that machine (Java didn&#39;t exist and even C was not super prevalent yet).<br><br>ASM is kind of a lost art, but it is a mental challenge nonetheless, which is why some people will gravitate towards it over other languages.

 The question that always used to get me was, well sure - the CPU is decoding and executing. But how does it know how to do that? Well, it&#39;s all about the instruction set and that&#39;s usually physically wired in by millions of transistors by the clever people at Intel / AMD / ARM. Imagine making physical wires that contain the instructions for how to do something! Sounds crazy... and yet that&#39;s exactly how computers used to be made. By Hand. <b>Head explodes</b>

 Does JUMP 1, really put the counter to 1? doesn&#39;t your loop consist of FETCH always increasing the counter by 1 and than loading the information from there? Meaning if the loop was consistent in this example the JUMP 1 should either be JUMP 0 or the JUMP function is read as jump to X-1. So the counter gets set to 0 and at next fetch when the counter increases it actually is 1 like we wanted.<br>Other than this small thing, great video as always :D

 I think it would make a little more sense if you included the following:<br><br>‚Ä¢ When you intoduced the clock, you could have said that this isn&#39;t in the sense of having a thing that tells the time, but is more like a metronome delivering a signal on the tick that kicks the processor into action. <br><br>‚Ä¢ In your diagram, you could have had a box for the decoded instruction to be stored. Just saying &#39;Decode: the cpu decodes the instruction&#39; and reading out the instruction may not make sense. You could have said it decodes the instruction into something the control unit can understand, and <b>store it</b> for the execute step. Just from the visuals, it looks like nothing happens in the decode step.<br><br>‚Ä¢ You could have mentioned the BIG thing that makes this model different to the computers we use. Input devices that allow the program to react to something the human did after turning it on.

So CPUs have a small amount of super fast storage in them called cache. Data gets loaded to the cache from RAM before the CPU needs it, so the CPU can access the data quickly when it does need it. The computer has to guess what data the CPU will need to load into cache, so sometimes it still needs to access data that is still stored in the RAM.

 Hello Tom, I am a IT-Teacher. Great Video, I might use it in my classes (provided they know enough English). We do Microcomputer programming in Assembler and even basic 8-bit binary instructions. What would make the instruction explanation even better, if you used RAM addresses as letters instead of numbers. A student might get confused by add 7 (when you then only add the 1 at address 7). Would be better if it read address G. That would help further down the line with Hex address coding a bit as well.<br><br><br>Also, the students we have, and people watching this, should also be more familiar with the concept of a variable. A=7 or something.

 Would I rather have 20 or so similar passwords known by nobody but me, or pay money to create a &quot;master key&quot; password through a third party, creating a single point of entry on every single service on top of the randomized passwords?<br><br><br>No thanks, Tom. Amazing video, but I don&#39;t care for the ad since I would look to increase my security. At least, twenty similar passwords and no master key could mean since my passwords aren&#39;t identical, the &quot;try same password and user&quot; strategy doesn&#39;t work cross-platform, and there isn&#39;t one service with a giant master key to my stuff and a giant target on its back. 

 	Replies: Except are you really going to remember your 20 passwords?<br><br><br>Most likely you are going to reuse them which is a vastly greater security vulnerability than any single point of entry problem caused by a password manager.<br><br><br>Or they are going to be similar passwords, meaning that if 2 or 3 are found out, the rest can likely be decoded. You in the end only have the security of one password. And its worse than a cryptographicly secure password generation like the dashlane algorithm because it can be decoded easily by a human.<br><br><br>Anyways I recommend open password managers such as masterpassword instead of this. Same principle, but completely offline and cryptographicly secure.

 Hmm, am I missing something with the Jump command? It&#39;s explained earlier that the switch from Execute to Fetch increases the Programme Counter by 1, yet the counter stays at 1 after executing the jump 1 command - shouldn&#39;t fetch increase that to counter 2, executing another STORE 6 and leading to an infinite loop where all that essentially happens would be overwriting value in address 6 with what&#39;s already in there, while the process explained should be the result of JUMP 0? Tom briefly explains that &#39;The next address we fetch from is address No. 1&#39;, but doesn&#39;t that defy the logic laid out earlier?

 Also fun to know: Your PC has basically two types of storage: volatile, meaning data will be deleted once you turn your PC off, and non-volatile (persistent) storage. Your RAM is volatile, hard drive/SSD non-volatile. When the PC runs out of RAM, the operating system decides to put some of the data in your RAM into a file on your hard drive, called a swap-file. Most high-level programming languages have no way of mitigating this and password managers are usually written in high-level languages, meaning that using them can result in passwords lying around in a swap-file on your PC that can technically be read out by anyone getting their hands on your hard drive. Still probably more secure than re-using passwords, just letting you know. 

 	Replies: Not really. Password managers still store the password on the harddrive. Plus, swapfiles are regularly cleared by the OS :)

 so...<br>The fetch is &quot;RAM -&gt; internal registers&quot;<br>The decode is... no wait, what does it mean to &quot;decode&quot; an instruction set for the central processing unit? I don&#39;t see any good explanation in this video, just a brief summarization.<br>The execute is &quot;do the instruction, whether it is to set a new value for the program counter, to do an operation with any specified address of the RAM and the accumulator and store it in the accumulator, to set a new value for the accumulator, to set a new value in any specified address of the RAM using the accumulator, etc.&quot;<br><br><br>So if anyone can help me grasp the concept of decoding an instruction set, that would be nice. The way I see it, it just does nothing, like a wasted operation. Does it prepares the CPU for its execute phase? Does it enables the read line in the RAM if the instruction is ADD, for example? What does it do and what does it means concretely to decode something? 

 	Replies: It&#39;s the time it takes to set up. If it&#39;s ADD, it has to copy the inputs into the addition circuit. If it&#39;s LOAD or STORE, it has to tell the memory what address it wants to access. The video doesn&#39;t really cover it.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> - I think you Random Access Memory is called random because the access to any of the stored information is supposed to be quick (&quot;random&quot; as a &quot;free&quot;, not &quot;without particular order&quot;). Quoting Wikipedia: &quot;A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement. &quot; 

 	Replies: With many of those, you can&#39;t access memory in purely random order. You have to read/write a whole sector at a time. So even without the speed being a factor, they can&#39;t be connected directly to the CPU like RAM can, without some layer to manage getting individual bytes from sectors.

 By the way, when you overclocking you are increasing the amount of times the clock in the CPU tics, causing your CPU to run faster. 

 	Replies: ...and the reason you don&#39;t just crank it up to a billion GHz is that the faster it gets, the more it encounters issues with heat, electromagnetic noise, energy consumption, and the time it takes for the actual electrical signals to travel. You can get away with going a bit beyond the rated speed if you&#39;re careful about energy and cooling, but the more you push it, the less stable it gets, until it eventually can&#39;t even run a few seconds without some component malfunctioning causing the entire system to crash and need a reboot.

 A question for the sponsor @Dashlane:<br>If i use the same password for everything and it gets cracked im screwed...<br>...but what if someone cracks my dashlane login? same situation no? 

 	Replies: Not an answer from dashlane, but an answer anyway. Your comparision ist not quite correct. If dashlane stores your password on their server your credentials are only at risk if dashlane is attacked and not with every single breach of any website you&#39;ve been using. Also, if they don&#39;t store your passwords on their server, so that you have them in your local storage it&#39;s even safer. Then you have to be attacked directly and that is way more unlikely than dashlane being attacked. But wether that is safer than writing all those passwords on a sheet of paper and putting it into your save - that&#39;s a question for another day.

 Next question: How exactly does the CPU do this? There are like electrons in there, right? How do the electrons do any of this?<br><br>I assume there are series of logic gates everywhere that the electrons pass through, but like how? What combination of logic gates tells the computer to ‚Äústore the data in address 6‚Äù? 

 	Replies: Alex Trickier That&#39;s what the Decode step is responsible for. Probably the simplest design is to have a component called a decoder, which converts a binary input into an output on the corresponding select line (so inputing binary 2, 10, into a 2x4 DCD would set output 2 to high and the other 3 outputs to low). From those output lines, you&#39;d have some simple logic that turns various components on or off, depending on the instruction. Each instruction translates into a number, which is feed into the decoder, which selects the corresponding output, which turns the correct things on or off.<br>For &quot;store data to address 6&quot; in Tom&#39;s computer, the decoder would read the top 4 bits of the instruction register (0100), select output 4, turn off output from the RAM, turn off input to the other registers, turn on giving the bottom 4 bits of the instruction register to the address input of the RAM (0110, or our address 6), turn on reading from the accumulator, and turn on the write input on the RAM. <br>At a gate level, decoders are just a bunch of AND gates that turn on based on a specific binary input. More complex instructions (like those that are also dependent on external factors like flags) may have extra gates right after the decoder to check those conditions.

 My masters degree used a different type of paradigm in terms of an instruction set. There was only one instruction: move.<br>Rather than an ALU - arithmetic logic unit - there was custom functional units - FUs - much like using ASICs. All you did was move the data to the inputs on these FUs and retrieve the result when required - after a certain number of clock cycles depending on complexity.<br>I investigated biological mechanisms in this paradigm. What would happen if an FU is defective - could you replicate its functionality using less complex FUs at a sacrifice of more computing time.

 In case someone wants to learn sort-of assembly language (very close to it anyway) for fun, i&#39;d recommend &quot;shenzhen IO&quot;. It&#39;s quite niche as a game, but quite interesting if you are into that sort of thing. Comes with manuals of course. Skills learned in that game might actually be useful if you end up in electronics industry.

 how does the actual clock work, physically, as well as the instructions? 

 	Replies: The clock is implemented using something similar to a Quartz Crystal (the one used in quartz watches). Every clock tick, it sends electricity through the CPU that allows the circuits to function and produce output. The faster the clock ticks, the better performance you get, which is what happens when you overclock the CPU I think. The instructions are implemented in hardware as physical semiconductor circuits with millions of logic gates.
