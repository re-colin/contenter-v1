 I learned more in 15 minutes than I have in 40 years regarding this topic. I understand how college is designed to extract the best of the best to go into the business world, but it really leaves the general public behind by not starting out teaching in the way your video did. (dog might not be 100% necessary) Not that I would become a programmer, but to quickly get that this isnt something that only geniuses can manage to contemplate makes me want to give a big middle finger to the elitist education system. Anyway, thank you for this!

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMpNhbMjDj0&amp;t=477">7:57</a> Is this why so much of the color space on computers is almost-indistinguishable shades of green at full value and saturation? Because they&#39;re secretly standing in for turquoise that the screen can&#39;t display? I&#39;ve wondered about this my whole life! I thought maybe I was minorly colorblind in green, or something.

 Though, do note that with the more abstraction you introduce, you do make things easier to do without having to think a lot about it, but you also limit the performance gains you are able to do, because you then have limited yourself to only doing what that abstraction allows for.  Also, it introduces overhead to do the abstraction, that in some cases aren&#39;t needed.  So if you can, try to fit the abstraction around the data it will be operating on, rather than trying to fit it around every possible input.  Also, you should be willing to use a different abstraction, or no abstraction at all if your data differs enough from the intended data for the abstraction.  This way you still get the ease of use from using abstractions, while limiting the performance impact that might have.  Also, not everything needs to be abstracted, sometimes it&#39;s just easier to just do it manually, as introducing abstractions can make it harder to do what you want to do, especially if the intended goal for the abstraction has changed over time.

 oh wow, so abstractions are like applying context. a 0110 can be anything i want it to be. wow. this is such a powerful concept. but does this prove that truth is arbitrary. i cannot say what is a 1 or a 0 but i can define what a 1 or 0 means. its like wield the sword of truth, but pointing it arbitrarily.  ... i am a schizophrenic learning about flawed logical thinking and irrational feelings thought the absoluteness of 1 and 0 of computer science. learning boolean logic is helping me also keep my own thoughts gated in the same way to make sure they make rational sense. .... maybe thats why computer science is so hard. it is up to the egineer to figure out how to connect the logic to make rational results. which itself is arbitrary. like learning 0110 could be a letter, a number, a command, a part of a greater word, or be composed of other words. but it still dont change the truth of 0110 no matter how that truth is applied.

 Binary isn&#39;t inefficient. It&#39;s long, but not inefficient. And arithmetics in it are quite fast. Even square roots are simple to calculate. Search what&#39;s the best base that has a &quot;not base 6&quot; in the thumbnail on YouTube to get more in depth explaination.

 The quality of your productions is insane! Like literally, who else goes all in with content structure, narrative, sound design, perfect transitions and so many other design intricacies for an educational YouTube video? Love your style. I was wondering if you do many parts of this in Blender? And if so, do you copy keyframes to new objects to keep the style consistent, e.g. to have the same ease-in transform when objects appear on-screen? And what about procedural animations, do you code them in Python in Blender or use some other tools like Manim? 

 	Replies: ['@JoshsHandle', 'I don&#39;t generally copy-paste keyframes as that would require more adjusting than just creating the keyframes from scratch each time. Adding the easing is pretty easy, I have the transformation I need to do to get that effect pretty much in muscle memory. The procedural animation is all powered by geometry nodes. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been using more and more lately. I&#39;m looking into using it to automate some routine animations in the video I&#39;m currently working on.', '@splience', '\u200b@@JoshsHandle Didn&#39;t expect it to be geometry nodes but from what I&#39;ve seen they are so powerful (but well that&#39;s almost like saying coding in a turing-complete language is pretty powerful 😅).

 The technique of just having one of the 15 values on and the rest off was actually used in some early computers. Though it was more like 1 out of 5 paired with a 1 out of 2, with the pair indicating whether the group of 5 represented a value from 0-4 or 5-9, and the whole bi-quinary set representing a single decimal digit. It may be inefficient to implement, but it made debugging the hardware easier, and back then, being able to debug hardware problems was very important.

 Ok, first off super informative, and perhaps I&#39;m just so tired I accidentally skipped ahead instead of pausing, but I have to ask... So how does the computer know what it&#39;s doing with the &quot;baked in&quot; firmware instructions?  When a computer is booted up, how does it know to treat the presence of electricity as anything other than some electricity, there, but none there. Or to word it better I suppose: What happens at the instant there&#39;s power? How does it know to do ANYTHING with the first strings of 10101010101010101000000111010?

 Another way that you can compress data into an even smaller file is the Run Length Encoding (RLE) method. For example, if you have a image that looked like this:<br><br>0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  <br>0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 <br>0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0               (i am using ones and zeroes as a visual representation)<br>0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0<br>0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 <br><br>In the image, we have what looks similar to a rhombus or circle. Run Length Encoding works by scanning a certain row. In this row, there could be a certain amount of 0&#39;s or 1&#39;s in a row. In the real world, these are colors. In the example seen above, in the first few rows, there are:<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Raw data:<br><br>zero zero zero zero one one zero zero zero zero<br>zero zero one one one one one one zero zero<br>zero one one one one one one one one zero<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Run length encoding would work by storing the amount that a certain color or pixel repeats in a row as a co-efficient relative to the value of that color or pixel.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>After being Run Length Encoded:<br><br>4x0, 2x1, 4x0 \n          &lt;-- \n means new line<br>2x0, 6x1, 2x0 \n<br>1x0, 8x1, 1x0 \n<br>2x0, 6x1, 2x0 \n<br>4x0, 2x1, 4x0 \ n<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Now, instead of the raw data being a long line of ones and zeroes, it is a ordered and compressed version or itself. <br><br>RLE is one of many methods that can be used for LOSSLESS DATA COMPRESSION.<br><br>Such files like JPEG and PNG use lossy compression, which losses either some of the detail or color variation in the image.

 I somehow doubt that researchers recently found that 1024 bits is very useful for your time to upload.  I love how you sliding that in there, I had to rewind.  Mate, this is such an amazing video as it was something I couldn&#39;t understand why, and then the production quality is fantastic in that it really helps to understand such a humanly foreign concept (naturally, as we have 10 fingers).  I&#39;m sure the researchers also found out that quality like this takes time, so tell them to stick that in their 1024 bit pipe and smoke it

 It is not bad, but it could be better. The formats are standard across every system. I built a whole document on it and even showed how to take programs apart one operation code at a time at CPU level.<br>There is a lot missing, such as magic numbers at the start of the file known as signature numbers that identify the format type and is used for redundancy. How metric is used with the binary size of byte data and bits. All systems read data in bytes in memory which is 8 bits. The order the bytes can be read in can be in little byte order or big byte order and are stored in word grouping sizes. Video memory is stored in pairs of three bytes for each color going to a connected monitor. The bit map picture format is a hardware independent picture format as it can be written directly to video memory across all systems and hardware. Graphics cards can compute and set different pairs of three-byte colors as different colors calling graphics drawing functions. The CPU in your computer can also write pairs of three bytes to any position in video memory, changing a color on your display. Video memory exists in game consoles and computers and is generally the same RGB format. Text is standardized across all game consoles and computer devices to allow text-based communication; see the Unicode standard <a href="https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html">https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html</a>. Audio wave files store audio as is without compression and can be played directly across systems, much the same as a bit map picture. All processors that are x86 understand the same machine code operations since the 8086 processor in the 1980&#39;s and can run dos natively. Native machine code that computers understand as instructions are standardized by processor type. A x86 compiled program will run on an x86 core without translations. An ARM type core will not run x86 instructions as it runs ARM-encoded binary instructions. The graphics memory (video memory) and audio formats are read and displayed the same even if we are on an ARM core running ARM-encoded machine code instructions. You may also like a article that me and a couple of people helped clean up on the mac OS application format.<br>.<br>Another thing to take note of is that the word and grouping size of bytes have different type names such as integers, when we use binary as a 8bit number or 16bit number in word grouping size as bytes. Floating point numbers comprise of a sing, exponent and mantissa and may sound complicated, but actually is very simple and are the same across processor cores and hardware. It is amazing how very little changes between systems. The thing that does change is the speed and performance that newer hardware can operate at. Also, the introduction of callable functions we can call that do processing for us that are dedicated to do a particular task requiring a driver. The ability to switch operating systems. Other than that, the base binary formats never really change, and even machine code and compilers do not change much unless we introduce new operation codes that once did an undefined operation on older x86 cores or ARM cores to speed up a calculation. 

 	Replies: ['@damianrecoskie3176', 'Once you understand the standards, it also makes it easy to take any software or program apart also, considering machine code and encodable operation codes are standardized by core type, such as x86 runs x86 encoded binary instructions.<br>I also plan to clean up how Microsoft and ELF files are read. I did a lot of cleanup work on the Mach-O application format on Wikipedia and even built my own decompiler. Other than that, I am glad to see someone putting in some effort to better explain the simplicity and standardization of different binary formats and data types and how they are read and processed. I also really like your style and video presentations. You are very talented.']

 A lot of this does reinforce my base knowledge of how things work in computers (which is probably what the title of the video should have been since the video is concerned with transistors, graphics, etc.).

 This is a really good, intuitive, 1000 mile flyover of computing. I just have one gripe, one tiny, little issue which is the explanation of why. First of we also use analog data processing, which is processing data at its voltage, interference be damned. And we have methods to minimize interference for them. But I get that is another rabbit hole to go down, I just feel it would have been nice to mention. The 2nd is that it&#39;s not so much that other systems are too susceptible to interference, I mean they are but again with analogue we have ways to minimize that. The real issue is that there aren&#39;t any particularly useful applications that involve any more than 2 states. You can get some speed efficiency sure, but for any greater than binary logic gate you can just run more binary logic gates in parallel. For example, why use a quaternary gate when you can just make a system that handles bytes, which is what we did.

Couldn&#39;t we combine a red, green, and blue light together to make a white light as the output?<br><br>In my example, wouldn&#39;t that be analogous to sending a 3-bit message in one light beam? As opposed to sending three 2-bit messages via electrical on/off combinations. 00 = off, 01 = red, 10 = blue, 11 = green?<br><br>I&#39;ve read a little bit about optical computing but, why aren&#39;t we using fiber optics or something to create a light-based system? What are the limitations?

 Add the fact that Base 10 is probably used so prevalently by humans because 10 fingers, but requires 10 separate symbols, 0-9.  Binary restricts to minimum 2, 0-1, on/off (electricity), etc.  Any fewer just gives constant state.  No choice, very boring.

 This is hands down the best summary video I&#39;ve seen on the subject. I&#39;ve been coding for around 10 years now and as a self taught programmer I initially had so many questions about how computers work as it all kind of feels like magic in the beginning. This video would&#39;ve really helped to wrap my head around some concepts back then! It was still very cool to watch it now. Would highly recommend to anyone starting in the field or anyone willing to understand a bit more about how computers work.

 Nothing escapes the gravitational pull of the blackhole when things become so near it&#39;s event horizon, beyond event horizon there&#39;s no turning back everything sucked in by gravity. Nothing can enter a white hole because the white hole spits out bursts of energies coming out not in. Only God can make us enter the white light entrance as He said he can change the effect of the Orion&#39;s belt as another phenomena.

 The black hole engulfs using it&#39;s very strong gravitational pull, objects, things, planets, stars, and galaxies can be engulfed by a black hole depends on size because the center of every spiral galaxy has shining center hole gravitational pull that can become blackhole though blackholes can reappear anywhere in space, area of the blackhole has large something, a universe. The other side of blackhole after entering the worm hole is a black nothing space but the exit from the wormhole is a rare white hole that seldom appears and that white hole spits out strong energies that can create a universe in the other side and there are plenty of black holes and seldom white holes meaning there can be many universes created in a thin dimension between black holes and white holes, called multiverse which are space polarities by itself and it goes on and on like number 9 which is continuous, goes on and on the universe on 1 side to 0 to the other side and filling up the 0 to something as 1 and again 0 on the other side from thin to wide, from wide to thin on and on and on.

 1 signifies singularity in science, 1 signifies spiritual balancing like the 1 God in spirit God the Father, Christ and holy spirit in the good side and evil 1 in the dark side, 0 means nothing, to suffer, to shadow, people as in row though they have varieties claiming the row, and everything was created out of nothing or 0, because if there&#39;s something on the other side, something will be created from nothing and when that nothing or 0 have something already, the other side of them will be 0 again or nothing.

 Brilliant, brilliant work. I was always wondering why 1s and 0s because I read about this book called Children of Time and there was a part there were arachnid species use ants, like ants with their brains intact, as computers and they program with it. And I knew it was something related to 1s and 0s because, theoretically you could make a computer out of anything as long as you usijg bits.

 I looooved this video. Not only because of the animation as others have mentioned, but I think this is one of the best descriptions of the beauty of Computer Science. It&#39;s like that video of a guy using his MacBooks trackpad and saying &quot;how does it know??? how does it know where my finger is moving?!&quot; while he moves his finger in circles and the pointer moves across the screen. I think this video explains how that works fundamentally. Abstraction and Functions all the way down.

If you want to draw a really dark picture, there aren&#39;t that many dark tones you can use so it looks blocky. Tom Scott did a good video on it. 255 for each color might sound like a lot, but when you&#39;re ONLY working in really dark colors, that number is really small

 Using binary is just playing a game of 20 Questions, except it&#39;s more like 8 Questions, 16 Questions, etc. Something I often say is that while binary is how computers work on the level of individual wires, you could argue that from the point of view of the CPU, it&#39;s more accurate to say that the computer works in binary-coded base 256. The exact wording is borrowed from &quot;binary-coded decimal,&quot; which uses 4 bits to represent a decimal digit. The same logic can be used to argue that our clocks aren&#39;t decimal, but rather &quot;decimal-coded base 60.&quot;)<br><br>For an 8 bit number N:<br>Is N &gt; 127?<br>Is (N % 128) &gt; 63?<br>Is (N % 64) &gt; 31?<br>Is (N % 32) &gt; 15?<br>Is (N % 16) &gt; 7?<br>Is (N % 8) &gt; 3?<br>Is (N % 4) &gt; 1?<br>Is (N % 2) &gt; 0?<br><br>In a way, compression sort of works by peeling back the abstraction. Videos are conceptually just a sequence of images, but video compression requires peeling back that abstraction to actually look at what&#39;s in each image and how they differ. Similarly, Huffman coding throws out letters as numbers and instead returns to looking at individual bits to encode each. Compilers act in a similar manner as compressors, de-abstracting the input to produce something that may not be smaller, but is still more efficient to process.

 Rather than firmware I instead would have mentioned MIME types and file headers, since that I think matches closer to what you were referring to, but overall really enjoyed the summarized version of it all. 

 	Replies: ['@DiThi', 'That depends on the operating system (and the most popular OS for PCs only uses file extensions), so it makes sense that he went to explain where the instructions to interpret file extensions and even show the file names come from, and what runs that. Although instead of &quot;firmware&quot; I would have probably said &quot;bootloader&quot;.', '@Cigam_HFden', '@@DiThi As far as I know all OS&#39;s use mime types, but yes most people would understand file extensions more. Yeah I agree what he was mentioning is more bootloader than firmware. Overall though it still conveys the general message.', '@DiThi', '@@Cigam_HFden Do you mean headers? (Or more correctly, file signatures or &quot;magic numbers&quot; since some are not in headers). Those are used to then figure out the mime type, but it&#39;s not the only way: in fact plenty of web servers use the extension to decide which mime type is sent in the HTTP header. It&#39;s not just a Windows/DOS thing. Yeah, Windows may also read headers of most files, but extensions are the primary way of telling the user what file type it is and what is it opened with.', '@Cigam_HFden', '@@DiThi Yeah I meant headers mostly, and people do focus on the file extensions. I have even written some programs that decide on stuff based on the extension. Linux is nice that on files with no extensions, in the file browser it will label the mime type as an image, text, etc just depending on what it can determine. For the most part though extensions are what is used. That being said most of those extensions are in categories as well, whether it is audio, video, images, documents, etc. Windows (mostly 11) will change the file explorer view based on what types of files are in the folder, using those kinds of categories.']

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMpNhbMjDj0&amp;t=774">12:54</a> This part is backwards. Voltage is more like the speed of water and amperage is more like the pressure (that is, the number of electrons/water-molecules). - Though to be accurate, the speed <i>comes</i> from the pressure whereas voltage doesn&#39;t specifically come (directly) <i>from</i> it&#39;s current (Ohm&#39;s law notwithstanding). But then, the water/pipe analogy for electricity was always tenuous at best, this is just another example of why it doesn&#39;t quite work. - This is why teachers make the big bucks, because trying to come up with good analogies to explain things is hard.

 If you started a Patreon, I&#39;d join in a heartbeat. Don&#39;t even care if there&#39;s exclusive content or not, it would just make me happy to be able to help fund your continued educational-video-making. You are exceptionally good at this.

 Its all great. But you started with from quantum computing and now we&#39;re playing with calculator. Negative progress, i guess.

 I can definitely see this video being used for high school CS classes. You have the great ability to break down a complex topic for non-CS people into very understandable chunks plus the video itself is pleasing to look at/listen to. Your quantum computing and raytracing videos are still my favorite though! Seriously, keep up the great work! Its rare to find someone who puts as much effort  in the visuals and the explanations as you do. I strive to be as knowledgeable as you are in computer science.
